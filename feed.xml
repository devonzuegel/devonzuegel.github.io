    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;It's been frustrating to see the US coverage of Milei, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1734335000604967191&quot;&gt;Argentina's new president&lt;/a&gt;. They are deeply misunderstanding (or misrepresenting?) what's going on. It seems the American press can only understand Argentine politics through the lens of the US, when really it's just a totally different situation. &lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/07546fd7-8385-4660-a165-17a38189fe1f/74c68a92-cf6b-4511-bfa0-4e38bc793fe4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;73&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The American press loves to call Milei a &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/election-milei-massa-runoff-6a171de948a034bd43c853f6d3f50f5c&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;, which couldn't be more incorrect.&lt;/span&gt; He ran &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;against&lt;/span&gt; the populist left (the Peronists), and all the key policies he's proposing are a direct attack on what populists want! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In particular, whenever Peronists are in power, they always print more and more pesos in order to have more money as spoils to distribute to their supporters. This patronage includes creating new government jobs (whether or not they're needed), social welfare programs, subsidies, and more This is a huge part of how the Peronists get reelected. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Printing money also wipes away household debt, because inflation eats reduces the value of the principal. This is popular because in the short term, this is good for borrowers and extremely bad for lenders, and there are far more borrowers than there are lenders. (However this is also bad for borrowers in the long term, because lenders stop lending as soon as they learn that they will lose all their money if they lend it out. As just one example consequence, there is no mortgage industry in Argentina, so it's really hard to afford a house!)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Milei intends to shut down the money printing and possibly even dollarize, i.e. use the US Dollar as the official currency. Dollarization would tie Argentina's hands forever from a monetary perspective so that if Peronists win again, they wouldn't be able to just start printing money like they always have in the past, because they'd no longer have control over the monetary policy. Long story short, &lt;b&gt;it's &lt;i&gt;anti-populist&lt;/i&gt; to halt the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; money printing gravy train&lt;/span&gt;, and it's silly that the American press keeps calling him a populist!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;erican press also loves to call Milei the &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20231202224016/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/americas/javier-milei-argentina-election.html&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Trump of Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;, a comparison that simply doesn't map to what I've seen.&lt;/span&gt; I've watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1727429312880705963&quot;&gt;many of Milei's speeches&lt;/a&gt;, and he's much more like Milton Friedman than Trump. The policies Milei says he'll push for are totally different, and he has a lot more philosophical consistency than Trump ever did. The only serious similarity I see to Trump is that they're both political outsiders who won shocking victories.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Frankly seeing the US coverage of Argentina's election makes me wonder how much the American press gets wrong when they write about other countries too… If they have no idea what they're talking about when they write about Argentina, how can I trust what they write for other countries?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;P.S. When Milei won the election a few weeks ago, I wrote a brief post about the context of why Milei was elected: &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/a-libertarian-just-won-argentina-s-presidency-what-s-going-on&quot;&gt;https://devonzuegel.com/a-libertarian-just-won-argentina-s-presidency-what-s-going-on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;If you're wondering how the heck a hardline libertarian just won the Argentinian presidential election, here's some background.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;First, a key fact is that the government is printing money at an accelerating rate, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-13/argentina-s-inflation-hits-143-in-final-release-before-election&quot;&gt;143% annual inflation&lt;/a&gt; as of the most recent count. The economy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#place=country%2FARG&amp;statsVar=Amount_EconomicActivity_GrossDomesticProduction_Nominal_PerCapita&amp;chart=%7B%22amount-PerCapita%22%3A%7B%22pc%22%3Afalse%2C%22delta%22%3Afalse%7D%7D&quot;&gt;deteriorating rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, the poverty rate has spiked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chequeado.com/el-explicador/como-evoluciono-la-pobreza-con-cada-presidente/&quot;&gt;more than 40%&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/inside-argentina-s-currency-exchange-black-markets.html&quot;&gt;daily indignities of Argentina's topsy turvy monetary policy&lt;/a&gt; are mounting. If you ask an Argentinian, it's a question of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; hyperinflation will kick in, not if.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Second, the race came down to two candidates:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sergio Massa:&lt;/span&gt; Current Minister of Economy, in charge of the state treasury. (Yes, he's they head guy overseeing the economy just as the government prints all of those increasingly worthless pesos!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Javier Milei:&lt;/span&gt; A political outsider with hardline libertarian beliefs who wants to dramatically reduce the scope of government and is seen as a loose canon for his eccentric personal beliefs.&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0f8c836e-b763-45f6-8866-2093a34510b3/b643e998-d047-4c62-9f4c-f147b35c8764.jpg&quot; width=&quot;63&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Milei is a character...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Milei's radical platform included plans to:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dollarize the economy&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. adopt the US dollar as the country's currency so that leaders like Massa can't just keep printing money. This is like Argentina tying itself to the proverbial mast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Cut a huge portion of the government&lt;/span&gt; to curb rampant corruption and patronage. An astonishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.mercopress.com/2020/07/27/in-argentina-55-of-all-registered-workers-are-employed-by-government#google_vignette&quot;&gt;55%&lt;/a&gt;* of workers registered in Argentina work for the government and directly benefit from increased government spending, so this will be extremely unpopular. (*The 55% number is a bit misleading because a lot of Argentina's economic activity is in the informal sector, so a huge portion of the workforce is not registered.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Massa represents the incumbent establishment:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Massa identifies as a Peronist, the same party as the current sitting president, Alberto Fernández. Many Argentinians think that &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Massa has been the top dog leading the government&lt;/span&gt; since Fernández's popularity waned dramatically in the past few years. (Fernández decided not to run again even though he's only in his first term.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Practically this means that &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;electing Massa would have meant more of the same&lt;/span&gt;. He would have continued solving political problems by handing out subsidies/jobs and solving the resulting fiscal shortfalls by printing more pesos.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In short, this was an election between &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;continuity vs change&lt;/span&gt;. Few predicted that Milei would win because he is... &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/artirkel/status/1726383744079348169?s=46&quot;&gt;quirky&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least. All you need to do is watch some of his YouTube videos to see that he's a bit unhinged. Sure, Massa is associated with the country's current economic woes, but people thought &quot;at least he's a known quantity and has experience in politics&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; But to everyone's surprise, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Milei won in a landslide victory!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk6S8qG6OS8&quot;&gt;Here's Milei's victory speech laying out his vision.&lt;/a&gt; His 12 point lead made it clear that Argentinians are angry – so angry that they're willing to accept abrupt, extreme changes in hopes that it gets the country on a better path. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I guess once you frame the choice as &quot;vote for (a) the current Minister of Economy who's actively guiding Argentina towards hyperinflation or (b) a guy who thinks that's a bad idea&quot;, it sounds insane that Massa was even considered a reasonable candidate, let alone a top contender! And yet he still got 44% of the vote...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Don't get me wrong, I have my reservations about Milei. I disagree with him on some key issues, and his temperament may create more problems than it solves. But I think he has the right ideas for most pressing issues Argentina is facing (namely economic ones), and I'm happy that someone is finally pointing out that the emperor has no clothes and trying to change it, rather than simply continuing down the same path that got Argentina into this mess in the first place. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; No one knows if Milei has what it takes to achieve the goals he's set out for the country. He's good at capturing attention, but is he good at leading? He lacks experience pushing policies through, and Argentinians have a tendency to ignore and resist changes from a centralized authority, so we'll see how far he gets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; But this is at least a good first step. I'm happy to see Argentinians sending a clear message that the current leaders who are leading the country further down a path of ruin that they do &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; have popular support. I'm cautiously optimistic that this could be a turning point in the country's history. Argentina is a wonderful place and deserves better. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Viva la libertad, carajo!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;As a real estate developer, one of the big decisions you need to make is whether you will &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;rent&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;sell&lt;/span&gt; the buildings you've built.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Income from rentals flows in steadily over years, while income from sales hits all at once. This essential difference is simple but has many implications for your risk profile, upside potential, capital requirements, and business model.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The following post is a writeup of my notes as I study real estate development business models. My main goal was to strengthen my own grasp of the tradeoffs, and I figured others might find it interesting too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/dc3a93d8-14c3-4c9b-8101-44b87664a56e/043001df-5c0d-45f3-9dc6-b66cd6d8be00.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Advantages of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;rentals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals are more resilient to market cycles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If a for-rent project is completed in a downturn, the rents it can command may be lower than expected, but the rents can increase later when the market improves down the road, smoothing out the overall return. For-sale properties don't have that same luxury. In a downturn, they may end up selling all of their units at once at lower prices, just to see the market take a turn for the better shortly after they've finished selling their last unit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Rents may not even go down in the first place – in downturns, people may be more likely to rent than buy, which can actually lead to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;higher&lt;/span&gt; demand for rental units. People are less likely to make a huge purchase like a home when they feel less optimistic about their wallet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the cases when rent prices do fluctuate, existing leases provide a buffer against immediate drops. Imagine you own a building with 120 units each. They're on annual leases, and in any given month, about 10 of them are up for lease renewal. If the market goes south, those 10 units may rent at a lower rate, but at least you have the existing leases from the other 110 units that reduce the impact.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals aren't exposed to construction defect lawsuits, unlike condos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the US, condo developers face a significant risk of being sued by HOAs or individual unit owners for years after a project is complete. (In California for example, the statute of limitations for construction defect claims is 10 years.) This open-ended litigation risk means that developers don't know when they might get pulled into a costly legal battle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By contrast, developers that build-to-rent don't face this risk, because they remain the owner. This makes the rental business model much more predictable compared to condo sales.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The high risk of post-construction defect lawsuits for condos has remained a major factor depressing that sector of the development industry in the US. Other countries without such extensive legal recourse periods see much stronger condo development as a result.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals provide an income stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Rental units generate a steady monthly revenue for as long as you own the property, providing a predictable cashflow that can be more sustainable and reliable over the long term. By contrast, sales result in a large lump sum upfront, i.e. one-time income that's exhausted once all units are sold. This can be a pro or a con, depending on your goals and financial capacity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals align the developer's interests with the long-term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Developers who build-to-rent have more of a vested interest in the long-term health of their projects compared to developers who build-to-sell. It shifts the focus from quick short-term gains (&quot;what flashy features will sell this thing as quickly as possible?&quot;) to long-term asset management (&quot;how should I invest upfront to ensure that my tenants are happy long-term and to reduce future maintenance?&quot;). This long-term skin in the game promotes better building quality and maintenance practices.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, rooftop pools are a big selling point for many big apartment buildings. However, rooftop pools are a maintenance nightmare and can create major structural issues down the road. As a result, developers who build-to-rent tend to put the pool on a lower level of the building, because even though it makes the building slightly less exciting for prospective residents, it saves the owner a big maintenance bill down the line. By contrast, developers who build-to-sell will often bite the bullet and point the pool on the roof, because by the time the structural damage has taken its toll, the HOA and condo owners will be the ones responsible for it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals allow developers to benefit from property value appreciation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Long-term ownership allows developers to benefit from property value appreciation over time. This can be an especially valuable in situations where the developer has succeeded at &quot;placemaking&quot;, i.e. taking an area and turning it into a salient destination. Placemaking can increase property values in the entire neighborhood, and if the developer is responsible for creating that value, they would like to hold onto the property rather than sell it right upon completion, because it takes time for property values to adjust to reflect the new value.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Disneyland is a classic example. Disney transformed agricultural land in Southern California into one of the most desirable destinations in the world, and in doing so it dramatically raised the value of the land it owns beyond what another buyer would have done. By holding the property long-term rather than selling it after the initial development is done, Disney saw a major increase in the value of this asset.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In fact not only do you want to continue to own your &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; land in a situation like this, but you also want to own the land &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;around&lt;/span&gt; it. Disneyland raised the value of not only the land that the corporation itself owned but also all of the land around it. Famously, one of Walt Disney's greatest regrets was not buying more of the land surrounding Disneyland, because this increase in land value was essentially a huge free gift from the Disney company to the farmers who happened to own the neighboring land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Long-term holds have much more favorable tax treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When properties are built with the intention of immediate sale, they are treated as inventory by the IRS, rather than long-term investments. Any profits generated from inventory sales are subject to short-term capital gains, which can be significantly higher than long-term capital gains. Short-term gains are taxed as normal income at the developer's applicable income tax bracket, which can exceed 30% for high profit margins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In contrast, profits from properties held over a year before sale qualify for preferential long-term capital gains rates of 15-20% depending on the individual's taxable income level. Holding properties long-term as investment real estate also allows depreciation deductions to be claimed annually to offset rental income and further reduce taxes owed over the investment horizon. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Additionally, build-to-rent or build-to-hold strategies utilizing long-term financing like loans or syndications benefit from capital gains tax deferral until the asset is liquidated. As long as the loan balance exceeds the property's depreciated tax basis, no capital gains taxes are due, even if the property appreciates significantly in value.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a result, developers seeking to maximize after-tax returns generally favor business models that are not dependent on immediate sale profit realization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Advantages of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;sales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;If you can time the market, you can make a killing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although you can certainly get on the wrong side of a market cycle, you can also get lucky and have your shiny new units hit the market right at the peak of the cycle. When this happens, developers make outsized returns, because they make all of their money in one lump sum, and at a time when the market is willing to pay the most.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;You don't need to raise as much equity for the project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Instead of raising as much money from investors, developers can do pre-sales to count towards their equity portion as required by construction lenders. These pre-sales are often 5-10% of the purchase price. This can bring in substantial capital to serve as equity, and it also shows lenders that there is real demand for what the developer is building, which helps them get more comfortable with lending to the project.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;States have varying regulations regarding how developers can handle pre-sale deposits from condo buyers. For example, Florida has some of the strictest pre-sale regulations. Developers in Florida must meet certain escrow, reserve funding, and construction completion milestones before they can sell a significant portion of units. By contrast, Texas developers have more flexibility to sell units earlier in the development process before construction milestones are met.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Pre-sales can be a trial balloon before you go all-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another advantage of build-to-sell over build-to-rent is that developers can test market demand through pre-sales before committing to construction. With build-to-rent, developers must secure financing upfront to fund the entire project. But with build-to-sell, pre-sales can gauge buyer interest and absorption rates. Developers can decide not to move forward with construction if pre-sales come in below projections. In contrast, with build-to-rent projects, you’re all-in and hoping people rent it once it’s built.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Cash now, instead of cash later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When developers sell homes upon completion of a project, they are able to fully realize the value of that project in one lump sum payment. This sizable infusion of cash can then be used to pay off any construction loans or lines of credit that financed the project. It also frees up capital that can be reinvested immediately into the next development venture. Not having to wait monthly or annually for rental income to be realized can significantly accelerate a developer's cash flow and funding availability for future projects. The ability to swiftly recoup costs and move on to new opportunities is appealing to developers looking to rapidly grow and scale their business through continual development.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is especially true when interest rates are high, because the opportunity cost of delayed payments increases as interest rates increase. Cash now is worth more than cash in the future, since that money can begin earning interest right away. Loans are also more expensive as interest rates rise, so getting cash from sales now to pay down high-interest debt more quickly is more important than when interest rates are low.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Your development company can grow faster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The lump sum that comes back to you from a sale can be reinvested into new projects, fueling growth and expansion. Instead of waiting years or decades to make up the total amount to then reinvest into new projects, they can scale at a more rapid pace by recycling profits from previous projects into new opportunities sooner.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;It's not all-or-nothing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sell some, rent some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Some developers balance the pros and cons of both business models by mixing the two product types into one project. They'll sometimes sell some units upfront to pay off lenders and investors, and then maintain the rest of the property as rentals to benefit from the stable, long-term income they generate. For example, in Seaside, FL, the developer took this mixed approach. They sold individual lots for homes but deliberately kept the retail spaces and some apartment units as long-term holdings to generate a consistent rental income stream.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However this approach has been used less and less over time for condo buildings. By only holding onto some, the developer is now inserting themselves into a fractured ownership position with the association, which is a management nightmare. Lenders also don’t finance these as favorably because of the fractured ownership structure. (These issues don't apply in the Seaside case, because Seaside's developer was building an entire neighborhood split among different properties, rather than units within a single building.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rent now, sell later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Some developers employ a hold strategy where they initially rent out units for some time before selling (typically 5-10 years) to capture appreciation. This allows values to rise as the property establishes itself and units are fully rented (i.e. the property has &quot;stabilized&quot;). After several years of cash flow from rents, the property is then sold at a profit reflecting the increased value.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Cash-out refinance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another method that developers like to use is the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cash-out refinance&lt;/span&gt;, because it gives an immediate cash infusion without having to sell the property. A cash-out refinance is when a property owner refinances their existing mortgage with a larger loan. The difference between the original loan amount and the new, larger refinance loan is given to the borrower in cash. This can be a way for a real estate developer to access capital without having to sell a property.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Let's say a developer owns an apartment building currently financed with a $500,000 mortgage. The building is now worth $800,000. Through a cash-out refinance, the developer could take out a new $800,000 loan to pay off the original $500,000 balance and have $300,000 in cash from the refinance. They can reinvest this money back into the property, use it to invest in future projects, or simply take it out as distributions to investors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The refinance may also come with a lower interest rate, if the building has become more stable and established over time. For example, a brand new building that hasn't leased any units yet will get a higher interest rate than a building that's full of tenants. So even if the value of the building hasn't gone way up, a refinance can still be beneficial for lowering the owner's monthly payments.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Cash-out refinancing may sound like a magical solution where you can eat your cake and have it too, but it has its limits and isn't always an option. For instance, it likely isn't an option if the property's value has declined below the existing loan amount. Lenders want to make sure the new, larger loan is secured by equity in the property. So if a property is worth less than what's currently owed, the lender has no equity to use for a cash-out refinance. Similarly, a refinance may not pencil out if interest rates have shot up, because monthly payments might be more than before even if the property is more stabilized than before. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A shorthand for thinking about these pros and cons: rentals are generally lower variance, while sales are generally higher variance. They fall into different parts of the risk-reward spectrum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Depending on your goals, financial capacity, and risk tolerance, rentals and sales each serve different roles in shaping an overall strategy for a development company and its investors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So, you’ve been invited to an unconference! Maybe you’re not entirely sure what that means (did the organizers misspell &quot;conference&quot;?), or maybe you’ve been to dozens of these before and you’re looking for some ideas for how to run an awesome session.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This blog post will be a quick primer on what an unconference is, and then we’ll share some tips on how to make a session excellent, both as the host and as a participant.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: -12px&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;TABLE OF CONTENTS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what&quot;&gt;What is an unconference?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#theme&quot;&gt;Selecting a session theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#formats&quot;&gt;Ideas for session formats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tactics&quot;&gt;Tactics for running a great session&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#failure&quot;&gt;Common failure modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#attendee&quot;&gt;How to be a great session attendee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#help&quot;&gt;Help us make this doc better!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What is an unconference?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Unconferences are participant-driven. &lt;/span&gt;The agenda is created by the attendees when they arrive at the event, and anyone can propose and host a session on a topic they want to discuss. This is in contrast to a typical conference, where the organizers design a schedule of talks and events in advance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;An unconference is a shared project. &lt;/span&gt;The unconference format is designed to break down the distinction between session hosts and participants. While a conventional conference treats attendees like a passive audience to be entertained by the organizers, the unconference format gives everyone who attends an opportunity to make the event awesome. By giving each guest ownership over how the time is spent, it turns the event into a shared project. Building things together builds strong relationships, and it can blossom into longer-running collaborations after the event.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Unconferences are choose-your-own-adventure.&lt;/span&gt; At any moment there will be multiple talks happening in parallel, and you can attend whichever one piques your interest. At a typical unconference, a majority of participants will facilitate at least one session.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The unconference board is the center of the event.&lt;/span&gt; The board is a large grid representing the schedule. The time slots start out blank, and over the course of the unconference, attendees fill them out by proposing sessions. These can change throughout the event as people get to know each other. For example, if you meet someone with complementary expertise, you might consider inviting them to co-host it with you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 419px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 419px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/954839a3-6112-4785-a6d0-21d9eea0c470/f0217436-1d0b-4091-a46e-de6328fb2806.png&quot; width=&quot;624&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;An example of an unconference board after it has been filled out by the attendees.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;theme&quot;&gt;Selecting a session theme&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All topics are fair game at unconferences (unless the organizers specifically state a more narrow theme, of course). Here are a few categories of themes to get your juices flowing:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Your professional expertise&lt;/span&gt; (e.g. mining black holes, how to create real estate pro forma, environmental review regulatory reform)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Something you’re passionate about&lt;/span&gt; (e.g. pottery, quantified self, your experience going through IVF, a standup comedy set)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;A group experience&lt;/span&gt; (e.g. improv, acrylic pouring, cooking class, giant jigsaw puzzle, blind &quot;dining in the dark&quot; dinner, board games, photography workshop)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;A physical activity&lt;/span&gt; (e.g. stretching, group hike, hunting for four leaf clovers, breathing exercises, square dancing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;formats&quot;&gt;Ideas for session formats&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An unconference is an opportunity to mix it up when it comes to format. While conference-style talks can be awesome additions to unconferences too, sessions that take a more interactive or creative approach are where unconferences shine. Here are some ideas for formats that you might consider for your session:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Fireside chat.&lt;/span&gt; An informal conversation between an interviewer and a guest speaker, usually in a cozy setting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Facilitated group discussion about an important question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Pre-prepared talk + Q&amp;A.&lt;/span&gt; This one is the most similar to what you’ve seen at conferences. To take advantage of an unconference's informality, we encourage you to pause more often for audience reactions or questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Lightning talks.&lt;/span&gt; You can organize a mini series of short, 5-10 minute presentations on a topic. The series could have a specific theme, or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Impromptu panel.&lt;/span&gt; After a round of intros, you pick 2-5 experts and form a panel. You can be moderator, or you can ask one of the experts to ask good questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Demo of a new technology. &lt;/span&gt;Brownie points if it's a live demo! But make sure you're prepared so that there aren't lots of awkward gaps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Live podcast.&lt;/span&gt; Ask another attendee if you can interview them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Science experiment.&lt;/span&gt; Design an experiment that the group can test together during the session. It doesn’t necessarily have to fit in the 1 hour session; the experiment could run throughout the event and bear results at the end, or possibly even after the unconference is over.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Group brainstorm in a Google Doc. &lt;/span&gt;This is a much higher bandwidth brainstorm format than a single-threaded group conversation. Pose some good questions, ask everyone to type their responses underneath each question, and allow people to comment afterwards. Tip: start by spending 3 minutes &quot;brainstorming ways to brainstorm&quot;, then pick your favorite 2-3 ideas and spend the session on those.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Hot seat.&lt;/span&gt; Break into small groups of 3-5 (zoom or IRL), then pick someone to be on the hot seat first. That person chooses a &quot;spicy-ness&quot; level of questions they're comfortable asking. Spicer meaning more vulnerable/personal. For 5 minutes, anyone can jump in and ask questions, one at a time. Switch after 5 minutes. (Thanks to Bhaumik Patel for emailing us this suggestion!) Tips:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Break the ice by going first in front of whole group. Choose the highest spicy level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have sample questions people can ask.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;If someone is shy, let them know they can skip any question&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suggest no more than 1 minute per answer to keep pace going.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;tactics&quot;&gt;Tactics for running a great session&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here are some creative facilitation moves that might improve the flow of your session. You don’t need to do all or even any of these. They’re just here to give get your juices flowing as you plan.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ask everyone why they're interested. &lt;/span&gt;&quot;Let's go around and say a sentence or two about any specific questions you'd like me to address.&quot; Good for making a Q&amp;A more targeted to people's curiosities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Intros.&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Let's go around and say a sentence or two about why you're here and your familiarity with this topic.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Play with the length of time. &lt;/span&gt;Unconference boards are typically broken down into 1-hour blocks, but that doesn’t mean your session has to be 1 hour! You could take over 2 contiguous time blocks to make a mega 2-hour session, or you could use just 30 minutes if you don’t need the full hour.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Invite specific people to attend your session. &lt;/span&gt;Think about who at the event will have interesting things to add to the discussion and ask them if they’d like to attend your session.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Promote your session in the group chat.&lt;/span&gt; Many unconference organizers will create a group chat for everyone to get announcements throughout the event. 10 minutes before your session starts, you can message the group chat to tell them about your session and who you think would find it interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Invite everyone to sit on the floor. &lt;/span&gt;This can make the session feel more playful and casual. (You can also just remove all of the chairs from the room beforehand, then they will have to sit on the floor!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Choose an appropriate seating layout. &lt;/span&gt;If you want to encourage interactivity, choose a space where chairs are arranged in a circle. If you want to draw everyone's attention to a speaker or a panel, choose a space where chairs are oriented towards a stage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Bring a physical artifact.&lt;/span&gt; Having a physical object related to what you’re working on can make what you’re talking about more real. You can think of it as grownup show and tell!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Find a cohost.&lt;/span&gt; Think about who might have overlapping/complementary expertise and invite them to run the session with you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Discuss a topic you’ve written about in depth before.&lt;/span&gt; Some of the best sessions we’ve seen have been writers sharing a quick overview of an essay or book they’ve written, and then giving audience members time for Q&amp;A so the discussion can go beyond what they’ve published publicly. Another variant of this is that you could print out copies of the essay and ask people to read it in silence for the first 5-10 minutes of your session.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Oblique strategies.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html&quot;&gt;This set of cards&lt;/a&gt; with cryptic prompts is helpful for breaking creative blocks. Draw a card at random and it might help stimulate new ideas and ways to approach your work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Create a way for people to keep up the discussion after. &lt;/span&gt;Start a group chat, promote a mailing list, or plan a dinner after the event.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Limit the number of people in your session.&lt;/span&gt; If you want to have a small group discussion, for example, you can tell people &quot;The first 8 people who show up will get to be part of the discussion. If you come after that, you can sit quietly as an audience member&quot; or some variation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ask someone to be the notetaker. &lt;/span&gt;Have them share their notes afterwards with the group or with the rest of the unconference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;failure&quot;&gt;Common failure modes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The host is under-prepared.&lt;/span&gt; This is the most common failure mode. Although unconferences are designed to be casual, you should still take the role of hosting a session seriously. We've seen amazing sessions that required zero prep, but it's a high variance strategy. A host should at least be able to ask the right questions if a conversation falters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The session feels scripted.&lt;/span&gt; Long, non-interactive presentations miss what makes unconferences special. The fix is to encourage group participation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Intros take up the whole session. &lt;/span&gt;Beware the Law of Intro Inflation: that each intro tends to take slightly longer than the previous one. For a group of less than 10 people, intros usually take about 10 minutes. For 10-20 people, you'll need to ask people to keep it to 2 sentences or less. For a large group of 20 or more people, beware, and don’t hesitate to be the Bad Cop!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;A few loud voices dominate the conversation.&lt;/span&gt; A great facilitator is a great host, which means encouraging quiet participants to contribute and being willing to gently interrupt the long-winded.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The topic goes off the rails.&lt;/span&gt; If your topic degenerates into a debate about capitalism, a great host will find a way to get it back on track.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The format is over-structured. &lt;/span&gt;We've seen 45 minute sessions with 15 steps (e.g. 1 minute of silent brainstorming, followed by 3 minutes of talking to your neighbors, repeated 4 times, etc). Sometimes this works, but what usually happens is that participants feel like their conversations are repeatedly cut short.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Only a few people show up.&lt;/span&gt; This can often be a feature and not a bug, and pivot to a more intimate, tailored conversation. Sometimes these end up being the best sessions, because they give the small group a chance to go deeper. You can also always cancel the session.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Too many people show up for your format. &lt;/span&gt;The fix depends on the format, but it could involve trying it anyway, pivoting to select an expert panel, dividing the crowd into small groups, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;First-timers don't participate. &lt;/span&gt;Unconferences are wonderfully informal, and you don't need experience to host. If you're shy, try cohosting with another attendee! Alternatively, you can prepare a session and decide after day 1 whether or not to put your session up on the calendar. It can also be encouraging to ask others for their feedback on your topic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;attendee&quot;&gt;How to be a great session attendee&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everyone is responsible for making an unconference great, not just the session host! Here are some ways you can support the host in making each session great: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask questions and add comments&lt;/span&gt;, as long as the host seems they would appreciate it. Unconferences are designed to be more interactive than traditional conferences, and it should be more of a back-and-forth between hosts and participants rather than a performer-audience relationship.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Help the host keep time.&lt;/span&gt; It’s easy to lose track of time, especially when you’re facilitating a great discussion!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Share your own experiences&lt;/span&gt;, though also make sure you’re respecting the host’s intention for the session and not dominating the conversation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Don’t look at your phone!&lt;/span&gt; This one should be obvious, yet somehow it seems not to be…&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot; id=&quot;help&quot;&gt;Help us make this post better!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Do you have ideas for ho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;w to create a great&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;unconference experience?

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;The saga of Israeli water management is one of the most inspiring stories of the last 75 years. Israel went from having a serious water problem to being a net water exporter to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, the population grew from ~1 million to well over 9 million.&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/b45a3e3a-2903-4c0c-b58a-2ad579ad14ed.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With its land mass 60% desert, the region was originally thought to support a max population of just 2 million people. But with tireless work, financial support to find new solutions, and brilliant technological advances, Israel was able to blow past those limits.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There was no one silver bullet. Israel's water crisis was averted through a portfolio approach. The country invested in a wide range of solutions of varying cost, timelines, and chance of success. Here are a few breakthroughs that were especially powerful:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Drip irrigation:&lt;/span&gt; Israeli engineers invented drip irrigation in the 1960s, replacing traditional flood irrigation. This method saves up to 90% of the water and boosts yields 10-90% (depending on crop type), because it controls water application to match the exact needs of each plant, and it reduces nutrient runoff compared to flood irrigation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/54edc06d-ab98-4500-bf0b-f85ef71438c9.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Desalination:&lt;/span&gt; Israel played a huge role in proving that desalination can be economically viable. The country desalinates 75% of its drinking water from the Mediterranean, and it has built some of the largest and most advanced desalination plants in the world.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/97fb5f4e-5368-4d98-a53f-51043a844a82.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Wastewater reuse:&lt;/span&gt; Recycled wastewater is a large and growing source of water in Israel, accounting for &gt;25% of the country's water supply. They reuse &lt;a href=&quot;https://fluencecorp.com/israel-leads-world-in-water-recycling&quot;&gt;90%&lt;/a&gt; of their sewage for agricultural irrigation; for comparison, the US reuses &lt;10%.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/c46730e7-2d9a-467f-b216-cd6101310cf4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Improved crop varieties:&lt;/span&gt; Israeli agricultural scientists have developed new crop varieties that are more resistant to heat, drought, and saline conditions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/ca0c9b77-347d-400c-8158-cbb89acde161.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Real pricing:&lt;/span&gt; Most countries subsidize water. For a long time, Israel was no exception. But in 2009, they started charging people for the real price of the water they consumed. Without rationing or limiting supply, real pricing induced households to cut water use by 16%!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cf8200fb-235f-417d-a147-4a55be480c35/0a7ba9ad-82e4-4370-b6e5-dba0fd31dfea.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you're interested to learn more, and if you want a spark of hope and a reminder that humans can solve hard problems, I highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3r8b84j&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Let There Be Water: Israel's Solution for a Water-Starved World&lt;/a&gt; by Seth Siegel. It put me in such a good mood and was full of interesting technical details too!&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;America hasn't built many walkable places in the last few decades, but there are a few exceptions. While collecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrvwBRWQxSE7dy4o&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;a list of these special places&lt;/a&gt;, I was shocked to discover that most are in the Southeast. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My mental image of contemporary southern development did not include an appreciation of urbanism, walkability, and public spaces. On the contrary, it conjured images of massive highways and repetitive suburban sprawl. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There certainly is a lot of that type of development too, and yet almost all of the best new urban fabric in the last few decades has happened south of the Mason-Dixon line.&lt;div style=&quot;display:none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/d027c6cc-66e6-4271-81cd-f7b2e6ed1251.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 743px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 743px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/a934d9d8-bd71-4bdf-8b08-e4b9a15b4879.png&quot; width=&quot;507px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A map of New Urbanist villages that &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrvwBRWQxSE7dy4o&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;I've been collecting&lt;/a&gt;. Notice the clusters in South Carolina, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This clustering in the South makes more sense now that I've studied the question of why the US doesn't build more walkable neighborhoods and towns. The first, obvious answer is that the South generally has less land use regulation than the Northeast and the West Coast, giving real estate developers more latitude in how they build. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A prime example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/seaside&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Seaside&lt;/a&gt;, the 80-acre village in Florida that kicked off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newurbanism.org/newurbanism/principles.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;New Urbanism&lt;/a&gt; movement in the early 1980s. The stretch of the Florida Panhandle where Seaside sits was such a backwater that the county didn't even have a Planning Department when Seaside was first getting built! As a result, the creators of Seaside had an incredible amount of freedom to build to their vision.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 328px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 250px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/249214bd-0e48-413e-b051-ddb4f0c68422.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth:564; --en-naturalHeight:438;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/9714cbc7-a5f1-434f-a9a1-2af791f2d7c1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;215px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 328px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/c1a4fbda-cd72-46fd-a09d-15525710ecf8.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth:428; --en-naturalHeight:640;&quot; width=&quot;196&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 16px&quot;&gt;Seaside, FL was built in the 1980s but feels like a classic small town built before the car. One of my favorite details in Seaside is the secret walking paths winding through each cluster of homes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But as I've learned more, I don't think this concentration of new walkable places in the Southeast is just about more open-minded regulation. Notably, even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gainesvilleregister.com/opinion/columns/snuggs-all-about-county-zoning/article_41c9975a-6d54-11ea-a2c4-2f66821220c8.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Texas bars counties from imposing zoning codes&lt;/a&gt;, Texas doesn't have many of these places (at least that I know of). And yet the development that has been sprouting up all around Texas is rarely mixed-use, even though there is nothing standing in developers' way from a zoning perspective. If the lack of good new walkable places was just a function of restrictive land use policy, you would see more of this type of development in unincorporated parts of Texas counties!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think another critical factor is that Seaside served as a model of success, which became the seed of a growing community of practice throughout the region. Seaside provided a example for developers and public officials to point at and say, &quot;Wow, that model of development worked out great in the neighboring county. Let's build something like that here, too.&quot; People are much more likely to learn about models of development that are close by rather than across the country, because they're easier to go see in person and it's more likely that someone they know has been there. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Planning departments are risk-averse, and they have lots of reasons to be that way. They get little credit when they approve an unconventional project that the public loves; meanwhile they get an earful if they approve one that the public hates. As a result, having a successful example of a new development model nearby makes it a much easier ask for an official to take a swing at a big idea.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 340px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 340px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/8ab5f2a9-6549-4bf3-b2c0-8d89b785e1aa.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth:1500; --en-naturalHeight:521;&quot; width=&quot;599px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption center&quot;&gt;Fun fact: Seaside was the movie set for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nearby role models are possibly even more important for developers. One aspect of real estate that I didn't appreciate before is just how driven by comparables the industry is (known in the industry as &quot;comps&quot;). Developers are constantly asking themselves &quot;What other projects in this region have succeeded? Which have failed?&quot; and then shaping their projects to match the successes and avoid the failures. As a result, the industry is very self-referential and self-reinforcing. What gets built today is typically just a slight variation of what got built yesterday. Changing the zoning and building codes is risky, non-deterministic, and political; meanwhile it's much more straightforward to just do what's already been done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Besides land use regulation, financing projects with debt is another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-great-filter-a-possible-solution-to-the-fermi-paradox/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Great Filter&lt;/a&gt; that kills innovative projects, or at least nudges them in a more conventional direction. Lenders are understandably risk-averse, because they get no upside if the project does spectacularly well. If a developer's bold bet pays off, the lender gets the same amount of money as if it did just ok; meanwhile the lender can lose all of their money if the project fails. As a result, lenders will often insist on making the project as similar as possible to something that they've already seen work. To lenders, boring is a feature not a bug.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The obvious way to avoid this Great Filter is to simply not use debt. However, leveraging a project with debt makes returns much more attractive to equity investors, so it's often necessary to make a project competitive as an investment. If real estate were funded by pure equity rather than debt, I think we would see a lot more experimentation. And indeed, the most innovative real estate projects are often funded by wealthy individuals with deep pockets who don't need to bring on debt to fill out the capital stack. If a project is special enough that it makes for outsized returns even without debt, then it can work out very well for investors in the end too. However, getting that multiple with debt doesn't require innovation in the end product, and thus feels safer to many investors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Those rare innovative projects that do get built have outsized impact on the industry, because they can prove out a model that more conservative capital can then invest in. Seaside, FL was originally built by a single developer with a crazy idea and a piece of land he already owned, which gave him time and autonomy to build his vision. By contrast, most developers are working on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/span&gt; borrowed time, so they don't have the luxury of experimenting with a new model.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But then once a place like Seaside has proven out a model, then other developers can take those learnings and apply them to projects with more conventional investors and lenders. As Seaside took off, nearby communities popped up along the Florida Panhandle following their playbook, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://alysbeach.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Alys Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.30aescapes.com/rosemary-beach-community&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Rosemary Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitsouthwalton.com/neighborhoods/watercolor/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Watercolor&lt;/a&gt;. Disney also took note of the Seaside model and built &lt;a href=&quot;https://celebrationtowncenter.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Celebration, FL&lt;/a&gt; following many of the same design principles. Developers just over the border in Georgia and South Carolina began to take note too, building beautiful places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ioncommunity.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;I'On&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newpointsc.com/default.php&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Newpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palmettobluff.com/live/wilson-village&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Palmetto Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2021/05/11/%E2%80%98green-streets%E2%80%99-gentle-density-new-studio-town&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Trillith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sherikoones/2019/03/05/serenbe-an-agrihood-community-to-visit-or-stay-forever/?sh=72c71e333f5a&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Serenbe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://habershamsc.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Habersham&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 173px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 172px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 173px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4f4d0ed2-1489-4b82-9e61-88a3f032474e/a2778f08-5a93-412e-8960-7f1144c0b9b1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth:800; --en-naturalHeight:1106;&quot; width=&quot;168px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;These design patterns, loosely referred to as &quot;New Urbanism&quot;, are slowly spreading from the South into the rest of the country. As you can see from the map at the top of this post, there are some lovely places popping up in &lt;a rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2023/02/06/washington-beach-town-based-northwest-vernacular&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230502202651/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/business/culdesac-tempe-phoenix-sprawl.html&quot;&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; href=&quot;https://www.doverkohl.com/southmain&quot;&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wheelerdistrict.com/&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond (and those are just my count – it's very likely that I'm missing some!). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However the South is still the epicenter of this community of practice, and I can count on one hand the number of New Urbanist communities that have been built west of the Mississippi or north of the Mason-Dixon line. If we can show more people that these places are existing and thriving, and expand the community of practice beyond the Southeast, we will see more wonderful places built across America.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;A question that's puzzled me for a while is why home buyers focus on price/sqft so much more than renters. I asked around for what other people thought and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1611069189078548480&quot;&gt;got some interesting answers&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to write up my takeaways.&lt;div style=&quot;display: none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/585172ff-b756-4d76-a7dc-112bab44384e/bb9fcfa1-90c0-4072-8211-9af70e2c2c05.jpg&quot; width=&quot;119&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;I. Investments demand legibility&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Homeownership is an investment &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; consumption good, while renting is just a consumption good. As a result, buyers are forced to think of it in more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/&quot;&gt;legible&lt;/a&gt; ways as opposed to just an amenity bundle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;buyers, a house serves as both a personal residence and also an asset that can be sold for a profit later on. As as a result, buyers tend to be more concerned with how the market values the property, and how much it might be worth when it comes time to sell.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The mechanics of buying and selling homes basically force you to consider price/sqft:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When you sell, the realtor you hire will figure out how much it can sell for buy looking at &quot;comps&quot;, comparisons to similar properties that have sold in the area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When you buy, the bank will determine how much to lend you based on an appraisal, which in turn is done in terms of comps and price/sqft.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Realtors, banks, institutional investors, and appraisers do this because they need a way to understand where the house sits as fungible asset among the market. Price/sqft makes a home more abstract and fungible, enabling them to boil down a unique asset to a small set of dimensions that can be sorted in a spreadsheet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Renters generally care only about how much they personally value the property, rather than its long-term value or how others will perceive its value. They are focused on finding a place that meets their immediate needs and budget and tend to think about a property as a total amenity bundle: how many bedrooms/bathrooms, how close to work, whether there's a balcony, how nice the kitchen is, etc. They do care about spaciousness, but it's one of many aspects of the property that they look at.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;II. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Owners renovate more than renters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Homebuyers see square footage as a blank canvas that can be transformed to fit their needs and preferences, while renters are less able or willing to renovate their space. Landlords tend to be conservative about how much a tenant can change their space, so having extra square footage that's poorly used doesn't add much value to the renter. Even if the landlord is open to the tenant modifying the unit, renters are less motivated to invest as much in renovations since the value goes back to the landlord rather than to the renters themselves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Side note: This dynamic is totally different in commercial leasing. In that context, tenant buildout and modification of the space is often taken as a given, and the price/sqft is often the headline advertised number. When the market is soft, commercial lease negotiations can even include concessions from the landlord to pay for some of the improvements chosen by the tenant.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;III. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sqft is less accurate for rentals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Square footage is a more reliable metric for measuring the usable space of single-family houses, whose layouts tend to have fewer constraints. It is not as accurate for measuring the usable space of rental units because they tend to have more irregular floor plans. This is especially true for apartments, which may have odd shapes or unusable space due to the need to fit a large number of units into a small area or because they are located in a converted building. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;IV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rentals rarely list &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;square footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;, while sales listings almost always do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another reason why renters might pay less attention to price/sqft is because rental listings rarely list it. Meanwhile, sale listings almost always include price/sqft. Of course the causality may run the other way – maybe the listings don't include those metrics because people don't care – but I'm sure that if landlords started highlighting price/sqft, renters would pay marginally more attention to those metrics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;V. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Renters are more likely in survival mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;People who are just trying to survive are more likely to rent than to buy, because they tend to have less access to capital and cash flow. This means they are going for whatever they can afford, not trying to optimize. Meanwhile buyers are considering between different investments. Buyers also likely have more options to begin with, and metrics like price/sqft are only really useful as a comparison point between multiple options.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;VI. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Renting just isn't as important a decision as buying&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The simplest answer might just be that renting just isn't such a big deal, while buying a home is often the single biggest financial decision a person will make in their their life. Renting is typically just a 6-18 month lease, while buying ties you to the asset until you can sell. As a result, you just don't take the decision as seriously and thus look at fewer metrics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;People are even less likely to look at the price/sqft of a hotel rooms, because it's a much lower impact decision in the first place if you're only there for a few days. Some renters know the price/sqft, but I've never heard of any travelers cite the nightly price/sqft of a hotel room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Whenever I think about physical places, I find myself coming back to a few types of numbers again and again.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;In Argentina, your money is worth double if you skip the airport currency exchange and instead go to one of the many black market exchanges hidden throughout Buenos Aires.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These illegal exchanges are called &quot;cuevas&quot; (the word for &quot;cave&quot; in Spanish), and they are a crucial part of Argentina's financial infrastructure. Argentinians are constantly exchanging their pesos (ARS) for other currencies, usually US dollars (USD), and back again because they simply cannot rely on their country's fiat currency. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The value of ARS is infamously unstable. The country's money supply has persistently high inflation, punctuated by bouts of hyperinflation. Argentina has seen an &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.elpais.com/usa/2021-03-05/argentinas-perpetual-crisis.html#:~:text=Since%201921%2C%20when%20it%20was,peso%20ley%20from%201970%20to&quot;&gt;average of 100% annual inflation for the last century&lt;/a&gt;. In 1989, inflation reached 3,000%!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The government has also imposed strict capital controls that make moving money in and out of the country challenging. It is impossible to take USD out of Argentinian ATMs, even as an American with a US bank account.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Argentinians who vacation in Costa Rica or pay their child's college tuition in Miami have to pay exorbitant taxes to move money out of the country, or sometimes cannot move the money at all. As a result, these sorts of transactions require an illegal workaround.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;ARS has a pegged exchange rate, meaning its value is not set by market demand like USD but rather is set by government mandate — and the pegged exchange rate almost always overstates the value of the peso. As a result, there is a thriving black market that sets a floating, informal exchange rate called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/&quot;&gt;Dólar Blue&lt;/a&gt;. These two rates are often dramatically different: as of early 2022, the official ARS to USD exchange rate is 110 to 1, while the informal is 215 to 1. If you bring $1 USD to a legal exchange, you get just 110 ARS pesos, whereas you’ll get 215 ARS pesos in return for that same dollar at a cueva.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a result of these challenges, there is a lot of demand to move money around without the government’s visibility. Illegal money movement is so common that it's discussed as openly and casually as people in the US might discuss what bank they use.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This backdrop makes Argentina a &lt;a href=&quot;https://restofworld.org/2022/why-crypto-crash-different-latin-america/&quot;&gt;poster child for cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. The argument from crypto proponents is that Argentinians have personally experienced the problems of centralized fiat currency for generations, so they're especially receptive to the case for decentralized currencies that their government cannot meddle with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Crypto enthusiasts are correct in many ways. I know an Argentinian grandma who barely uses a computer, yet as soon as she heard about Bitcoin from her grandson in 2016, she instantly said &quot;Money the government can't touch? Help me buy it right now,&quot; and she's been holding it ever since. (An understandable reaction when you've seen your country go through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_peso&quot;&gt;5 different currencies in your lifetime&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've also seen firsthand how crypto has transformed the way the black market operates in Argentina. When I first started visiting the country on a yearly basis in 2018, cuevas generally only advertised exchange rates between ARS and other fiat currencies, such as USD and the euro (EUR). Now, they've added the exchange rates between BTC, ETH, TRON, and other cryptocurrencies to the menu because more and more of their customers are demanding it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, the specific ways crypto is used in Argentina are quite different from how many people who are building out the crypto ecosystem originally imagined it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, crypto enthusiasts often imagine a world where individuals control their own wallets directly — storing the cryptographic code on their local computers or phones, not using a third party, like MetaMask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But the reality on the ground is quite different: Argentinian crypto users use intermediaries and centralized apps to access crypto. This is especially striking given the reasons Argentinians use crypto in the first place, which you’d expect to make them especially receptive to the value proposition of decentralization. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The peso lost almost all its value in a generation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you'd saved $100,000 USD worth of pesos in 1995, they would be worth about $310 USD today. In the mid 1990s, 1 ARS = $1 USD; as of July 2022, the value is 322 ARS = $1 USD. Anyone who held onto pesos in that time would have had their life savings obliterated. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Argentinians have learned that it's much better to save in other countries' currencies, and the favorite for decades has been USD, particularly in the form of $100 bills. In 1995, a paper from the Federal Reserve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/dollarization-in-argentina.htm&quot;&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;Argentina has received as much as $40 billion in net shipments of U.S. currency, or well over $1,000 per capita,&quot; and the number has likely only increased since then.&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cd22ee2a-ef98-46f5-ad43-c9782615825d/9ff52af7-74f2-4b39-9138-5b50e4d973bd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;108&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Argentinians have also learned to not trust banks, even with accounts denominated in other currencies. In 2001-2002, the government enacted something called &quot;el corralito&quot;, shutting Argentinians' access to their bank accounts for almost a year. When they could finally extract money again, they found that (a) their USD deposits had to be exchanged for pesos and (b) pesos had lost 2/3 of their value. The lesson the Argentines learned was that they couldn't trust banks or any other government-regulated financial services, because at any moment the government could just stop them from accessing their money.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've seen more $100 dollar bills in Argentina than I've seen in my entire lifetime in the US. $100 bills make up 80% of all US currency by value and 34% of all bills in circulation, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/34778/1/MPRA_paper_34778.pdf&quot;&gt;economist Edgar Feige&lt;/a&gt;, and there are more &quot;Benjamins&quot; floating around than all of the $5 and $10 notes combined. This is unintuitive to most Americans – $100 bills are a rare sighting, at least for me. This is not unintuitive to Argentinians, whose family has probably saved stacks of $100 bills under mattresses for generations. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Bricks — actual bricks, not stacks of cash — are another common savings mechanism, especially for working-class Argentinians. The value of bricks is fairly stable, and they're useful to a family building out their house. Argentina doesn't have a mortgage industry, and thus buying a pallet of bricks each time you get a paycheck is an effective way to pay for your home in installments. (Bricks aren't fully monetized, in that I don't think people buy bricks and then sell them later, so people only use this method of saving when they actually have something they want to use the bricks for.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As you can imagine, there are challenges that come with saving in wads of $100 bills or stacks of bricks. For one thing, they take up a lot of space. Worse, your life savings are also at constant risk of theft, damage, and fire. If something does happen, the bills are not insured or protected by any institution; they’re just gone. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a result, Argentinians are interested in alternatives for storing their money, especially those that are both out of the clutches of their government and safer than storing piles of cash at home.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crypto is starting to make it easier for Argentinians to save&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the US, critics often make fun of crypto enthusiasts by pointing out that if you store your crypto on a hardware wallet and then lose the disk or the password, you're hosed. They scoff at crypto’s volatility and difficult user experience. They rightfully point out that most Americans won't make this tradeoff when institutions like banks can store the money for them securely, and without risk of losing the money. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The tradeoffs are very different in Argentina: when your alternative is storing boxes of money in the attic or under your mattress, an unobtrusive hardware wallet sounds like a pretty good idea. Instead of carrying around suitcases of cash when you want to buy a house, you can just carry a USB stick with your private key to complete the transaction. When reflecting on crypto’s volatility, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://restofworld.org/2022/why-crypto-crash-different-latin-america&quot;&gt;common sentiment&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;I would rather have a digital asset whose price goes up and down than a currency whose only real trend is down.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When most people think of crypto, they tend to think of bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). However, these are not ideal savings instruments because they are highly volatile and the transaction fees remain expensive. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a result, BTC and ETH are not so common for daily use in Argentina. Stablecoins such as USD-T, USD-C, and TRON are a more popular solution because they are pegged to a more stable currency (usually, USD).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Notably, the stablecoins popular for savings are also much more centralized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/video/tether-blocks-160-million-usdt-152718550.html#:~:text=Because%20Tether%20is%20a%20centralized,listing%20them%20on%20the%20blacklist.&quot;&gt;The Tether Foundation (which issues USD-T) has blocked transactions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptonews.com/news/risks-of-centralized-stablecoins-materialize-as-100k-usdc-fr-7067.htm&quot;&gt;so has the Centre consortium (which issues USD-C)&lt;/a&gt;. While TRON is technically not centralized, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-decentralized-are-decentralized-networks#:~:text=Consequently%2C%20co%2Dfounder%20Chen%20(,re%2Delected%20every%20six%20hours.&quot;&gt;its cofounder has said that its architecture is not as decentralized as other blockchains’&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;They are attractive to Argentinians because they are not under the control of the government, not because they are decentralized and truly permissionless.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remote work is a way to decouple from the local economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the same time that crypto is changing how people use money, remote work is becoming increasingly common for Argentinians, because it allows them to earn in other currencies besides the peso. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Remote workers sometimes set up bank accounts abroad so they don't have to bring them back into Argentina (and thus under the watchful eye of the government). They hold funds in places like Payoneer, PayPal, Mercury, or Estonian and US bank accounts, and withdraw just enough in Argentina to pay for the day-to-day expenses. Sometimes these are set up legally, and sometimes they are not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;USD and EUR have historically been the most popular currencies for remote work, in part because most of the remote jobs come from the US or Europe, and in part because those currencies are quite stable and accepted worldwide. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, overseas accounts remain out of reach for many people — setting up bank accounts abroad generally requires traveling there, which is expensive and time-consuming. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Crypto is starting to help a small but growing number of remote workers in Argentina. Crypto allows them to move their money around from within Argentina, rather than having to use an intermediary in another country. This can save them trips to Estonia, the US, or wherever they would’ve had to open their bank accounts. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If done covertly, it can also allow them to avoid Argentinian taxes (though this also requires coordination with their employer, which many employers are not willing to do, because it increases their liability). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Argentinians who use crypto are increasingly untethered from the local Argentinian economy and increasingly plugged into the global cloud economy. Crypto is providing new solutions to problems that Argentina has faced for generations, and many Argentinians are excited about its potential to make it easier and safer to make, use, and store money.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crypto is more practical than cash for many transactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Distrust of the formal financial system is part of everyday life in Argentina. On every payday, the first stop many Argentinians make is to the cuevas (the illegal money exchanges), where they can swap their ARS for USD. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This solves one problem — they’re no longer holding onto the hot potato that is the Argentine peso — but creates many other problems.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For one, stacks of bills are difficult to transport. This increases the energy cost necessary for any transaction. For example, an American friend of mine considered buying an apartment in Buenos Aires many years ago, but he balked when he realized he’d have to stuff a suitcase with $100 bills and fly them to Argentina in order to meet the seller’s expectations. He decided it was not worth the hassle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It’s also dangerous to transport physical bills. Criminals know that people often carry cash, which makes muggings more attractive in Argentina compared to countries where most transactions are done on credit cards. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The cuevas themselves have serious security problems, too — they have to transport sometimes millions of dollars in USD to and from their offices every day, so they end up having to move the location of their offices often so that other criminals don’t catch wind of where their couriers will be going in and out of their operation. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Crypto is starting to help Argentinians deal with these problems. When making a big purchase, like a house, you can just carry a USB stick with your private key to complete the transaction, instead of having to transport suitcases full of cash. Like with cash, the government doesn't have to be the wiser that the crypto transaction occurred, enabling buyers and sellers to avoid capital controls and taxes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;From talking to locals, it sounds like this is still rare, in part because both sides of the transaction have to agree to doing it in crypto. It also requires a high level of technical comfort, user experience is poor, and volatility is high. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, Argentinians have a lot of experience finding gaps in complex systems and then taking advantage of them fully, so I expect adoption to grow rapidly as word spreads that this is possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another problem with cash is it may require a trusted third party that both the buyer and seller are comfortable with to hold the funds in escrow. Because many of these transactions are under the table, participants have little recourse if things go wrong, so it’s crucial that the third party is trustworthy. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Smart contracts, programmed on the blockchain, have the potential to take out this third party and instead allow the buyer and seller to use a neutral contract that holds funds in escrow until both sides have agreed the transaction is complete. I’ve yet to hear of an Argentinian who’s done this, but it’s a big opportunity to solve a major problem in the ecosystem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crypto has also become central to the cuevas’ business&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;The cuevas I spoke to said that crypto has made it much safer and cheaper to transfer large sums of money on the backend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One key use case is to evade the government’s capital controls so that they can bring money in and out of Argentina. The government has made it impossible to extract USD from ATMs (yes, even if you're an American with an American bank account denominated in USD), so historically a major way that USD bills entered the country was through the crossing the physical border between Argentina and Uruguay. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Uruguay is Argentina’s much more economically free neighbor, and it doesn't have restrictions on USD, so there has been a large flow of dollars across the river between the two countries. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, this was expensive and risky, since the cuevas had to smuggle large quantities of physical cash across the wide Rio de la Plata river. Crypto, especially USD-C and USD-T, has made it much easier to move that money around: now, the cuevas can move dollars in and out of the country from their highrise offices in Buenos Aires, rather than having to get onto a boat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another use is to pay someone in USD (usually in a stablecoin) in exchange for physical pesos. This is especially true for the &quot;wholesalers&quot; called &quot;cuevas mayoristas,&quot; who are responsible for delivering large amounts of cash to smaller retail cuevas. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Historically, these wholesalers have had motorcycle couriers who biked all around the city delivering stacks of pesos or dollars to smaller cuevas around town. These couriers wear custom-made vests tucked under their coats that are specially designed to carry the maximum number of bills without looking visibly bulky, to avoid the attention of law enforcement and criminals who might realize that a juicy payday is tucked into every nook and cranny around their chest and legs. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Crypto has helped reduce this risk by giving the cuevas a way to move USD around without having to physically transport it on humans, who are prone to getting robbed. These couriers are still an important part of the business because Argentina is mostly a cash economy and thus people still need their physical pesos, but crypto has reduced the risk of loss dramatically by reducing the number of dollars they need to carry alongside the pesos.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most Argentinians interact with crypto through intermediaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;From talking to several cuevas and to my Argentinian friends, it sounds like it’s still uncommon for a typical person to use crypto to move money around directly. More likely, they go to a cueva and the cueva does the transaction for them, and the person doesn’t realize that the cueva was using crypto behind the scenes to do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I find this fascinating because one of the big assumptions of crypto proponents was that when crypto is adopted widely, everyone will control their own wallets and addresses. But in Argentina right now, it’s more common for consumers to interact with a centralized business that itself depends on the decentralization of crypto to exist, rather than for the consumers to interact with the blockchain directly. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another way to look at it is that the cuevas’ use of crypto on the backend enables people to more easily access dollars and other assets, even if they aren't interacting with crypto directly themselves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In practice, this may end up having similar effects as the world where every person has their own hardware wallet because if the centralized cueva they depend on misbehaves or goes under, the decentralization of the blockchain that the cueva uses allows the end customer to just move over to another centralized service that is layered on top of the blockchain. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But I could also see it working similarly to how we access the internet today. Technically, the internet is a decentralized service that you can connect to without going through an intermediary like Facebook or Google, but in practice almost everyone goes through those giants to access the web, and they layer lots of other centralized services on top that make it very difficult to eject from their ecosystem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even cuevas have picked convenience over decentralization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;It’s also fascinating to see the tools people and cuevas use to interact with crypto. Every cueva manager I met said that they and their customers prefer TRON over BTC or ETH or other more well-known cryptocurrencies, primarily because the transaction fees are so much lower. They said their customers don’t send them crypto that often, but when they do it’s usually TRON from a Binance wallet. They were surprised when my friend tried to send them ETH directly from his wallet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The fact that they use TRON and Binance was notable, because both of these are centralized services without the best reputations. TRON’s design is technically decentralized, but its cofounder has &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-decentralized-are-decentralized-networks&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; it as &quot;centralized&quot; because it depends on such a small number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/what-is-tron-trx-and-how-does-it-work-a-beginners-guide&quot;&gt;super representatives&lt;/a&gt;, who are responsible for keeping track of the transaction history in the TRON ecosystem to validate transactions. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Binance, a crypto exchange, is completely centralized, meaning that any balances that anyone has with Binance are stored on a central database that Binance controls, rather than on a permissionless blockchain. This means that Binance can freeze accounts if it chooses to, which sounds an awful lot like the situation the Argentine banking system was in during the 2001 &quot;corralito,&quot; which left millions of Argentinians without access to their savings for nearly a year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This ambivalence for decentralized cryptocurrencies isn’t limited to consumers. Of all the cuevas I spoke with, only one actually manages their own keys. Every other cueva I know uses Binance as their primary wallet for crypto, both for day-to-day transfers and for holding their reserves. Many of them are holding hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in these reserves, which could easily get shut down at any time since what they’re doing is explicitly illegal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is striking because it doesn't match up with the story that many crypto maximalists push about decentralization. Enthusiasts talk all about how important decentralization is, and given their unfortunate financial history, Argentinians more than most should appreciate those benefits. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And yet, there they are, holding their reserves in a centralized app that could get shut down tomorrow, theoretically just as easily as the banks were during the 2001 corralito.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The way I explain this to myself, it seems that the key characteristic that draws Argentinians to these relatively centralized cryptocurrencies is that the government doesn't control them, rather than being completely decentralized in a way that no one controls them. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To me, this is evidence that they are not bought into the philosophy behind crypto, but rather the utility of crypto. And insofar that the utility and philosophy are discordant, the more you'll find that the theories of crypto enthusiasts don't match reality. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The revealed preference of these cuevas is that they care more about convenience than absolute decentralization. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What makes this so odd is that a lower-risk alternative is fairly straightforward and only slightly more expensive — instead of using TRON through Binance, they could use TRON directly, which would only cost them $0.50 USD per transaction. This might not make sense for individuals moving small amounts of money around, but the cuevas are often storing hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in reserves in Binance, and so fifty cents on top of transactions of that scale is virtually nothing. It seems like a worthwhile insurance policy to avoid having your money in a centralized institution that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://beincrypto.com/binance-ceo-fights-back-after-craig-wright-claims-the-exchange-is-about-to-implode/&quot;&gt;widely distrusted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Unless I'm missing something, cuevas’ use of Binance seems very short-sighted, especially to store their reserves. My best guess of what’s going on is that they still haven’t learned all of the gotchas involved with crypto, simply because it’s so early. Additionally, the business owners often depend on younger employees to handle &quot;the crypto stuff.&quot; An Argentinian friend of mine jokes that when you ask a cueva to do a crypto transaction, they call to the back of the office and bring out their &quot;crypto guy,&quot; who’s usually like a 17-year-old kid with a smartphone who knows the basics of the Binance app. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm curious to see what'll happen if Binance implodes—will the cuevas lose big, and if so, what will they learn? I could see it going one of two ways. On one hand, it might spook them away from crypto in general. On the other hand, it might make them appreciate decentralization more, and teach them that they weren't taking advantage of enough of crypto's unique properties.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Crypto has quietly transformed the way many Argentinians move money and access the global economy. The volume of transactions going through crypto is &lt;a href=&quot;https://complyadvantage.com/insights/cryptocurrency-transaction-volumes-grow-567-as-focus-turns-to-defi/&quot;&gt;growing rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s increasingly out of the government’s control. However, the way that has played out is quite different from what many crypto enthusiasts have imagined.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Decentralization is a worthy goal, but in practice it seems that most Argentinians don’t care that much about it, at least not in the way purists talk about it. They’re more worried about whether the government can get their hands on their money; as long as the answer is &quot;no&quot;, they don’t seem to care much about who else has control over it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At first, I was surprised to see so many Argentinians using centralized tools to access crypto. But upon reflection, I realized this is exactly what we should expect from human psychology: people implicitly value convenience over preparing for long-tail risks — like the risk of a stablecoin becoming unstable, or an exchange collapsing or being seized by the government — and centralization makes it easier to provide that convenience. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It’s not until something goes terribly wrong that we start to invest in protecting ourselves from the downside. And plenty has already gone wrong in Argentina’s traditional financial system. So if Argentinians aren’t rushing to embrace decentralized currencies, that says a lot about what we should expect from the rest of the world.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Pirate crews developed a surprisingly similar approach to compensation in the 17th century. Just like many startups, they also balanced equity incentives with other mechanisms that would be familiar to a startup employee today, such as bonuses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These surprising similarities offer an interesting frame through which we can reflect on why startup equity and bonuses are structured the way they are. We can learn a lot about the theory of compensation in modern companies by looking at how pirates designed incentives to organize and motivate their work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;It’s called &quot;venture&quot; capital for a reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Pirates offered their crew members equal shares of their loot, similar to how many startups offer employees equity in the business. In this way, 17th-century pirates and modern-day startups are more similar to each other than to law-abiding ships or established companies, the most common alternative employment options in their respective eras.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the Golden Age of Piracy (late 1600s-early 1700s), it was incredibly rare for law-abiding workers to own a share of a business. Piracy offered one of the few avenues for a normal person to have a chance for great riches and autonomy over their work. Merchant ships and royal navies were the two main alternatives to piracy for employment for sailors, neither of which had any sort of equity-based compensation. They paid flat wages on a per-voyage basis, which meant that no sailors got rich from working on a merchant or navy ship.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This has persisted through the centuries. To this day, employee ownership still isn’t the norm outside of startups. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211210130620/https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;22% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who work for a for-profit company report that they own any shares of stock in the company. Meanwhile, it’s common practice for a startup to give equity, and it’s a crucial part of the compensation package to attract talent. Many potential employees won’t even consider working for an early startup that doesn’t offer equity. For example, multiple people in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28561054&quot;&gt;this Hacker News thread&lt;/a&gt; state that they wouldn’t accept a job from an employer like Mailchimp that doesn’t offer equity compensation, and a former Mailchimp employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/save/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28561738&quot;&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; lack of equity as the &quot;largest factor&quot; in their move.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The crucial similarity between startups and pirates—which they don’t share with most modern companies or with 17th-century merchant ships—is that the teammates themselves are essentially acting as investors, rather than just as employees. Pirates had no base wage and only made money if they captured another ship; meanwhile, early startup employees generally take a pay cut in the short term in return for a stake in the company. In both cases, the teammates are essentially investing their own time into the company at a discount in exchange for potential upside in the future value they are part of creating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By contrast, merchant ships and the navy paid low but steady wages. The average law-abiding sailor’s wage was &quot;about $4,000 to $8,800 in current U.S. dollars,&quot; according to Peter T. Leeson. Although these wages were low, it was much less risky than getting paid purely based on a &quot;you eat what you kill&quot; policy. Similarly, many modern workers choose to work for a big company that pays a steady salary instead of a startup where their equity might be worth millions—or might be worthless—down the line.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although pirates and startup employees both venture into uncharted waters, the risks that pirates faced were of course far greater than anything most startup employees face today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In startups, the biggest risk is that your equity might be worthless. A pirate might die, lose a limb, or go to prison for life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Despite these differences, the essential structure of the risk-reward tradeoff that sailors faced when considering piracy was similar to the choice that modern workers face when deciding between a startup or an established company. The potential for massive upside attracts ambitious, risk-tolerant people to startups today similar to how it attracted them to pirate ships in the 17th century. Luckily, these days there are better employment alternatives than the merchant marine, the royal navy, and piracy!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Treasure for me but not for thee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the key challenges that both startups and pirate ships face is that it’s difficult to control (or even measure) how productive a particular teammate is day by day. When management can’t guarantee that you’ll operate for the benefit of the team’s broader goals, they need to design incentives so that you’ll do what’s right for the team even when no one is watching.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That said, the reason it’s difficult to control or measure a startup employee’s productivity is different from why it’s difficult to do so for a pirate. In a tech company, most employees are doing &quot;knowledge work&quot;. Much of the hard work happens inside of someone’s head, where you can’t see it. When a knowledge worker produces output, it can be almost as much effort to verify that it was done well as it was to produce it in the first place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Pirate ships have a different challenge with maintaining discipline and quality control: a collective action problem. The most crucial moments that defined a pirate ship’s success were when they attacked another ship to capture their treasure. These are also one of the most dangerous moments, because there is physical violence involved. If you’re a pirate, you want to see your crew successfully capture a merchant ship because it’ll make you rich, but you also want to avoid violence because… well, you might die before you get to see any of that treasure. The resulting incentive is to hold back and let your comrades board the victim ship before you, so that you can get the benefits without the costs. However if all of the pirates do that, the raid is much more likely to fail.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The way pirates solved this problem was similar to how startup compensation works today—although luckily the stakes aren’t so high in a modern Delaware C-corp. Before each journey, pirates would create a written constitution that laid out the base compensation for each crew member, as well as bonuses for especially brave actions. Alexander Exquemelin, a 17th century French pirate surgeon who wrote &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The History of the Buccaneers of America&lt;/span&gt;, described one excerpt of the articles of agreement that governed his ship: &quot;For the loss of a right arm, 600 pieces of eight… for a left arm 500 pieces of eight... If a man lost the use of an arm, he would get as much as if it had been cut off, and a severe internal injury which meant the victim had to have a pipe inserted in his body would receive 500 pieces of eight […] in recompense.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3RWTJ6N&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Invisible Hook&lt;/a&gt;, Peter T. Leesen describes, &quot;To further encourage full effort, pirate articles contained incentive provisions that paid bonuses to crew members who displayed exceptional courage in battle, were the first to spot potential targets, and so forth, out of the common purse… According to section VIII of Ned Low’s crew’s articles, &quot;He that sees a sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her.&quot; These incentive provisions must have worked well since, as Johnson noted, &quot;It must be observed, they [pirates] keep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who first espies a Sail, if she proves a Prize, is entitled the best Pair of Pistols on board, over and above his Dividend.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The typical startup compensation structure has many similarities with that of a pirate ship, though luckily startup employees are generally not risking life or limb when they join a high-growth company. When an employee has had an exceptional year and goes above and beyond their standard duties, their manager will often award them a cash or stock bonus, significantly increasing their overall compensation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Bonuses are important to both startup and pirate compensation structures, because they counteract the &quot;rising tides lift all boats&quot; effect that company equity and equally splitting booty both create. While equity and equal shares of booty align individuals with the goals of the overall team, they also allow for free-riders to benefit from the work of others without having to do anything on their own, once they’ve joined the team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The motivational effect of bonuses shows up in the data too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/11-041.pdf&quot;&gt;An analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the Yale School of Management studied how sales teams respond to bonus-based compensations plan, and they found that &quot;bonuses enhance productivity [and] overachievement commissions help sustain the high productivity of the best performers even after attaining quotas&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Bonuses also disaggregate individual impact over time, compared to equity whose value is determined by the aggregate impact of the whole team. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/executive-bonuses-might-work-better-you-think&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; from the Stanford Graduate School of Business illustrates this effect. The researchers studied data between 2006-2017 for over 1,400 public companies. &quot;They found that tying bonus-related performance to non-bottom-line financials largely helped address issues related to timing: that is, the time lag between when an executive makes an investment in the business’s future and when that investment pays off. If there’s a timing mismatch, boards will sometimes disregard costs of certain investments when calculating bonuses — as a way to encourage investments in projects worth pursuing, especially the kind that are designed to promote long-term growth.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Whether it’s for exceeding a KPI or being the first to board a merchant ship, performance-based bonuses incentivize team members to carry their weight and take initiative rather than depending on the enthusiasm or past successes of their coworkers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/55b89b1e-c76c-4bd4-9031-06b8131b28e3/bba24d48-6abc-4a8b-bd87-89f3cf5a9276.jpg&quot; width=&quot;121&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Pirates are a fascinating comparison point for modern startups. If you look closely at how pirates worked together, it’s easy to recognize organizational structures that are alive and well in modern startups.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although the day-to-day work of a sea bandit couldn’t be more different than that of a frontend engineer at a SaaS startup, the risk-reward tradeoff is very similar. Putting that tradeoff in visceral terms can be a fun way to make it more concrete and intuitive when venturing into uncharted waters.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I wrote a Buenos Aires guide with recommendations and tips for a group of friends I was traveling with in December 2021, and I figured it might be useful to other people too. I adore Buenos Aires and spend about a month each year there, so I'm always thrilled to hear when friends are going to spend time in the city, and I love sharing what I know about the place with newcomers. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Buenos Aires is an underrated city. My friends are often surprised to hear that it's similar to Barcelona, and that several neighborhoods could have come straight out of Paris, if it weren't for the Spanish signs on the shops. Its pasta, pizza, and gelato rival that of any Italian city — people don't realize that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Argentines&quot;&gt;over 60%&lt;/a&gt; of Argentines have some Italian ancestry, and they kept Italian food traditions alive when they came over to the New World. (Personally, I think Argentinian gelato is even better than Italian gelato...)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Buenos Aires is also very cheap. Of all the places I've been, BsAs has the highest ratio of quality of life to cost of living. A 10-minute taxi ride will cost you 50¢, and a spacious AirBNB in the nicest neighborhoods in the city can cost as little as $20 USD per night. The most expensive meal I've ever had in Argentina came out to $40 USD, and that was at one of the fanciest restaurants in the entire country.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I could gush about Argentina endlessly, but I'll stop there and just point you to the guide I wrote: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder; border-bottom: 2px solid rgba(54, 125, 162, 0.4) !important&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devonz.notion.site/PUBLIC-Buenos-Aires-recommendations-b2b23d7a2d9746b7974e11b09ed81aec&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 24px;&quot;&gt;Buenos Aires guide&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The guide is focused on practical details like COVID tests, how to exchange money, restaurants, and that sort of thing. There are so many interesting things to share about Argentina's culture, monetary system, urban planning, history, and beyond, but those will come in separate posts in the future. In the meantime, you might find &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Adevonzuegel%20argentina&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top&quot;&gt;some of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Adevonzuegel%20buenos%20aires&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Adevonzuegel%20argentinian&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top&quot;&gt;tidbits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Adevonzuegel%20bsas&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I hope you have an amazing time while you're in Argentina!&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I just spent a week in Panamá City, and figured I'd share my observations in case they're useful to anyone else interested in similar questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The purpose of the trip was to research locations for a gene therapy/stem cell clinic that my friend is planning to start. I also explored a few of Panamá's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as part of my ongoing research about &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonzuegel.com/tag/startup-cities&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;startup cities&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to learn about the opportunities they offer for businesses like my friend's clinic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The fact that this was a goal-oriented trip actually made it even more fun. I recommend this as a way to organize your travels. For me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1489644177084149766&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;travel is most satisfying when I have a concrete goal&lt;/a&gt;—in this case, &quot;where's the best place to open a gene therapy clinic in Central America?&quot;—because it forces you to actually learn about the place rather than take whatever path just happens to be pre-paved for tourists. You bump up against real constraints in the real world, rather than interacting with some manicured narrative of what the place is about. Best yet, you learn about what its future might be, not just the past.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another reason I was excited to visit Panamá was that I lived in a tiny rural village called El Águila in 2010 as part of a high school exchange program. I hadn't been back in 12 years, so I was excited to reconnect with my host family. It was fascinating and invigorating to see how the country had changed!&lt;div style=&quot;display: none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/55d7a16e-a420-4f9f-a109-5d2ba4938335/3d5dafd3-5936-4f59-a57f-20a037ec2824.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But I'm getting ahead of myself. I've broken down my field notes into three sections:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stem cells, biotech, &amp; regulation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;SEZs &amp; new city developments&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panamanian urbanism, economic development, &amp; general observations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I. Stem cells, biotech, &amp; regulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;We learned some conflicting information about the legal status of commercial stem cell treatments in Panamá, and I'm still trying to sort it out. If you know a doctor or lawyer who specializes in this area, &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonzuegel.com/contact&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;I'd love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before the trip, I did some online sleuthing to get some background on the issue. Highlights:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panama passed a law in 2004 making embryonic stem cell work illegal, which at the same time opened the door to legally working with adult stem cells in ways not yet approved in the US.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr. Riordan at the Panama Stem Cell Institute has performed &quot;over 10,000 procedures&quot; using stem cells to treat autism and many other conditions since they opened in Panamá in 2006. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clippings.devonzuegel.com/stem-cell-therapy-for-autism-at-the-panama-stem-cell-institute&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Parents' Guide to Cord Blood&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;They sell commercial stem cell treatments (e.g. they charge $13,000-$18,000 for autism treatments) so they're not just doing clinical trials, which you're not supposed to charge for.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The article says that the clinic and lab are &quot;fully licensed by the national medical authorities and adhere to international standards&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The clinic registered a clinical trial for autism in 2014, which included 20 participants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The clinic was originally based in Costa Rica, but it moved to Panamá in 2006. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clippings.devonzuegel.com/stem-cell-institute-panama-cellmedicine-reviews-complaints-treatments-cost-vs-costa-rica&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Stem Cell Transplant Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;It appears that they moved because they were not allowed to perform treatments because &quot;efficacy and safety were uncertain&quot;, although they were &quot;allowed to store adult stem cells extracted from patients’ own fat tissue, bone marrow and donated umbilical cords&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stem cell treatments have since been approved by Costa Rica's government, and there are active clinics that offer these treatments to patients.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/is-stem-cell-therapy-legal-in-panama&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;BioXcellerator&lt;/a&gt; writes that &quot;not only is stem cell therapy legal in Panama, it is quickly becoming one of the global leaders in research of non-surgical therapeutic options for care.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My general understanding from that pre-travel prep was that commercialization of stem cells is legal in Panamá, and that it's a small but growing industry. However, when I got boots on the ground, I began to hear different things...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Firstly, there are very few stem cell clinics here. From talking to several medical professionals, I was only able to learn about two in the entire country: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neilriordan.com/stem-cell-institute/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Stem Cell Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cordondevida.net/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Cordon de Vida&lt;/a&gt;. This was surprising to me, since some uses of stem cells have been legal in the country since 2004 (as described above) and I'd expect droves of doctors to take advantage of the opportunity to serve medical tourists who can't get these treatments in the US.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I met with a Panamanian orthopedic surgeon who's considering starting a stem cell clinic for medical tourism. He didn't seem terribly concerned about the legal status, though he hadn't opened the clinic yet so he may not be aware of the hurdles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I met with &quot;the only stem cell researcher in Panamá&quot; to understand her perspective on the technology's legal status.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;She's opposed to commercialization of stem cells in Panamá for anything that (a) doesn't have lots of clinical trials first and (b) hasn't already gone through approvals through the Panamanian FDA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;She considers it illegal to sell stem cell treatments in Panamá, since they don't meet either of those criteria.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, it's not really enforced so there are several commercial stem cell clinics that have popped up charging for &quot;clinical trials&quot;, which you're not supposed to do&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;She's extremely excited about the future of stem cells, but just thinks it's too early to be offering them in a commercial setting. She believes that the technology is still at the stage where it's only ethical to use it in clinical trials, in which the patients do not pay for the treatment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;She hopes that Panamá becomes a center for medical tourism because it is on the cutting edge but not because it's a haven for people escaping the US FDA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Misc/related thoughts:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've heard there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS?end=2019&amp;locations=PA-JP-US-MX-CR-GB-BS&amp;start=1960&amp;view=chart&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;shortage of medical professionals in Panamá&lt;/a&gt;, which could be a barrier to becoming a medical tourism hub. Additionally, Panamanian labor law states that &quot;only 10% of your business workforce can be filled by foreign workers&quot;, which means the shortage can't be solved by simply importing talent from elsewhere.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stem cell treatments are legal in Costa Rica and Colombia, so I'm planning a trip to those countries as well to dig into similar questions. If you know anyone I should speak to while I'm there, please let me know. I'm also open to other suggestions for places that welcome stem cell treatments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My overall takeaway was that you could probably start a commercial clinic and possibly operate without problems for years, but you may get shut down or fined at some point in the future by the government. If anyone knows more details about this or can correct me, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonzuegel.com/contact&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;II. Special Economic Zones &amp; new city developments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;I visited three of Panamá's SEZs. I also met with a lawyer who specializes in Panamanian SEZs, which gave me a very helpful bird's eye view of how the legal frameworks that support the SEZs work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Each SEZ in Panamá is different, but the general similarity is that they all provide benefits to their tenants such as:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;higher quality infrastructure than what's typically found outside of the zone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;a cluster of talent that is concentrated in a single focal point&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;special pre-built facilities (e.g. laboratories or warehouses)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;tax exemptions on tariffs, remittances, VAT, local direct taxes on capital, corporate income tax&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;special immigration and labor incentives (e.g. ability to expedite visas)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I visited three SEZs: Ciudad del Saber, Panamá Pacífico, and Porta Norte. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Project #1 – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ciudaddelsaber.org/en/what-is-city-of-knowledge/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ciudad del&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciudaddelsaber.org/en/what-is-city-of-knowledge/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Saber&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;City of Knowledge&quot; in English)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;business model: non-profit foundation whose revenue comes from renting out facilities to businesses/institutions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;it's been self-sufficient for many years now, though it started with a land grant from the government in 1998; took a credit line with a local bank for first 10 years + the EU gave matching funds → CDS paid all of this off by year 7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;120 hectares / 300 acres, 200 buildings (mostly built for the former Clayton US military base and now adapted to new uses)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;the idea was to &quot;exchange soldiers for professors, bullets for books&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;rents out some housing (~100 houses I think), but it's not a central focus&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;focus on housing research, innovation, and NGOs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;businesses need to apply, meet a bunch of criteria, and get approved by CDS' board of directors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;tenants in CDS needs to support &quot;innovation&quot; in some way — they won't accept purely commercial operations, but they'll accept businesses that have a research component&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;the board only meets 4x per year, so it takes some time to get established in CDS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;organizations based in CDS include:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;stem cell manufacturer MediStem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;the Red Cross&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;University of South Florida has a medical research lab&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;e.g. Dell wanted to put a call center at CDS, but CDS said &quot;no&quot; because it didn't have an innovation component and they established elsewhere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;CDS is considering hiring a liaison to help medtech companies within the zone to interact with Panamá's Ministry of Health, though that role doesn't yet exist&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

To me they were an odd patchwork rather than something designed with an overarching vision in mind, though I suppose that's true of most things. Each of them has a complex set of constraints and rights that overlap with each other in unintuitive ways. This is my rough understanding of how they fit together, though please note that there is a lot more complexity to exactly how they work:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col%C3%B3n_Free_Trade_Zone&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;1948 law&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Colón Free Zone&lt;/span&gt;. It provides tax incentives to entrepreneurs, and it was the first Free Trade Zone in the western hemisphere. I've heard it's falling apart and no longer considered cutting edge, but it was trailblazing in its time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.panama.justia.com/federales/decretos-leyes/6-de-1998-feb-12-1998.pdf&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;1998 law&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ciudad del Saber&lt;/span&gt; which endowed a non-profit foundation with land. The non-profit rents facilities to &quot;innovative&quot; businesses, research institutions, and NGOs and is required to reinvest any profits back into the infrastructure of the zone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.app.gob.pa/files/uxldilhvnb8vjkkxcbyf/a76e3a.pdf&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;2004 law&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Panamá Pacífico&lt;/span&gt;, which gave a private developer the right to buy up large swathes of land at a fixed price over the course of 40 years as it develops a warehouse area, a business park, and a residential area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://logistics.gatech.pa/bundles/docs/ley32_zf_en.pdf&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;2011 law&lt;/a&gt; allowed developers to apply to make their property a &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Free Trade Zone&lt;/span&gt;, regardless of where it is in the country. Before this law, if you wanted to start an FTZ, you had to get special legislation passed to get that status (e.g. the laws that enabled Colón and Panamá Pacífico). Now, it's just an application process (albeit a long and somewhat nondeterministic one, to my understanding).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The land for the proposed FTZ must be at least 2 hectares, and it must be enclosed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://logistics.gatech.pa/en/assets/special-economic-zones/free-zones&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;20 FTZs&lt;/a&gt; in Panamá.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is the type of FTZ that Porta Norte is applying to become.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;High level takeaways:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panamá has a unique situation that it has large swathes of land near the city. That land had previously been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_United_States_military_installations_in_Panama&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;dozens of American military bases&lt;/a&gt; from when the US owned Panamá Canal. This gave the Panamanian government prime real estate to use for the development of SEZs. By contrast, most developments of that scale have to happen in farther off parts of a country, because the land closest to population centers has generally been consumed already.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Having &quot;innovation zones&quot; that are specially decreed by the government to have special privileges seems to make them inflexible in what they're able to do, and as a result they end up being &quot;overfit&quot; to the needs of that time and in turn become obsolete quickly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ongoing decay of Colón Free Zone seems to be an example of this. From afar, it seems to be an issue of being bound by rules that weren't flexible enough to adjust with the times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although they both appear to be thriving, Panamá Pacifico and City of Knowledge gave me a sense of sterility and over-prescribed order that makes me worry that they may be inflexible in the future as the world changes around them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I got to see it up close and personal, because I reconnected with my host brother, Sami, and he has transformed his life since I saw him last. Seeing the progress they've made was one of the happiest experiences I've ever had. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;El Águila (the rural village where I lived in 2010) didn't have a paved road when I lived there. Since then, they've built a road that connects it to the rest of the country. While it used to take 4 hours to get to Panamá City from El Águila, it now takes 2-2.5 hours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I lived there, El Águila didn't have running water, glass for windows, or electricity. Now they have all of those things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;My host brother is now a lab technician at a biology research institute. He started out as a construction worker when he moved to Panamá City, but he loved biology, so he decided to do extra training on the side to learn how to work in a lab. He now works at Panamá's premier tropical diseases institute, Instituto Gorgas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Between 2010 and 2019, Panamanians' income more than doubled, as measured by PPP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/updates/purchasing-power-parity-ppp&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Purchasing Power Parity&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2010, Panamá's PPP was almost $15,000.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2019, Panamá's PPP was almost $33,000.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2020, Panamá's PPP sadly plummeted to $27,000 (I assume due to the pandemic), but hopefully they'll bounce back when the 2021 numbers come in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of my Panamanian friends recently went to the passport office, which gives people in line a different colored slip depending on whether they are renewing their passport vs getting a passport for the first time. When he looked around, almost everyone there was getting their passport for the first time. He saw this as a great sign that more and more Panamanians are getting rich enough to travel abroad for the first time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Also if you're into Miami-style modern high-rises, you'll definitely find something pretty comfortable. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Casco Viejo is a beautiful old town. It's similar to Old San Juan in Puerto Rico if you're familiar with it, though at night it feels more unsafe and it's smaller and thus closer to slums.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revistapanorama.com/la-cinta-costera-el-auhubau-que-une-a-la-ciudad/&quot;&gt;La Cinta Costera&lt;/a&gt;, the park that runs along the waterfront, is really lovely. Walking along the coastline at dusk is one of my favorite memories of Panamá City.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;It reminded me of South Pointe Park in Miami Beach, except with Brickell as a backdrop rather than South Beach's art deco buildings. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;There's a lively &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/AZAKFnhpSDwjm4Es9&quot;&gt;outdoor food court area&lt;/a&gt; that reminded me of Singapore's hawker stalls. It's right on the marina, so you can savor your ceviche while watching the fishermen haul in the corvina its made out of.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the other parts of the city that I saw as much. I saw two types of neighborhoods primarily: (1) soulless high rises with huge setbacks, lacking trees (especially for what's needed in a place where the sun is so intense!), and separated by a sea of parking and traffic and (2) cramped, low-grade buildings packed in with informal slum housing made of tin and scraps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Comparisons to other cities you might be familiar with...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panamá City reminded me a lot of Singapore, except it's not as clean or safe and generally not as well done. Singapore's urbanism isn't really my style, but I see what it's going for, and Panamá is aiming for something similar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Latin American city I'm most familiar with Buenos Aires, and so I find it a useful comparison point. Buenos Aires certainly has serious problems too, but its nice areas a much larger than Panamá City's nice areas. It's surprising if you just look at the PPP for each country, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=PA-AR&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Panamá's PPP is 50% higher than Argentina's&lt;/a&gt;. It's a good reminder that wealth as measured by PPP is not perfectly correlated with all good things (though it's certainly correlated with a lot of good things!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even in the modern high rises, there were lots of haphazard details, e.g. I tripped over a step into a bathroom in fancy lawyer's that clearly didn't followed any building standards that would be typical in USA. This might be chalked up to my clumsiness though. 😉 There were also lots of surprisingly narrow hallways in miscellaneous places, which would definitely not be up to American fire codes but may be up to code here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 185px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 185px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 185px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/55d7a16e-a420-4f9f-a109-5d2ba4938335/240df4a9-5c84-44c9-8fb2-5db6876f275a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 185px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/55d7a16e-a420-4f9f-a109-5d2ba4938335/8242e8d7-7566-430d-b9b8-29ffec4723a7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 370px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Casco Viejo, the old part of Panamá City, is a beautiful neighborhood.

(And that was just the construction! The original proposal was made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Second-Avenue-Subway-take-so-long-to-be-built&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;100 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and an initial attempt at construction began in the 1970s.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the region around Porta Norte, there are tons of other developments occurring at the same time. Those seemed to be more traditional suburban communities, but still exciting to see the country build so much and develop.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Panamanians have a very global, outward-looking culture:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is much more Asian influence in Panamá than I expected. I saw a lot of Chinese immigrants when I was here 12 years ago, but they didn't seem very assimilated, at least not in the countryside where I was living. In Panamá City today, most high end restaurants you go to are some sort of Panamanian-Asian fusion. Both Sami (my host brother) and Henry (the founder of Porta Norte) said that they eat Chinese style foods often. My trip also happened to coincide with Chinese New Year, and there was a huge celebration that took over the entire neighborhood where I was staying.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the people I spoke with (which admittedly is not an unbiased sample, though I did speak with people from all sorts of professions and income levels), they are all very positive towards global trade.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panamá was effectively a US colony for many years, so I thought perhaps there would be negativity against Americans, but the people I spoke with generally love America and want closer ties with it both economically and culturally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Fun facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonians&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Zonians&lt;/a&gt; refers people associated with the Panama Canal Zone. The Zone was a political entity which existed between 1903 and the absorption of the Canal Zone into the Republic of Panama between 1979 and 1999. People born in the Zone received both Panamanian and American citizenship. John McCain is probably the most notable Zonian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Two routes were under consideration for the Panama Canal: Nicaragua &amp; Panamá. A major selling point in favor of Panama was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1489408206640197635&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;the flat arch of Santo Domingo Church&lt;/a&gt;. The centuries old arch is so structurally unsound that the builders knew Panama couldn't possibly have earthquakes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As always, if you know something you think I might not know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonzuegel.com/contact&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;give me a holler&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;div&gt;I hope these notes were helpful, or at least interesting, to you.

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Inflation hits some parts of the economy harder and faster than others. It's obvious once you say it, and yet the way pundits and academics talk about inflation glosses over this reality. As a result, most people who haven't had direct experience with high inflation have a flawed view of how it affects daily life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Popular use of the term &quot;inflation&quot; makes it sound like the inflation rate is a single indisputable number that you can plug into a formula to make decisions.&lt;/b&gt; A pen pal recently made the following (paraphrased) comment in an email to me:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-top: 0 !important; margin-bottom: 0 !important&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Inflation isn't &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;actually&lt;/span&gt; a problem, since all it's doing is changing the measuring stick. Businesses can just price it into what they charge, workers can just price it into their wage negotiations, and banks can just price it into the interest rates on their loans. &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Nominal prices go up, but on a relative basis, real prices are essentially the same.&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately it's not that simple. That model doesn't factor in information asymmetry, time delays, or structural differences between economic actors. It can take years for an inflation shock to propagate through the economy and reach a stable equilibrium, and it only does so after wreaking havoc on people's expectations about money and commerce.&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display: none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/9180a1a9-4589-45fa-b267-3b44d3d9ed40/521f704f-878f-492f-b18f-080ecd858d56.jpg&quot; width=&quot;98&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This unevenness creates surprising downstream effects that are difficult to price in. In turn, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;systemic uncertainty reduces people's willingness to make long-term investments&lt;/span&gt;. (For example, high-inflation Argentina has almost no mortgage industry.) This drawback in investment isn't predicted by the model that my friend had in mind, because the model doesn't take into account the uncertainty that inflation causes or its psychological impacts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So let's go beyond the abstract term &quot;inflation&quot; and look at what it actually means in the real world. Inflation describes the overall effect of many individual people responding to the opportunities and challenges they see day-to-day. It's a very reactive process—prices adjust upwards throughout the economy as a response to the adjustment of other prices around them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Each of these adjustments happens at a different interval, depending on how quickly the information flows and how much power the person has to react. When a baker notices that flour is more expensive than last month, he'll increase the prices on the menu to cover those costs. When a independent consultant notices that her landlord raised her rent this year, she'll start to charge her clients more to be able to pay her expenses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a result, prices adjust at different rates across an economy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Inflation is a much more staggered, uneven process than our models and metrics take into account&lt;/span&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infocampo.com.ar/cuales-fueron-los-alimentos-con-mayor-aumento-de-precios-en-abril/&quot;&gt;cheese in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; has gotten much more expensive in the past few years. One Argentine I know said that he can't believe that a kilogram of cheese costs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infobae.com/economia/2021/07/18/inflacion-y-precios-distorsionados-que-alimentos-ya-no-se-pueden-comprar-con-un-billete-de-1000-pesos/&quot;&gt;same as a kilogram of beef&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result he and his family have stopped buying cheese to grate on their pasta.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Current prices in the US illustrate the effect as well. The NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211231162236/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/opinion/inflation-economy-biden-inequality.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;prices have soared for physical products but have risen only modestly for services. The cost of gasoline is up 58% in the last year, while health insurance prices have fallen almost 4%. Meat prices are up 13%, dairy 1.6%. Boys’ apparel is up 8.4%, while girls’ apparel is down 0.4%.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a result, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;the inflation rate each person experiences is very personalized&lt;/span&gt;. It's hard to agree on what &quot;the inflation rate&quot; is, because it depends on what you need to buy. If you drive a lot, fuel inflation will impact you more. If you're vegetarian, meat inflation isn't going to hit your pocket book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Foreign exchange (FX) fluctuations also create weird distortions in the economy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;When your currency depreciates, imports suddenly become more expensive, while domestic products aren't affected much at first.&lt;/span&gt; There's a whole spectrum between these extremes that is affected in uneven ways. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Argentina#:~:text=The%20Argentine%20automotive%20industry%20is,cars%2C%20trucks%20and%20buses).&amp;text=The%20latter%20produce%20modern%20replicas%20of%20classic%20cars&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Argentina manufactures some cars locally&lt;/a&gt;, but those cars need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/FIT-FOR-FORD-FOCUS-ST-2_1600065066535.html?spm=a2700.pc_countrysearch.main07.3.5e685503Y2gxnU&quot;&gt;electronic control units&lt;/a&gt; that are not manufactured in Argentina. As a result, when a devaluation occurs, Argentine car prices grow more quickly than the price of beef but not as quickly as pure imports like laptops.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This uneven effect impacts income too, not just consumption. I've heard multiple Americans say that &quot;inflation is good for workers because it erodes debts&quot;, but they forget that &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;wages are generally the last thing to adjust&lt;/span&gt;. Employers are motivated to change prices more rapidly than wages, and salaries are usually negotiated on a quarterly or yearly basis. This means that households lose purchasing power when inflation occurs. This is especially difficult those who are living paycheck to paycheck. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Wage adjustments are not just slow but also uneven across the economy.&lt;/span&gt; For example:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A waiter might do okay when their tips are a percentage of prices, because as long as the restaurant's owner updates prices consistently (which they're very motivated to do), the tip-based wages will adjust accordingly. Their base pay will not adjust so quickly though, because the restaurant owner is unlikely to updated wages as fast as menu prices.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A retiree with a pension is in a really tough spot, because pensions are rarely (if ever?) indexed to inflation, so over time their income gets eroded to zero.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Architects are in a tough spot too. They usually charge large lump fees, so if they give you a quote at the beginning of the year and then inflation hits, the real value of the quote they gave you went way down by the time you actually pay for their services.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a general rule, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;inflation disproportionately harms people who can't easily adjust their income upwards. &lt;/span&gt;Fixed contracts and fixed incomes are especially vulnerable. Wages also don't automatically adjust—you generally need to advocate for yourself to get a raise—so if you lack negotiating skills in a high-inflation economy, you're at a significant disadvantage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One concrete example: I know a general contractor who was working on several houses in Argentina in 1989, a year when the peso saw &lt;a title=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/08/Argentinas-record-inflation-in-1989/1808631774800/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/08/Argentinas-record-inflation-in-1989/1808631774800/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;5,000% inflation&lt;/a&gt;. That year, he made the unpleasant discovery that his clients paid late much more often than usual. They always had excuses: &quot;Ah sorry, I forgot to pay before I went on vacation. I'll pay you when I'm back!&quot; When you're seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/08/Argentinas-record-inflation-in-1989/1808631774800/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;40% inflation per month&lt;/a&gt;, delaying payment by a week is effectively a 10% discount. Awfully convenient to be out of town the week you're supposed to pay! Ever since learning this lesson the hard way, the contractor has always denominated his prices in USD.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When you look at abstract models, it's easy to miss the realities on the ground. The theoretical concept that you can &quot;just price in inflation, what's the big deal!&quot; does not hold up to the reality of how inflation actually propagates through the economy. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The term &quot;inflation&quot; is useful shorthand, but it's important to remember that it's just that: a shorthand. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(169, 169, 169); font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;style&gt;.row hr {margin: 20px 0 20px 0 !important}   .post .post-content ol li {padding: 3px 0 3px 8px !important}  .post .post-content ul li {padding: 4px 0 !important}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I've long wanted a notes app with an optional chat style interface for append-only notes. The idea is that I'll use the simpler append-only interface while on the go, and then use full-featured interface to review, edit, and organize those notes when I'm back at my computer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I realized recently that a combination of Telegram + Logseq will do exactly what I want! I jot down notes in a Telegram channel, and when I return to my computer, I find them in a single Logseq note called &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt;. It's a dream. 🥰&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I figured this might be useful to others, so I wrote down the steps I took to set this up. To get a sense of what you're getting yourself into, here's a demo of how it will work in the end if you follow the directions:&lt;div style=&quot;display:none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0cfe47c2-3af9-45a5-81ce-5596bc55f258/af6e47f8-aa19-4f5d-8f3f-9184b0a8e09b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PV3UrhI.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Heads up, it takes several seconds for the message to show up in (a) your &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; page Logseq and (b) the &lt;code&gt;quick notes.md&lt;/code&gt; file that backs it in Dropbox. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/o2ILSpmtDFk&quot; style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25);&quot;&gt;Here's a video with a full res version of this demo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; --inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;What to expect from this tutorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Result:&lt;/span&gt; When you send a message to a particular Telegram channel, it will append the message to a file in Dropbox and will also show up in iCloud and in your Logseq notes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Requirements:&lt;/span&gt; You will need accounts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://telegram.org/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I also assume that you already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt; graph set up and stored in iCloud.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Link Telegram to Dropbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Create a new channel in Telegram. I called my channel &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note that a channel is not the same as a group!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Make sure you say &lt;code&gt;allow forwarding&lt;/code&gt;, as this will be a requirement for step 4.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Create a new applet in IFTTT, and select &lt;code&gt;Telegram&lt;/code&gt; as the Trigger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now you'll connect your channel to IFTTT. Click &lt;code&gt;connect new channels&lt;/code&gt;, which will direct you to a chat with the IFTTT bot in the Telegram app. Click the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; button at the bottom of the chat.&lt;div style=&quot;height: 6px&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;Follow the steps the IFTTT bot shares with you: (a) add the bot as an admin in your quick notes channel and then (b) forward a message from the quick notes channel to the bot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Go back to the IFTTT trigger screen and select &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;which channel?&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now you'll create the Then action. Select &lt;code&gt;Dropbox&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code&gt;Append to a text file&lt;/code&gt; action. Here are the values I put in the fields (below). This will append messages you send to your &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; channel to a file in your dropbox titled &lt;code&gt;Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 263px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 647px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;filename: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ChannelTitle}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;content: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;- {{PostText}}                    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  collapsed:: true                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    -                             &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;      date:: {{PostedAt}} ET      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;      telegram-link:: {{PostUrl}} &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dropbox folder path: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;telegram&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Save the applet. (Note that you have to click the &quot;update&quot; button twice... no, I don't know why IFTTT made the UI that way...)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before we move on, let's test to make sure it's working how you expect. Send yourself a message in the &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt;, and a few seconds later you should see it pop up at the bottom of &lt;code&gt;Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Link Dropbox to iCloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Change the extension of the file in Dropbox from &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the Then part of the IFTTT applet is agnostic to the extension, so this shouldn't break anything. (That said, I'd test this again to make sure it works as expected.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Create a symlink of &lt;code&gt;quick notes.md&lt;/code&gt; into wherever you have store your Logseq graph. Here's the command I used, as an example: &lt;code&gt;ln -s &quot;/Users/devonzuegel/Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.md&quot; &quot;/Users/devonzuegel/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/logseq-db/pages&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Search Logseq for your new &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; page. It should show up just like any other page, and when you edit it, you should see the changes reflected in the file in the Dropbox folder and in your iCloud folder.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Let's test it now! Send a message from Telegram to the &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; channel. After a few seconds, it should show up in Logseq in the &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; file!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Add support for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For some reason the Telegram trigger we set up in Step 1 doesn't support images, so we have to set up a second trigger to handle that. This is very similar to Step 1, with a few minor tweaks to handle the specifics of images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Create a new applet in IFTTT, and select &lt;code&gt;Telegram &gt; New photo in your channel&lt;/code&gt; as the Trigger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Connect your existing &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; channel to IFTTT (the &lt;code&gt;which channel?&lt;/code&gt; field).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Create the Then action. Select &lt;code&gt;Dropbox&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code&gt;Append to a text file&lt;/code&gt; action. Here are the values I put in the fields (below). This will append photos and their captions you send to your &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; channel to a file in your dropbox titled &lt;code&gt;Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 263px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 647px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;filename: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ChannelTitle}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;content: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;- ![]({{PhotoUrl}}){:width 350}    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {{Caption}}                      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  collapsed:: true                 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    -                              &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;      date:: {{PostedAt}} ET       &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;      telegram-link:: {{PostUrl}}  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 263px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dropbox folder path: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 647px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;telegram&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Now try sending yourself an image, both with and without the caption!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Step 4: Customization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-grey-border--wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0cfe47c2-3af9-45a5-81ce-5596bc55f258/06b2174f-6d73-442d-91c7-16bb496aa9e9.png&quot; width=&quot;108px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Here's the icon for my &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; channel 🙂&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Time to nest!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One option is you can give your channel a cute icon. Or if you're boring, you can just leave it with the default.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You can also rename the channel if you want, but be careful because this might break the IFTTT connection. If you do so, make sure you also update the filename to match in the IFTTT &quot;Then append to a text file&quot; action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Caveats to keep in mind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Emoji:&lt;/span&gt; If you send emoji, they won't show up in the file (e.g. a message like &quot;hello 👋&quot; will show up in the .md file as &quot;hello &quot;). I'm not sure why!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Audio messages, quoted messages, &amp; non-image attachments:&lt;/b&gt; This setup won't work at all with audio messages, quoted messages, or non-image attachments. I'm working to see if there's a way to support those too, but unfortunately I haven't found a solution yet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forwarded messages: &lt;/b&gt;Forwarded messages are handled in a very buggy way, and I'm not entirely sure why. I don't mind too much because I almost never forward messages to my &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt;, but I did want to call it out because it has unexpected behavior. If you figure out what the issue is, let me know and I'll update this post!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Timezone: &lt;/span&gt;The &lt;code&gt;date::&lt;/code&gt; will be in whatever timezone you set in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/settings&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;IFTTT settings&lt;/a&gt;. It does not have the local time where you sent the message in Telegram. (For me, that's Eastern Time.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: Why use Dropbox at all if your Logseq notes are stored in iCloud?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately, IFTTT doesn't support iCloud as a plugin, but it does support Dropbox. So the next best thing was to sync the document&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also checked Zapier, and it doesn't support iCloud OR Telegram as plugins, so it was a no-go.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: What are the limitations of this solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;It doesn't work when the computer where you have the symlink isn't running.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note that this may create merge conflicts. To me this is okay, because I'm treating my &lt;code&gt;quick notes&lt;/code&gt; as purely append-only, so merge conflicts can't really happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: Why is this useful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1431258862838026244&quot;&gt;Here's a thread&lt;/a&gt; where I discuss the basic idea:&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;short-summary&quot;&gt;Remote work is creating a new economic niche, and countries that put in the work to fill it will finally be able to compete with the US to attract talent. This is the once-in-a-generation opportunity for small, stable countries to grow, diversify, and up-skill their economy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The United States has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clippings.devonzuegel.com/which-countries-do-migrants-want-to-move-to-world-economic-forum&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;#1 target destination&lt;/a&gt; for immigrants for generations. It has a mythical reputation as the place where anyone can go from rags to riches. It's been much more stable than many regions, and the American standard of living is much higher than the world average. However, the US makes it difficult to enter the country, preventing prospective immigrants from accessing these opportunities.&lt;div class=&quot;large-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4bb9e7e0-0010-48c2-9118-e3ea57ebca08/6148ed2b-4fb1-483e-a04e-02d446923f79.png&quot; width=&quot;90&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Competition for talent follows a steep &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law&quot;&gt;power law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even so, it's been hard to compete with the US for talent. Countries' ability to compete for immigrants has historically followed a steep power law. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clippings.devonzuegel.com/which-countries-do-migrants-want-to-move-to-world-economic-forum&quot;&gt;2016 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;, 3.5x more prospective migrants wanted to move to the US than to Germany, the second-most desirable location.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Remote work has changed this equation dramatically. Accelerated by the pandemic, it's more possible than ever to attract highly skilled, highly paid residents and bring their high incomes and valuable know-how into your community. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Small, stable countries in favorable timezones have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;once-in-a-generation opportunity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; at their fingertips. &lt;/span&gt;Welcome these talented, energetic go-getters into your country, and you will rapidly stimulate your economy, up-skill the local population, and prepare your country for the future.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This proposition will be especially attractive to countries that are keen to:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Diversify the economy&lt;/span&gt;: Countries with concentrated economies (often around tourism) need to diversify their economies for long-term sustainability and antifragility. Welcoming immigrants to do remote knowledge work is a rapid way way to expand beyond their traditional economic base. (examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/789517/caribbean-direct-contribution-travel-tourism-gdp-country/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Aruba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knoema.com/atlas/Croatia/topics/Tourism/Travel-and-Tourism-Total-Contribution-to-GDP/Contribution-of-travel-and-tourism-to-GDP-percent-of-GDP&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ride the wave of technological change: &lt;/span&gt;Some countries have realized that the world is changing and are aggressively embracing change to not get left behind. Welcoming high-skilled immigrants is one way to accelerate this transition. (examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/fintech/regulatory-sandbox&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Reverse a demographic spiral:&lt;/span&gt; Still other countries are seeing their populations shrink, as the demographic pyramid has more old people than young people. Immigrants of all types can help reverse this trend. (examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-./bienvenidos-uruguay-adios-argentina&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;How has remote work opened up new opportunities?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remote work opens up new opportunities for what I call &quot;immigration arbitrage&quot;. It's historically been difficult for most places to attract immigrants with lots of education and earning potential, because those immigrants generally sought cities like London or New York or San Francisco where they could plug into an economic powerhouse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Remote work has changed this dynamic for many industries. Now, you don't need to be in San Francisco to be a highly productive programmer or in London to be a highly productive stock trader. Now, if you're in Mexico City, you can call in to your colleague sitting in a SF and you can make the same contributions as them, yet without having to actually physically be in the US. You're close enough that you can fly in for the quarterly team retreat or annual company conference, but you don't have to get an employment visa.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This opportunity is especially open to countries with ideal time zones, if they're willing to create a welcoming environment for people in their region or around the world to work with world class companies in the same time zone. For example, Vancouver has been an early mover on this opportunity. Tech companies based in San Francisco and Seattle have &quot;innovation hubs&quot; whose primary role is to create a place that talent that hasn't been able to get a visa to the US. We've also started to see this in places like Lagos and Buenos Aires. Nigerian developers can work alongside startups in Berlin and London, while Argentinian developers work as consultants for companies based in the US. We're going to be seeing a lot more of this now that remote work is more widely accepted by companies worldwide. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This also gives these cities a better chance of becoming knowledge economy powerhouses in their own right. Before, they had a cold start problem—these places lacked the critical mass of key talent, so those who did have the skills and motivation would leave for greener pastures. Now, they can compete to initially bring people to their city on dimensions other than economic network effects (e.g. climate, quality of life, regulatory arbitrage, safety), and then once you have a critical mass of people, it starts a flywheel to develop an ecosystem of its own, rather than just a &quot;little brother&quot; of an existing hub. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;This strategy is defensible&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's difficult for the largest, richest countries to copy this strategy, because:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Immigration is politically unpopular in places like the US, France, Japan, and UK. Compared to countries that haven't received much immigration in the past, it is unlikely for these economic juggernauts to dramatically change direction and put out the welcome mat, even to highly skilled immigrants. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In addition, these countries have giant populations, so even with the political will to welcome immigrants, the bureaucracy is likely to act more slowly than smaller, more nimble countries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Large countries also have less to gain on a percentage basis. If 10,000 highly skilled Hong Kongers move to the US (population 330 million), it will show up as a small blip on the overall GDP of the country. If that same group moves to The Caymans (population 65 thousand), growth would skyrocket.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is great news for smaller, less wealthy countries, because it gives them a defensible advantage against &lt;a href=&quot;https://clippings.devonzuegel.com/which-countries-do-migrants-want-to-move-to-world-economic-forum&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;the incumbents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Which countries are well-positioned for this opportunity?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here are some characteristics that make a country especially well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. They're not all necessary for success—I can't think of any countries meet all of these criteria anyways—but the more the country has, the more likely it will be competitive at attracting immigrants:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Small and nimble&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good climate, natural beauty&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Timezone that matches some of the world's biggest economies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Short flight to the world's biggest economies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Short flights to immigrants' home countries&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;English-speaking&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Political and monetary stability&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Openness to change/innovation – e.g. regulatory arbitrage as a bonus&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Low cost of living&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good educational opportunities &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here are some countries that meet many of these criteria. Which countries would you add to the list?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Uruguay&lt;/span&gt; – Island of stability in a sea of instability in Latin America. Nestled between Argentina and Brazil (two countries with growing social unrest and, in Argentina's case, high inflation). Good timezone to collaborate with both the US and Europe. I'd expect Uruguay to be especially interested in this strategy, given attracting immigrants is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/three-priorities-for-uruguays-new-president/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;one of the current president's top priorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/span&gt; – Stable, high quality of living, good educational system including world-class universities, close to the US, English-speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pt/status/1072199359998046208&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;welcomes immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, access to great amenities like restaurants, already has a strong base of knowledge workers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/span&gt; – Beautiful, in the EU but lower cost of living than other EU members, one of the safest countries in the world, short flight to centers of commerce like London and Paris and Berlin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/span&gt; – English-speaking, physical safety. This city state has long been a place for highly educated, high net worth people from around the region to move to escape political instability and high taxes. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Caribbean islands&lt;/span&gt; – Proximity to the US, beautiful climate, relative safety. The native language for many of these island nations is English, &quot;the language of commerce&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Panama&lt;/span&gt; – Stable and safe relative to its neighbors. Could be attractive for people in the Central American region to move there and still be close to home. I could also imagine people from South America moving there, since they have a shared language and it's closer to the US than Uruguay. The US dollar is widely used in Panama. Also, Panama has world famous beaches and surfing, which are very attractive to a certain subset of knowledge workers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/span&gt; – Similar story to Panama, with the addition that it also has a thriving biotech manufacturing sector. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Immigrant groups to cater to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The following groups have lots of people who are highly educated and have a lot of potential to contribute to the knowledge economy, yet have growing reasons to leave their home. A smart country would do well to attract these high-potential people and make it as easy as possible to put down roots:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Cubans&lt;/span&gt; – Stuck in a Communist regime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/08/cuba-doctors-meager-pay/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;surplus of doctors&lt;/a&gt; (and so many other countries have a shortage of doctors!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Hong Kongers&lt;/span&gt; – Fleeing the growing influence of the Chinese government in Hong Kong; in some cases they are coordinating immigration as a group, which brings additional opportunities for becoming the place for Hong Kongers to end up. (The Taiwanese may be in a similar position soon.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Argentinians&lt;/span&gt; – Recession, high inflation, low social trust, high taxes, high crime&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Brazilians&lt;/span&gt; – Recession, political instability, extremely high crime&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Venezuelans&lt;/span&gt; – Hyperinflation, physical danger, repressive government&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/span&gt; – Sectarian conflict, economic meltdown&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Nigeria &lt;/span&gt;– Growing political instability, high poverty, poor infrastructure&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which groups would you add to this list? &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/page/contact&quot;&gt;Let me know!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Obstacles &amp; problems to solve&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's an incomplete list of challenges that will make this shift more difficult. I believe they are all surmountable, but important to take into account. Let me know what you'd add to this list!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Labor laws&lt;/span&gt; – It's complex to follow labor laws in lots of different countries, though companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://remote.com/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Remote.com&lt;/a&gt; are making this easier over time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Foreign exchange &amp; capital controls&lt;/span&gt; – Foreign exchange is complicated, expensive, and at times risky. In addition, some countries' governments make it very difficult to move money in and out of the country.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Language barriers&lt;/span&gt; – It is challenging for teams to work together when there are large language differences between team members. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Cultural differences&lt;/span&gt; – The business culture in San Francisco is very different from the business culture in Buenos Aires, for example, and as a result people may work less productively with each other at first because misunderstandings may be more common than people who were educated in the same business culture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Time zones&lt;/span&gt; – Distant timezones can make collaborations very difficult, and even small timezone differences can result in additional overhead to keep everyone in the loop. This gets especially tricky in the spring/autumn when clocks around the world change at different times (or not at all) for Daylight Savings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Trust building&lt;/span&gt; – Most people I speak to say that it's harder to build trust over video chat vs in-person, and I have to say I agree (though it's not impossible!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Pay equality&lt;/span&gt; – It's not generally agreed upon whether people doing the same job in different places should get paid the same amount or if their pay should be adjusted according to their local cost of living. I've seen this create a lot of tension on teams.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Rather than being discouraged by these challenges, I'm excited. There are so many businesses to be built, and so many opportunities for governments to create value! If you're working on a solution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/page/contact&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As an American, I'm sad the US is frittering away its enviable position as the world's most desirable immigration destination. But if we're not going to use this opportunity to power the American engine of economic growth, I'm at least happy that the world is changing to enable other countries to take on this mantle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.econlib.org/archives/2014/07/open_borders_an_3.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;trillion dollar bill&lt;/a&gt; is lying on the ground, the important thing is that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;somebody&lt;/span&gt; picks it up, even if it's not us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;We tend to choose larger homes than we want our neighbors to choose. The result: sprawling development &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;that doesn't match what people actually want from their communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;People aim to maximize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;when deciding where to live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All things equal, most people like living in places with easy access to their day-to-day life. It's nice to be able to walk your kids to kindergarten, and it's easier to keep a social life when many of your friends live on your same street. When you run out of dish soap, you're grateful that you can resupply at the bodega downstairs rather than having to drive 20 minutes to a supermarket.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All things equal, we also want as much space as possible. We like having space for a gym, a separate bedroom for each kid, and a yard where we can relax when the weather is nice. Space also brings us silence, peace, and privacy. On a 10-acre estate, we don't have to hear our neighbors mow the lawn or hush their baby at 2am, and we don't have nosy neighbors wondering why the milkman is lingering so long inside the house.&lt;div style=&quot;display: none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/cb9b749e-3e97-4a95-ae2b-6ef2fd6e71e6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-grey-border--wrapper wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/42266f52-b985-4e3a-b308-8baf6c8d1b64.png&quot; width=&quot;457&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;High population density increases the quantity (and diversity!) of services a neighborhood can support, but it also requires each residence to occupy less land on average.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/3bf93a66-3057-4039-a6e8-8bca2c00b721.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/4a1f0d9f-388a-4d8b-a84f-321be0939566.jpg&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;At the extremes, maximizing &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;access&lt;/span&gt; looks like Hong Kong, and maximizing &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; looks like Wyoming.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;But there's a fundamental tradeoff between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Access to amenities requires a population density that can support those amenities, and space requires... well, it requires space. Clever design can do a lot to reduce this tradeoff, but ultimately more space per person results in fewer people on any given land area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If we want more amenities closer to us, everything needs to take less space on average. If we want more space, everything needs to be farther away from us on average, reducing our access to those people and services.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Imagine a neighborhood where everyone lives in a 8-story Parisian apartment building. Now, let's move them all to a neighborhood with 1-story single-family homes with 2x the footprint. By an extremely conservative first approximation, everything takes 16x more space, which means points with a similar number of people between them are 4x farther apart. Your friend who lived 15 minutes away now lives 60 minutes away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-grey-border--wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/723ae91c-37e2-4c1b-8336-a56b1f6a9c3a.png&quot; width=&quot;737&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what? Can't we each just decide how we individually want to balance access and space, move to a community that matches those preferences, and be done with it? If you like having ramen shops open at 2am and I like peaceful morning walks where I don't see another soul for hours, you move to Tokyo and I'll move to Maine. What's the problem?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Your neighbors' housing decisions shape the options available to you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you live in a tiny apartment but everyone else chooses a sprawling &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMansion&quot;&gt;McMansion&lt;/a&gt;, then you get the downsides of a small home with none of the upsides of a vibrant, dense city. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the extreme case, if every other human on earth decides that they value a yard more than the ability to walk to work, then all neighborhoods will be suburban. If you want to live in a 5-story walkup with a bodega downstairs within walking distance of your job, you're out of luck—those neighborhoods just don't exist.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;(Interestingly, this is asymmetric: if everyone else chooses to live in tiny apartments in a city, you could still go to the countryside and live a rural life far away from them.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Okay, sure. So what? The scenario where &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/span&gt; prefers a larger space and gives up access to urban amenities isn't realistic. There are plenty of people who prefer city living. Why not just move to a dense neighborhood filled with those people?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dense neighborhoods are undersupplied, because urban density is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Tragedy of the Commons.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While there are some places where enough people have leaned towards density and access over space and privacy, there is more demand for these neighborhoods than there is supply. Part of the reason for this is because urban density behaves like a classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot;&gt;Tragedy of the Commons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The aggregation of everyone's preference for more space leads to an undersupply of dense urban neighborhoods. This happens even in cases where everyone in the neighborhood wishes it were more dense and urban!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Let's walk through the game theory. You don't control what your neighbors will do, and there's a spectrum from dense to sparse that any given neighborhood has already collectively chosen. To simplify our model, let's treat these as binary options and just look at the extremes on either end of the spectrum, but keep in mind that there are possibilities in the middle too. These are the two simplified possibilities for how your neighbors might behave:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Your neighbors all choose to live in &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; homes that are densely packed with each other, enabling a vibrant urban environment with lots of interesting amenities like parks and restaurants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Your neighbors all live in &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;large&lt;/span&gt; homes that span multiple acres, enabling them to have maximum privacy, space, and control within their own domain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Now imagine you don't have control over which of those two neighborhoods you're house hunting in, but you do have a choice between two options of where you will live in that neighborhood, both of which are within your budget:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A tiny apartment, too small to host a dinner party.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;A luxurious mansion, with plenty of guest bedrooms to host friends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Everyone I know would choose the luxurious mansion in a heartbeat. Regardless of which path your neighbors take, you're going to do the same thing: you're going to look for the largest, nicest home you can find that falls within your budget. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Nash equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;, a fancy way of saying that you're going to choose the same strategy regardless of how your neighbors behave around you. If everyone else lives in a small space to maximize the population density of a neighborhood, you can free ride on that and choose a bigger home to get the benefits of both more space &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; access to the amenities enabled by density.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Let's model this in a game theory matrix:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper img-grey-border--wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/094d9c94-8397-4f97-b0ac-ea357b31f522.png&quot; width=&quot;248&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;But if every home in a city was a mansion, it wouldn't be a city anymore; it would be a suburb.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When one household chooses a larger home, it doesn't have a noticeable effect. But if we apply this logic to every person who lives in a city, the effect is a huge expansion of the city's footprint, pushing the market towards larger homes on average. In turn, this makes neighborhood populations more sparse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Put another way, each of us tends to choose a larger homes than we want our neighbors to choose. Of course most people can't afford a mansion, but they will always want as much space as they can get. Financial constraints keep this dynamic from spiraling out of control, but at the margin there's constant pressure towards sprawl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The result: an undersupply of urban neighborhoods.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/fd999f3e-641b-455e-ade6-a292fc0dc7dc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 1000; --en-naturalHeight: 562;&quot; width=&quot;246&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;If every New Yorker lived in an enormous private home like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theadventurine.com/jewelry/studio-and-boutique-tours/everything-old-is-new-again-at-the-cartier-mansion/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Cartier Mansion&lt;/a&gt;, it wouldn't be a city anymore; it would be a suburb.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The good/bad news is we're far from the efficient frontier of the access vs space tradeoff.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Most cities currently make terrible use of space, causing people to be more spread out than they need to be, even when taking into account our general preference for more private space. This is bad news to the extent that we're wasting a lot of space unnecessarily right now, but in a way it's also good news: there's plenty for us to do to improve it!&lt;div class=&quot;img-no-shadow--wrapper large-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/ec33c387-367d-4c5d-b584-a60c2d6480ad/4a847787-8fd8-444a-8a7c-9afaad2113a3.png&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are so many ways we could increase access to amazing things without sacrificing space. A full list of these ideas warrants a post all of its own, but I'll share three examples that jump to mind:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Most cities in the US have parking minimums for buildings, including apartment developments targeting residents who don't own a car. This results in lots of extra parking spaces that spread out our cities and make it harder for us to reach each other. (There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betterinstitutions.com/blog/2016/1/2/map-a-parking-lot-with-all-of-la-countys-186-million-parking-spaces&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;3.3 spaces per vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in LA County, for example.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many coastal cities put highways right on the waterfront, blocking access to the ocean. This is some of the most coveted real estate in any city, and people in cars barely appreciate the view and ocean air anyways! Instead, make a long thin park along the entire waterfront, and make it the backyard of the first row of buildings. Then, put the first road on inside of that first row of buildings to protect park-goers from the car noise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we replaced all on-street parking with more spaces in parking garages, we would have a lot more public land on the street. This wouldn't even have to sacrifice the absolute number of parking spaces! Just take advantage of vertical space by stacking them in a parking garage. The street space this saves could be used in so many ways. It could be turned into wider bike lanes, linear parks that line all of our streets with flowers, or literally anything else besides car storage. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There is so much low-hanging fruit to use the space in our cities better, even before trying to tackle the broader coordination problem. I find it reassuring to know that although this tragedy of the commons will be hard to solve, there's plenty we can do before we have to face that final boss.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What would you add to the list?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Drivers are responsible for finding private storage for their cars, just like any other private possession. The result is lovely, and I'd love to see more cities adopt this policy!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I recently visited Próspera, a Honduran startup city. I had a ton of questions and figured others might too, so I wrote an FAQ to share what I learned:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin-top: -4px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bolder; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(54, 125, 162, 0.4) !important&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ia-sXZ2kVYA8Wd89SN_9_2O7uExMz8j5WkzwEAGLbmM&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Próspera FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This FAQ is intended as a reference, covering the basic facts and current status of the project. My hope is that this document will help startup city builders learn from the path Próspera is carving. It covers a range of topics:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;infrastructure in Próspera and its neighbors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Honduras' unique legal autonomy framework&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;institutional structure of Próspera&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;taxes and tariffs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Próspera's business model&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;political environment in Honduras&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;local context, economy, and culture of Roatán, the island where Próspera is located&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;e-residency and physical residency&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;current population of Próspera and what made them to decide to move there&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;... and more!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001&quot; id=&quot;001&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon:&lt;/a&gt; Hello, and welcome to the fifth episode of the Order Without Design podcast. Today's episode is a little different from the previous ones. It's a conversation between Alain Bertaud and our friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_anthonyling&quot;&gt;Anthony Ling&lt;/a&gt;. Anthony is the editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://caosplanejado.com/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Caos Planejado&lt;/a&gt;, a website devoted to building better cities in Brazil, Anthony's home. Most of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Caos Planejado&lt;/span&gt;'s content is in Portuguese, but this conversation between Anthony and Alain is in English, so we figured it would be fun to share it with you all. In Portuguese, &quot;caos planejado&quot; means &quot;planned chaos&quot;, which is very much in the same spirit of the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2I3t0q0&quot;&gt;Alain's book&lt;/a&gt;, and this podcast, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Order Without Design&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm really excited to share this with you all because Brazil is a country that has a lot of urban growth that is happening right now and frankly a lot of problems that it is working through. But it is also a place with a huge amount of opportunity to improve people's lives through cities. So I'm really happy to share this with you all and for Anthony to be the host of this podcast because he has a really great perspective, having lived in Brazil for most of his life. You can find the original recording of this episode and many more episodes and articles on &lt;a href=&quot;http://caosplanejado.com/&quot;&gt;caosplanejado.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

At the time, maybe Le Corbusier was in his 70s, the Athens Charter, maybe the birth of modern urban planning is from 1933. So how was modernist urban planning and Le Corbusier seen in Paris and urban academia at the time that you were studying?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/825600f0-0025-4e3b-beea-dab6967c3cb0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;265&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003&quot; id=&quot;003&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Well, he became, let's say in the 60s, he became part of the establishment, really. Being a dissenter in the 20s and the 30s, he was attacking the establishment, the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and in the 60s he was literally a god. I mean he was a bull, everybody was admiring him, going to his conference. To the point that in 1963, the study of architecture at the time were very long, it was eight years, you know after admission, so extremely long, with no intermediary degree, by the way. So in 63 I get a little bored by my study at the Beaux-Arts and I decided to take a year off, I mean nine months off. And I went to Chandigarh to work there because Chandigarh at the time were being built and it was considered to be the best type of planning. So it was a little before Brasilia, Chandigarh started earlier. So I went there, by the way, by hitchhiking from Marseilles which could not be done now. But crossing Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and arriving in Chandigarh. I worked there with a cousin of Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, were there. And suddenly living in Chandigarh, if I had been a tourist, probably I would have been convinced that this was a fantastic city. But I was living there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004&quot; id=&quot;004&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; You know, I have colleagues, I had to go to the office every morning and suddenly I realized, oh, all this concept of the self-contained sectors with a commercial area in the center and all these things didn't work, really. Not only planning but the architectural thing, to have what they call brise-soleil, to cut the sun with a slab of concrete, which in fact become like ideators. And also the dust before the monsoon accumulate on this slab of concrete and then the wind blow them up inside the room. I mean, everything was wrong. When I was with my colleague we wanted to go to a restaurant, have a drink or even buy some clothes or something, we would go to a slum area. You know people were building Chandigarh as build a slum because they could not afford to live in Chandigarh. So for me this was an awakening, that all the theory that when i read Corbusier I admired, I think this is completely rational. At the time the utopia was functional, something has to be functional. The shape should follow the function and we should not have ornament or anything, the function itself is the thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005&quot; id=&quot;005&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So that was a utopia and I realized that it doesn't work, you cannot plan a commercial area and decide what type of shop will be there and where they will be. They happen when... in a way the people who open a bakery or restaurant have more information than the planners, so they know where to put it. And that's why they happen in the slum because then it's not only that it's cheaper, it's because there is a freedom of location. So that was my big thing. And I attended two of Corbusier' lecture there and I found him extremely bitter and negative, by the way. He was a very difficult man. So that was the atmosphere at the time. There was also this saying that, if you believe that everything has to be irrational, of course you have your own rationality from where you are. As a Frenchman of the 20th century, and you think that rationality of course is universal and you should impose it on others who are not... so that's why he came... then a bit later was Philip Johnson or Mies Van Der Rohe or the international style, which said, that, again, is rationality. So it's universal, there should not be an archetype of architectural planning which is specific to Brazil or China or India because rationality, it's like mathematics for instance, we are all using the same mathematics. And so the idea that planning will be like mathematics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/436749ad-b417-4c43-8db9-e17b971f47d4.webp&quot; width=&quot;345&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Plan Voisin, a planned redevelopment of central Paris designed by architect Le Corbusier in 1925&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#006&quot; id=&quot;006&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, yeah. And Alain, you mentioned back then Le Corbusier, at least when he was beginning, he was let's say challenging the mainstream. What was the mainstream before and how were these ideas seen in Paris? For example, Solly Angel mentions about classic urban planning, right? Commissioners' Plan in New York, Cerdà's, Barcelona expansion. Even Haussmann's renovation in Paris. How were these ideas perceived when you were a student, and what were your thoughts back then?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#007&quot; id=&quot;007&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; We thought they were obsolete. You know? And it's all in a way, it's a bit complex. Because on one hand we were living in Paris and we admired Paris. When you walk through Paris you have so many things which are interesting. And at the same time, when Corbusier say we want to destroy the street, the street should disappear. The idea was so radical that it was attractive, even though it's a complete nonsense of course. And especially when you live in Paris when the streets are, because of the lack of zoning, you have a bakery, a hairdresser but also an art gallery completely mixed up. And that's what makes the attraction of Paris, the variety. So strangely I think people enjoy this anti-establishment, a revolutionary kind of thing. The establishment was still rather powerful, including at Ecole Des Beaux-Arts, but they were paying lip service to Corbusier because those idea were very popular among the young. So they will pay some lip service but continue basically, I would say not classic, but kind of an outcome of Art Deco. But in planning pretty much the continuation of the idea of Haussmann or Cerdà.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#008&quot; id=&quot;008&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So there was this antinomy. And of course the idea of Corbusier, Corbusier never accept Chandigarh and his possible influence in Brasilia, and never building this city. He didn't have any success in urban planning, really, except in the public housing. The government embraced the idea of Corbusier for public housing. Precisely because the people who live there were not the clients. The client, when you build a new city, are the civil servants who are giving you contracts. It is not the people who are going to live in the city. So there is no feedback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#009&quot; id=&quot;009&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, and I noticed having been to Paris that Parisian suburbs with public housing and the expansion of the Paris metro area is radically different from Paris and probably has a lot of inspiration in Le Corbusier.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010&quot; id=&quot;010&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah that's right, because the government intervened. I don't think that there is a private sector, let's say, response to Corbusier. It's always public because you know in a way Corbusier was asking for norms, uniformity and norms. And that is very attractive for civil servants. When they pass contracts if you have norms, this is simple to administer and life is not simple.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011&quot; id=&quot;011&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; And what about Haussmann? Haussmann in Paris, maybe today, is there a consensus view about what was done in Paris? And what are your views? I've seen you talking about maybe what he did, Paris could not survive without it maybe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/52084c6c-d560-4be4-a530-2f5c84d007d1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;392&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Haussmann transformed Paris in the mid 1800s. He sliced through the medieval city's winding streets with grand boulevards to enable traffic to cross from one side of the city to the other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012&quot; id=&quot;012&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, that's right. You know in a large city you need mobility and before Haussmann it was true that Paris was still a medieval city in a large area. You know to have a real idea, there were very few sociological study, but if you read the novels of Balzac, Balzac described housing. And Balzac wrote in 1830, so you know about 20, 30 years before Haussmann. And he described a lot of neighborhood or people living in some neighborhood. And you see that they were really slum, in the same sense that the slum of London described by Dickens. But the problem was not housing, the problem was really moving around the city. And I think Haussmann solved that in a way. But what was... if you compare Haussmann to, say, Robert Moses for instance in New York, the advantage of Haussmann, Haussmann was a real estate operation, it was not an infrastructure operation. He didn't dig a boulevard just to move, like you would move a highway. It was entirely financed by selling land on both side of the boulevard to the private sector. So it was borrowing money from the private sector in real estate, and that I think is the big difference for Brasilia, for instance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013&quot; id=&quot;013&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Brasilia was not financed by the real estate, it was financed by the Brazilian tax payer. Where Paris Haussmann was financed by people who bought land on both side of the new boulevard, so this had to have value that people would recognize. And that's a big difference between this and public housing built by government in the suburbs. So the charm of Paris, in a way, is that along those boulevard, what was built was entirely demand driven although the boulevard themself were top down obviously. But what was built on both side of the boulevard was demand driven.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014&quot; id=&quot;014&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Right, right. So you mentioned Moses and maybe we can move onto your period in New York, actually.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#015&quot; id=&quot;015&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#016&quot; id=&quot;016&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; So you say you arrived in 1968?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#017&quot; id=&quot;017&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, January 1968, yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#018&quot; id=&quot;018&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; I believe that was the year Jane Jacobs left New York to move to Toronto?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#019&quot; id=&quot;019&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes exactly, yeah right. You know she had the trial for rioting or something, and I think she had to pay a fine or something and then she moved to Canada, that year. But say, at the time her fight was very much in the news in New York. There was a newspaper which has disappeared now which was called The Village Voice, but that's a very liberal, you know, everybody in the university or even educated people who read, on top of the New York Times. The Village Voice and there were a number of journalists and also writers who write in The Village Voice. So The Village Voice were really the voice of Jane Jacobs at the time, yes. And their continuation, the...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#020&quot; id=&quot;020&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Her works, The Death And Life of Great American Cities is from 1961, The Economy of Cities is from 1969. So she was writing in The Village Voice. Was she already an influence within urban planning circles? Did you read her books at the time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#021&quot; id=&quot;021&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; No, because they were not published yet. I read them four or five years later. I think she wrote her book when she moved to Canada, if I remember well. I don't remember it. But I read about her and it was more, let's say, it was more anti-Moses than pro-Jacobs, in a way. The theory of Jane Jacobs I think most people became familiar with them about 10 years later. Of course anybody who lived in the village, or was close to the village, you know Greenwich Village and the idea that a highway will cross over Washington Park is... in a way this was not a real estate operation, you see like Haussmann, it was an infrastructural operation. To move trucks or cars from, let's say New Jersey to Long Island basically, that was the idea. The idea that a highway like that I think could be justified if it was underground because it would give value to both sides, for instance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#022&quot; id=&quot;022&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But say you cut the highway in an existing urban fabric you will have a decrease in value of real estate. You cut Manhattan into two and probably within a kilometer north and south of the highway you will have a semi-dead urban fabric because all the street would be dead ends in the middle of Manhattan. Where in fact Manhattan is a continuity, it's not even... I mean there are some centers like Greenwich Village or Midtown or Wall Street, but those are linked by a continuity, they are not self-sufficient. It's vectors which goes from Wall Street to Harlem. And if you cut, think, it's like cutting a limb. Some parts would become dead. So the real cost of such a highway if it was justified in terms of mobility would be enormous because you had this, the valuation of real estate on both side. My estimate would be about a kilometer on both sides which would lose complete value. And Manhattan in itself, being cut in two, would also lose value. You will have a fragmentation also of the labor market there because of the difficulty of moving back and forth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#023&quot; id=&quot;023&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; We've seen in many large Brazilian cities these urban express ways having exactly this affect and there are some discussions today, maybe tearing down some of them. So this is very close to our reality.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#024&quot; id=&quot;024&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, to my dismay I found also that sometimes the BRT, you know the bus rapid transit, has the same effect. I found that in Curitiba, some part of Curitiba, but even more in Bogota. If you look at let's say the real estate on both sides of the TransMilenio in Bogota, you see that it's always very low value, it's equivalent of having a value. It could be maybe solved by some urban design thing which allow more... that's possible. But as it is, I think it is a bit a Robert Moses operation. Although BRT of course branch on people all around, so it has a positive side, obviously, it moves a lot of people at a cheap price. But the real estate issue is not solved in the BRT, especially in Curitiba, I mean some part of Curitiba.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/cdb1ef37-c057-47b9-85df-59688f2c9c77.jpg&quot; width=&quot;481&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Curitiba in Brazil was the first city in the world to implement a full BRT system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#025&quot; id=&quot;025&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, many of the BRTs we have here are indeed very wide and to cross it they built pedestrian walkways which are not very friendly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#026&quot; id=&quot;026&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah. So that could be solved I suppose with urban design. In my book I don't treat urban design, the book is long enough like that. But I think it's an important part, a complementary part, you know? Again, a park like Washington Square is very effective although it's relatively small, it's four hectares. Very, very effective because it's a good design. But there are parks which are larger which are not very effective because they are not accessible, nobody goes there. So design is a very, very important part of planning and land use in general.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#027&quot; id=&quot;027&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Definitely. So Alain, going back to New York and Jane Jacobs, right? So you mentioned your perceptions today about what was the effect of these expressways going through the city. So back then in the late 1960s, 1970s, were you working at city hall in New York?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#028&quot; id=&quot;028&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; My first job was with Philip Johnson, you know the architect Philip Johnson. And it was an incredible experience because it was in the Seagram Building, you know built by Mies Van Der Rohe, it's one of the best skyscrapers in New York, certainly in terms of design. And coming from Paris where I've never been in a building than eight floors, there were no skyscrapers in France at the time. And also the architects in France at the time wanted to give an image of being bohemian, although they were business like everybody else. So they dressed like Che Guevara and everything like that, and suddenly I end up with Philip Johnson. Philip Johnson was always dressed in the best Italian suits and inside the office you had a thing, there was a Giacometti sculpture at the entrance, there was a Picasso tapestry and a Miró tapestry also at the entrance. It was an incredibly different...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#029&quot; id=&quot;029&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But I quickly found it very boring, although it looked very good on my resume as an architect because there was again this goal thing, it was exactly the same thing as for Corbusier, people worshiped Philip Johnson and I think he was an interesting guy. He was very witty, but I don't think he had a clue about anything, frankly. So it was very frustrating in a way to work there. So after about five or six months I think I started meeting people and thanks by the way to the American culture which is much... as foreigners, we didn't know anybody but we were very quickly invited by all sorts of people. And so we established a network. We had I think a larger network of friends in New York after six months than we had in Paris after five years. So I found a job then in the city planning department. It was the time of Mayor Lindsay and it was a time of the black panther, black power.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#030&quot; id=&quot;030&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; I think they were... I guess, they never told me that, but I guess I was hired because of my French accent. They were desperate to dialogue with the black community but there was such a, let's say, lack of confidence between let's say the white establishment and the black community. That they found I was a nice intermediary in the sense that nobody in Harlem.... well they were not completely sure I was white and they could not identify me in a box because of my accent. So it was much easier for me to relate there. So first I worked next to city hall in the planning department in downtown, then after that we moved into an office in Harlem and then I stayed in Harlem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#031&quot; id=&quot;031&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; By the way, trying to sell to the community a completely absurd project. The idea, it was a project designed by MIT professors. The idea was to continue Park Avenue into Harlem and by building a vault over the railway which is under Park Avenue and then moving poor people into this new building on both side of Park Avenue, the idea at the time was very common all over the world was, if you built very nice houses for poor people, then the problem is solved. You eradicate poverty by just building nice housing for them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#032&quot; id=&quot;032&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; At the time Harlem had a lot of problem, crime and drug addiction was incredible. Basically the building on both side of Park Avenue on you know, Lexington and Madison, many of the building were abandoned and just used by junkies as heroin alley, something like that, the drug alley. So it's not... building new housing there will not solve this problem of crime. Actually it would have been made worse because to communicate between the two part of Harlem, east Harlem and west Harlem, you would have to go under this vault which was even much larger, wider. So will have a little tunnel and tunnels are not very good in an area where are full of crime and drug addicts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#033&quot; id=&quot;033&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; So I think Alain, I think by this time Robert Moses was already stepping out of city hall.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#034&quot; id=&quot;034&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes. He was never in city hall, he was never elected. But he was a very powerful, I think the word of [Robert Pierot 00:24:04], the power broker, that's exactly what he was without being elected because he had so many connections with the building industry, the highway industry and politicians. Well, everything he did was not negative, the police had, for instance, so Jones Beach, thing like that were valid things. Except that the highway to go to Jones Beach had very low beaches to prevent buses from using it because he didn't want the rabble of the city to mess up the beaches.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#035&quot; id=&quot;035&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; So back then you mentioned you were at city hall and some of these projects were still, let's say, we could see them today as a little bit absurd. You mentioned that you when you were at Chandigarh you already had a, let's say, first awakening?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#036&quot; id=&quot;036&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#037&quot; id=&quot;037&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; So what were your thoughts at the time? How were your views on urban planning evolving and how did you see the way that they were planning Manhattan at the time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#038&quot; id=&quot;038&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; It was a bit of a continuation from Chandigarh, in a way. When I first worked on this project in Harlem, building this vault and using the air rights to build... there was still in my background as architect, and architects like to build things and especially new things which look different. So first I thought hey, this is great. This is a big project, I can... and again when you live in Harlem and you realize that going, for instance, under the existing railway which crossed Harlem was a dangerous place and people urinated there. You say, my project is going to triple the width of this tunnel. Then you realize, gee, I would not like to cross this. You have to take the subway on Lexington. So I will have to go from my office and go in there. Then suddenly you realize that what looks, as an architects, what looks like a great thing which will make it into a magazine is a terrible thing when you are on the ground. That was a continuity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#039&quot; id=&quot;039&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So I started doing things, especially when I was still downtown during my lunch break, I will go to certain place in the Wall Street area and I will try to count how people who were on foot move around the city. When you get out of the subway and you have to go to your office you have an alternative of several routes. Why would you take one route rather than another? So I started following people and noting on a map what they were doing, and I noted that sometime they didn't take the shorter route and they went into the most attractive route. Let's say more diverse where there were more shops, even if they didn't use the shop. So for me this pedestrian view of urban was very important, and I could see that this was something which normally completely neglected by planners. This street view of... for instance say, Philip Johnson built a library for NYU at Greenwich Village and Greenwich Village is interesting because they have so many shops and restaurants and the library, it's a blank wall, very beautiful red limestone. But suddenly it becomes boring.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#040&quot; id=&quot;040&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So I'm not saying that in the library you should have an opening for a coffee shop or something, maybe you should. The contact between the private space of a block and the street should be as transparent as possible. It should not be a fortress. So I think that's what's interesting and in a way, you mentioned yeah I was critical of some of what my colleagues were doing. And including, by the way, Marie-Agnes, at the time where working also at city hall, but she was working on giving incentives to make plaza like the Seagram Building, I talk about it in my book. Indeed the plaza of the Seagram Building is a success, urban design success, it's wonderful. But you cannot regulate good design, as soon as you regulate it you kill the design.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#041&quot; id=&quot;041&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So for instance on 6th Avenue, the idea that all the new skyscrapers there will be like the Seagram building with a plaza, so if all the buildings have a plaza there is no plaza, it's just a wider avenue. Then the lawyer take over because the plaza will be private space, that means that if anybody breaks his leg there or do anything the building is responsible for it, not the city, so they can be sued. So the lawyer convinced the architect to make this plaza as hostile as possible so there will be the least people possible, you see? But there is a logic to it, it's not just a conspiracy or bad will, there is a logic to it. And you have to understand this logic, why things do not succeed just through regulation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#042&quot; id=&quot;042&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Perfect, yeah the example of the plaza is excellent. So fast forward maybe 10, 15 years. Jane Jacob's books have come out, her work around some emergent order in cities is maybe one of the first to be written in that kind of writing. And to me it resonates a lot with the work that you have published recently, in a different way. Did her work influence you at the time? And how did you see it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#043&quot; id=&quot;043&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, relatively little. After New York we went to Yemen where we spent three years. So in Yemen Jane Jacob's books were not accessible although they were published at the time we were there, but we had no access to them. So Yemen, you know in a way what Jane Jacobs talk about, I had observed those things. Again in Chandigarh were more alive, more diversity than the planned city and things like that. But i didn't have a theory behind it, in a way it was a little anecdotal. In Yemen I observed also the density, I mean at the time the Yemeni were completely unplanned in the sense that people were just aggregating things. My main job in Yemen was really to trace new streets because the city was growing so fast and there was no system really, so I was trying... and so I observed a lot of things, like for instance, density decreased when you go away from the city. For me those were just personal observations, idiosyncrasies of cities. And it's only when I went to Haiti and I worked with an urban economist I realized that all these things that I had observed were in fact, urban economists, they have also observed them but measured them and made a theory of them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#044&quot; id=&quot;044&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So it confirmed, it gave a theoretical background to things that I had observed and thought positive. And it was the same thing for Jane Jacobs, in particular her book, The Economy of Cities, I think it's in this book where she talk also about the Turkish city built around obsidian, it had become an obsidian center, so the jobs accumulate. Then when obsidian is not more needed then the city disappear. So again that confirmed my view of the labor market, a city based on the labor market. So if you don't diversify, you start with obsidian but if you do not diversify and the city's not particularly that well located except for obsidian, then the city will disappear. I think that that so... so it was, if you want, I acquired slowly I will say, I won't call it academic knowledge, but say theoretical knowledge by other people while observing very carefully what was going on on the ground. Then I found a convergence with it, you know?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#045&quot; id=&quot;045&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; And a complete divergence, of course, with the idea of international style or even ideas like, at the time the big planners, there was a Greek firm called Doxiadis who built Islamabad, who built a lot of cities. I don't know if they did anything in Latin America, I forgot, probably they did.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#046&quot; id=&quot;046&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; There were a few plans in Brazil.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#047&quot; id=&quot;047&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; In Brazil, yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#048&quot; id=&quot;048&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; I believe in Rio De Janeiro.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#049&quot; id=&quot;049&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; oh yeah, of Doxiadis. And those were completely... these were really Corbusier type of thing, in a certain way. A complete rationality, built on formula without much observation of how people live in a city. The idea that you have a shopping street in the middle of a neighborhood because it's closest to all part. Like every neighborhood was completely isolated. A city is a continuity, a street is a continuity. So in a way Christoper Alexander I think have a better understanding in theoretical things than Doxiadis or again the continuation of this thing, the unit, the planned unit completely independent and self-sufficient. And the sector of Chandigarh were like that, there were the sectors which were 800 meter, if I remember well, by a kilometer or something like that. And all the commerce were in a little plaza and a few streets in the middle of the thing. Where in fact commerce thrived where people were moving. So it's good to be in the center like that for a primary school, but not good for commerce.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#050&quot; id=&quot;050&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; And Alain, look at this, let's say timeline, of urban utopias and ideas, right, I see a change in mindset, maybe beginning with garden cities or modernism where urban planners started to try to, let's say, organize city form, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#051&quot; id=&quot;051&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#052&quot; id=&quot;052&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; And since then, maybe Jane Jacobs is the first one to give a different perspective on the problem?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#053&quot; id=&quot;053&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#054&quot; id=&quot;054&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; But still after she published her works many planners tried to use the qualities and ideas she describes in her observations as a sort of design manual, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#055&quot; id=&quot;055&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#056&quot; id=&quot;056&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; So trying to regulate mixed income in the same buildings or the age of buildings, right, to give the qualities that Jacobs has described by observation and of a spontaneous outcome, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#057&quot; id=&quot;057&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Yeah this is the sad thing about it. Again it's the same story as the Seagram Building. The Seagram Building was a good design because it was unique there, and suddenly as soon as you start making it a general rule, then it destroys itself. What is important in Jane Jacobs is spontaneity, at the same time she didn't speak about spontaneous order like that exactly but something like that. She speaks about randomness, you know? And this is what's so difficult to accept for planners, randomness. That in a way we get back maybe to the idea of Hayek or even Adam Smith, individual initiative. People have knowledge, again, how to run a bakery, or a butcher in the case of Adam Smith. That planners don't know where to put, you know, how many butcher shop there should be and where there should be. So to make into a rule that, suddenly you observe that in Paris that you have say, a butcher for every 10,000 people and you say, aha, we are going to plan a city where you have a butcher, I say butcher but it could be anything else of course, a shopping center or something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#058&quot; id=&quot;058&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Then you get it wrong because precisely this thing is involving, depending on the way demand evolves. People maybe at a certain time will eat less meat or get their meat from somewhere else than the butcher. So the city should be allowed to evolve on that, I think that's an important contribution of Jane Jacobs', precisely this... so you should have a structure, after all the streets of Greenwich Village, if that was a model, were already there and they never change and she didn't want the street to change. But on these streets you build things differently depending on the way people evolve and technology evolve. And I think that's a message which is the most important, you know?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#059&quot; id=&quot;059&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So you have a spontaneous order that is made of individuals who are pursuing their own interests, let's say again in Adam Smith's theory, and who have special knowledge of their field like Hayek postulates. Then you have still, you absolutely need a structure which is top down, like Haussmann, on which you branch that. Then the important thing is that the communication between the private and the public, which often is very neglected. I reproach very much urban planners now to spend too much time trying to design what is happening in the private sector and not enough in the area where they are responsible for it and not enough in the designing the public space and especially the relationship between the public and the private space. For instance the opening of shops or if you have a garage how it should open so that you have a still maximum of life on the street and things like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#060&quot; id=&quot;060&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; There are some progress, I see now some progress in the design of sidewalk in New York in some area, so that's very good, especially when you have a pedestrian crossing thing like that, I think they have improved it. But I think this is new, this should have been, I think, the main concern of urban planners. I get back also to the question of BRT, I think that BRT suffer from a lack of good urban design, to link the station of BRT with the rest of the city and the way the city communicates across the BRT line, which are just urban design problems. I think this has been grossly neglected, but if you look at the New York zoning plan they go into minute details about the height of building, how far they should be from each other, the size of kitchen, the way the bathroom should be connected, I mean... I'm not talking here by the way about safety regulation, you know fire or sanitation. This I leave it to the customer, you don't know, you have to rely on the firemen to know what is a fire-proof building.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#061&quot; id=&quot;061&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But anything which is space-use, how much floor space you consume and how it is organized I think the consumer is the best judge to do that. And the shop-keeper too, in New York for instance, in many shop there is a minimum and maximum floor space for some reason. I don't know where it comes from, magic numbers that are coming from a...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#062&quot; id=&quot;062&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, exactly. So we've seen, since then, since Jacobs' we've seen a sort of explosion of new utopias, right? From new urbanism and even transit oriented development has a final view on the shape of how the city should look like, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#063&quot; id=&quot;063&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#064&quot; id=&quot;064&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; And my question is, I mean we've seen this since... I mean the garden city, it's like 120 years already right? And when Jane Jacobs came along with these new ideas but her ideas got lost somehow in the middle of the process and we're still not, let's say, in the path of going back to, let's say classical urban planning and I would like to know your views on why this happens. Sometimes I think, is it the fact that we learn urban planning and architecture as the same thing? Is it something else? Why do you think these ideas have endured for so long?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#065&quot; id=&quot;065&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes I think it is very, very difficult for architects and engineers and basically cities are built by engineers and architects and lawyers. It's very difficult for them to admit that there's spontaneous order, that there are certain things that they may not know and they should leave the maximum flexibility of land use because they want to optimize everything. It's easier, for instance if you want to optimize transport, I remember a case in Indonesia where the Japanese were planning a light rail through Jakarta and they have very competent, of course, traffic engineers. They calculated that to make this light rail viable they needed a density along the light rail of say, I forgot now, but say 250 people per hectare on the corridor of say one kilometer of both side of the light rail.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#066&quot; id=&quot;066&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So there idea was not to maximize mobility in Jakarta, it was to maximize the financial viability of their infrastructure. Now I am not saying that a light rail was not a good idea in Jakarta, but then the objective is a little different. So if the objective is to make the light rail work, not to make it optimum for moving around the city but to make it work, then of course they need to have this higher density there because there was no demand for this high density yet there, to say the area which are not around the light rail should have a mandatory low density in order to... which is a bit, by the way, the plan of Curitiba, in a way it's the same. So you try to maximize the efficiency of infrastructure, you decide on the infrastructure first, then you say the people around this infrastructure should be grouped that way so that my infrastructure will be very efficient.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#067&quot; id=&quot;067&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; This is not the right way to do things. In a way, although a transport system is public sector, but it's the same thing as when General Motors say, what's good for General Motor is good for the country, it's not necessarily true. So what's good for the light rail, the type of land use which is good for the light rail is not necessarily good for Jakarta. So at the same time in Jakarta, another example like that, and I think it answers very well your question, why we had the problem. The World Bank, by the way. We had very competent sewer engineers and drainage engineer and they look at Jakarta and the soil condition and they say, you know in a tropical country like that we do not need... we could get away without having a traditional sewer system, we could have oxidation ponds which are local and a seepage pit. But in order to do that the density would need to be less than 50 people per hectare. So they say the planners should plan a city of less than 50 people per hectare, then we will save a lot on the sewer. You put it in reverse here. Of course you should have a sewer which is the least expensive possible, but to serve the people where they are, not to design a city around a sewer system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#068&quot; id=&quot;068&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; No, that's a great example. The example you mentioned with the light rail in Indonesia, I would say it's basically the dominant idea in Brazil today. So the latest Sau Paulo master plan is based on this idea. So they allowed higher density but not that much, [FAR 00:45:12] of four-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#069&quot; id=&quot;069&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, that's...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#070&quot; id=&quot;070&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; ... around the main rail and BRT lines. But said okay, outside these areas we will want lower density and within the high density lines we will incentivize smaller units so we will have more people occupying these buildings and we will restrict the amount of parking, so people will also not use the car, they will use the rail or the bus system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#071&quot; id=&quot;071&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, you know again strangely enough, you see at the end of my short article there on the 15 minute city, I have a quotation of Tocqueville which in a way, when you look at the regulation you describe in Sau Paolo, it's people where they're really concerned about making things work. Then they establish rules so that the thing they designed will work without really considering why people in San Paulo some of them will have to use cars. Maybe a doctor, maybe a plumber obviously has to use a car. They say, well it would work so well if everybody walked, you know? And I think that then they put rules which seems not too tyrannical in a certain way, to say, well we are going to reduce parking, mandate... you know again I think parking should not be compulsory. It's a part of real estate and it should be operated privately because in many cities, subsidized parking. And in a way, if you, like in many cities of the world, you say for a shop of this you need that many parking lot. You are subsidizing it because you are obliging people to afford that. So I think it should be a part of real estate, in the same way as you should not decide how many bakery you have in a city, you should not decide how many parking space.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#072&quot; id=&quot;072&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But it should be market driven, that means it should not be subsidized, if there are people, then... then you should certainly be very careful about the urban design aspect, all this private parking lot where they will probably be underground, communicate with the city so they don't clog the city or be dangerous for pedestrians or anything like that. So that's an aspect that should be regulated, the urban design and the link between the two. But again to me the urban design is mostly in the public area which are not driven by markets, which are not driven by people preferences. You can observe the number of pedestrian in the street and say, well we need wider sidewalks. But the market is not going to give you wider sidewalks, there is no mechanism for that, even if there is a high demand. So here it has to be top down in a certain way. A lot of attention should be given to that, but much less to the size of apartment or things like that, which I think the people can decide by themselves. Certainly there should not be regulation to say what is the number of apartment of this size, of this size.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#073&quot; id=&quot;073&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; In New York we have in fact the opposite, we have, for each block, we have the maximum number of apartments which can be built in each block which is based on a number which was invented in 1962 based on densities at the time where the average household size was around five people. Now it's 1.3 I think in Manhattan or something like that. So it's a completely arbitrary number just coming out of nowhere, like if it was coming from the sign of the Zodiac or something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#074&quot; id=&quot;074&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; It's amazing, we still have a long way to go and I think your work is a huge inspiration for us. So Alain, I think your comment on the 15 minute city gives us a good hint for us to move onto questions of some of our supporters. So [Ivandrew 00:49:20], he sent a question through message. He asks if the argument for the 15 minute city couldn't work in fact as a marketing strategy, so maybe not for Paris where that city has already optimized for 15 minutes where it can, as you argued in your article. But maybe in Brazil or United States, Parisian suburbs that have not reached this level of accessibility or mixed use. So his question is maybe this concept would be a good way to summarize a goal for citizens who are not trained as urban planners.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#075&quot; id=&quot;075&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah I mean it's wonderful to have even a 10 minute city, my problem is not the goal, my problem is the way you achieve it. I think that you achieve, let's say the 10 minute city or the 15 minute city for things like food, schools or things like that. By removing regulation which prevent demand from being met. Do not forget that the 15 minute city depends on densities. If you look at all the plans around the world for zoning, the zoning prevents densities. You never have a zoning which... all the zoning limit densities. Either by floor ratio, by a minimum-maximum number of dwelling unit per hectare, by setbacks, by all sorts of things. So if you want to increase accessibility you have this trade off that you have to have low density to meet demand. There is demand for low density too, there are people who enjoy having a backyard and squirrels in their backyard. So those people are making a trade off and they know if they live in an individual house and they prefer it, they know that their bakery or their grocery store will be at 20 minutes, you know well they can use a bicycle for it if they want.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#076&quot; id=&quot;076&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But that's linked together, you cannot have a 15 minute city without dealing with supply and demand. So my problem with the planners is that it seems to say, well we are going to plan it that way. You don't plan it that way. And the same for schools, you know I was a... when I read the 15 minute city of Moreno there, I didn't know how schools were built in Paris, frankly. So I checked in it and it was very interesting. It seems that they are very competent civil servants because the schools are state run. By the way, not a municipality but the ministry of education. We are a centralized... you know, Louis XIV's country, we are very centralized. Those civil servants are very, very responsive, and you find more schools in denser neighborhoods of Paris and less school in neighborhood where people are aging. You know? There are much less children. They are very responsive and they close them and they open them depending on the change.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#077&quot; id=&quot;077&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So I was happily surprised here, they had some good... in a way they were doing good planning. So the 15 minute city. Now if you say, for instance, you should have, especially in the dense city, access to public transport within 15 minutes walk or I would say even 10 minutes walk, I completely agree with that but then you should have a program of that. This is not what Moreno is all about, Moreno's say we have a way, we're designing the city so you will find your job within 15 minutes. I believe that if you move to Sau Paolo or to Paris or to Shanghai it is not to take a job within 15 minutes. You select the best job in the entire metropolitan area for Sau Paolo and the employer is also looking for selecting the best person in the entire metropolitan. So this trade off has to be understood. A job is not an indifferent job, it's not one job. You have a choice and you should have a choice of many, many jobs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#078&quot; id=&quot;078&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Perfect, thank you, thank you Alain. So Maria asks a question about urban transformation in urban fringes. So when rural areas are subdivided into lots or maybe vacation homes are transformed into residential areas, excessively and intensively occupying areas that were once low density. I believe you mentioned some of this in your book about the value of land but maybe you can comment about this to answer her question.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#079&quot; id=&quot;079&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah I think that again here you have, let's say I simplify. We have two cases. Either the state will not intervene at all and you have spontaneous development but including spontaneous development of streets and major streets. When it's a small access street to a lot it doesn't matter. But let's say if you have new suburbs created in the fringe of a city, one of the most important things is that this new suburb has to be linked to the rest of the city because again, the people who are moving in this area are part of the labor market and they are going to have to work somewhere and not necessarily in their neighborhood, probably not in their neighborhood. So the state here has to intervene and it's a top down thing. To integrate this new neighborhood with a network of transport which links with the entire area of the city. This idea that the city could grow within a self-contained area, you know sometimes you have that in, for instance I've seen that in Korea where they build new cities and they think those new cities next to Seoul are going to be self contained, that people who live there will work there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#080&quot; id=&quot;080&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; It's not true. It's never happened that way. So you have to link, the state has to establish a link with the rest of the city. Now, that's done, the way that land is subdivided should be, again, entirely demand driven. Once you have ensured that you have set apart the space which will be not under the market which will be devoted to main streets the rest should be demand driven. The problem we have, either we have complete failure of the state who do not develop the infrastructure to link those neighborhoods to the rest of the city, then also you have what you call haphazard development. Which I don't believe, there is nothing really haphazard. You have all sort of building and in a way they respond better to demand because there is no regulation. But then they lack transport. So in the long run that will not be very good for the city. Or you have then the way many American cities or Europeans expand, you have an imposition in advance of one pattern, one type of density which is arbitrary. You don't know what will be the demand for, say, three story walk-up apartment compared to individual houses or townhouses. I think that you should have a type of regulation which should allow the consumer to make a choice to live in a suburb but live in a townhouse, rather than an individual.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#081&quot; id=&quot;081&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Or, on the contrary to live on a lot of a quarter of an hectare and let's see what happens. I don't see why the state should decide on the consumption of land in any area of the city. Engineers would tell you, ah, but the infrastructure is not there. The job of the state is to provide the infrastructure to support where the people are, not the opposite.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#082&quot; id=&quot;082&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; With this idea in mind do you think there is a tension between the necessity of the state to provide infrastructure to all areas? And the fact that an individual decision to move into the outskirts of an urban area will, let's say, create a public necessity right? At a higher cost.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#083&quot; id=&quot;083&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; I mean let's say, why will somebody go... the state could say, this is our plan for infrastructure in the future and we are going to expand. You will not get a road here before 10 years, that's possible. But if somebody, let's say, densify an area which is relatively far away from the border of the urban area. Again, you have to ask why would they do that? In a way it would be better for them to be closer, that will give more value. So why do they do that? Sometimes they do that because precisely, I've seen that a lot in India by the way, precisely their regulation at the fringe which oblige them to use more land than they wanted. Then they have to jump over... or sometimes you have a green belt, so on the side of the greenbelt the land is too expensive because they know it's a green belt, it's the last land left...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#084&quot; id=&quot;084&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So you have to find why the people do that. The idea that people are vicious and are building things in impossible places just to annoy planners is not true. Again very often, sometimes in The World Bank report you see haphazard development. Development which is not under control. I argue with that, any development which happens has it's reason and you have to find why it is there. It is to find cheaper land, why is land so expensive somewhere else? And maybe there are people who are poorer and they settle there precisely because they cannot afford land. So by preventing them from building them you don't make them richer. So how do those people want to participate in the labor market of the city, where do they settle?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#085&quot; id=&quot;085&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; In my book I gave the example, if I remember well, in Mexico City of an informal development on the slope of a volcano which probably should not be built, I agree. But you have to find out why will people build their informal settlement, accessible by motorcycle to the labor market of Mexico City. Why would they build there? If you prevent them from building there and you may have a good reason to do it, I'm not denying it. But then you have to provide an alternative thing so your reflex should not be to prevent things which you find disturbing, but to say why do people move there? Can we provide an alternative at the same price? So you have to monitor the price of this informal settlement and say, if they move closer to the city they have to consume much more land. Then you should have, closer to the city, the possibility of consuming very little land for these people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#086&quot; id=&quot;086&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So you have to look at the problem that way. The same way as when people want to close completely the city to cars you have to look, why somebody drives from Manhattan? It's not fun to drive through Manhattan, so why would they drive through Manhattan? And you have to find an alternative, could some of them be provided with an alternative to that? So again the idea that a city is made of people and you have to find out what is best for them rather than design the infrastructure and say the people have to adapt to my infrastructure because really this will be optimum if they do. Sorry, it was a long answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#087&quot; id=&quot;087&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; No, no problem. Do you have time for a couple more?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#088&quot; id=&quot;088&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes I have plenty of time, yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#089&quot; id=&quot;089&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Great. So we have two questions around this concept of infrastructure and informal housing. One of them is how to address urban areas that have been consolidated with, let's say, favelas and the urban expansion was unplanned. What is the best benchmarks to bring infrastructure to these areas? And another question by [Chris Journey 01:01:43] is, what about areas that maybe are environmentally sensitive areas? We have in Brazil for example houses above lakes or rivers. Do we bring infrastructure to these communities or are these cases where a relocation would be justified?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#090&quot; id=&quot;090&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes. So the first question, it's possible... so area which are already densified, let's say favelas and surrounding area. I think that one of the main problems here is, again, to link those areas with the rest of the city in terms of first providing basic infrastructure. I don't think, by the way, especially in a tropical country or a warm country that housing is as important as infrastructure. So the best thing you can do, in my opinion in a favella, is to bring infrastructure, you know clean water and also the possibility of moving through the favela relatively fast and to access public transport. It might not be possible within the favela to provide it, but say at the fringe of the favela. I think that's the most important thing. So it is possible that in some areas you may have to do a Haussmann operation. In order to link, again, this large area... I can think of that in some area of Mexico City where you have large areas, very dense population and most of the streets are about six to eight meters, no more than six meters. Those people are penalized by lack of access of the large labor market of Mexico City.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#091&quot; id=&quot;091&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So you may have to have a Haussmann operation here and again, you will have to do it not by cutting a street but probably also relocating people on site by doing a real estate operation at the same time, you know? Not concentrate on the street so that people are relocated on site and that will be part of the cost of the street in a way but you will create wealth at the same time. You create fixed capital. So it's a bit complicated, I'd rather discuss that maybe on a drawing or on a map but that I think... the linkage of a poor area with the rest of the labor market by fast transport is very, very important. Very poor people who cannot afford transport very often are very limited to taking jobs relatively close to where they live, then their salaries are much lower because of that and they have much less also possibility. You know you learn a lot on the job and they have less possibility of learning on the job. So I think that easy access to the rest of the labor market is very important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#092&quot; id=&quot;092&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; The other question, environmentally sensitive areas. Now there are two possibilities. Either it's area which will always be flood or are necessarily because of... so again if people settle there, certainly it's not because they enjoy spoiling the environment there, it's because it's the only cheap land. So can you provide somewhere, land which is as cheap and is as well located, the question is that. If you don't you expel the people from this area but you have not solved any problem. The area looks better without the slum on it and maybe even ducks will be there or something, it will be very nice. But what about those people? Those people will be worse off. So you have absolutely to find an alternative solution. Don't forget that if they go there it's not because they are ignorant or anything it's because they look around their entire city and they find this. Although maybe they are flooded all the time, maybe they are full of mosquitoes and things like that, not very comfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#093&quot; id=&quot;093&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; But they found that from their point of view this is the best place in the city, so can you find for people like that with this income something which is equivalent and which is not in a sensitive area? So that's the thing. Now, in some area, I remember a case in India where there was a large slum on an area which was regularly flooded and again, the people knew it was flooded. But because it was flooded the land was cheap and that's why they settled there. It was relatively close, they have a good access to the city center through this area. So the city first decided to remove them and put them somewhere far away from the city, where in fact they were relatively close. Then we found if you have a good engineer, we found that by building a [bunt 01:06:29] around this area in fact it will be much cheaper to prevent this area from flooding without relocating people and bringing clean water and a system to remove garbage from this area and things like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#094&quot; id=&quot;094&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So that was also done quite a number of times in Indonesia in the Kampung project that I speak about. So again here you should see if some civil work will not solve the problem of flooding, for instance. If the area is not otherwise sensitive. But some area should stay wet, you know? If they're a wetland or things like that, I have no problem with that obviously. Or say, the slope of the volcano around Mexico City probably should not be built because of the difficulty, the drainage problem that it causes and things like that. So here you have to... but always think. You know the problem sometimes when you address this is to beautify the area and kick the people out and these people are not going to disappear, they are not going to go back to their village, they are going to go somewhere else in the city and create another problem so unless you address the problem of the people, in particular affordability. Land affordability and access to jobs, you are not going to solve the problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/5f0dbcd7-f99c-4d22-b6ab-3f04b2fc7d96.jpg&quot; width=&quot;158&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/e64d57c3-b491-4983-82ae-68c13c663b3e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;190&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Flash floods in Jakarta's kampungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#095&quot; id=&quot;095&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Amazing, amazing answer, thank you Alain. I think we have a couple of last other questions. Andrea says that there is a 2004 paper in which you explain that the city of Bangalore restricted FAR in central areas because they believed it would be too costly to build infrastructure large enough to accommodate a large population. Of course this caused the population to spread outwards which increased the demand for infrastructure. Do you know of any cities where this density restriction, because of financial concerns, would make sense? And he believes that many people in Brazil argue against density saying that the cost of improving infrastructure would be too high.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#096&quot; id=&quot;096&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Look, it's very simple. Look at the cost of land and look at the cost of infrastructure and very often to save, say $10 million in infrastructure, you blow up $100 million of real estate. So there could be a situation where infrastructure in some area is so expensive because, I don't know, mud maybe or earthquake or something. But my experience is always that infrastructure is, when there is demand by the way. The problem is that sometimes planners build infrastructure in the middle of nowhere where there is no demand, then the infrastructure becomes, indeed, very expensive because there is no demand for it. But if you are in a downtown area or say suburban area where there is a lot of demand for housing or whatever, office building, my experience is that it's always cheaper to bring pipes there or to increase the sewer system and things like that. Look at cities like Manhattan or Paris, they had no infrastructure, the infrastructure was built little by little. If Manhattan had decided gee, in the 19th century they had no sewer by the way, so we don't want to spend on infrastructure, the city should expand or you should move to Baltimore or something like that, it doesn't make sense.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#097&quot; id=&quot;097&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; You have to adapt. The problem of course is very often you do not have mechanisms to recover the cost of infrastructure so you have a municipal budget for sewers and you have no mechanism to get it back and it's possible if you increase density you have something like an impact fee or something which will pay for that additional infrastructure. Or you have the system that you have in Texas where you have bonds which are repaid by property tax in the long run. But there you need a relatively sophisticated financial system of course to do that. So I think that it's not that infrastructure is too costly when there is demand for area, it's just that you have no mechanism to recover the cost of infrastructure. You know, it comes from one pocket where the money's going in another pocket, so you don't do it. I cannot imagine a case where there is a high demand for infrastructure where the price of the real estate will not largely compensate the cost of infrastructure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#098&quot; id=&quot;098&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Alain, your answer was on point as I think our last question was exactly on this topic. So Arthur asks about Latin American cities with budget constraints and how could infrastructure be provided. You gave us some light on it already. What do you think about selling building rights, other finance mechanisms cities could use.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#099&quot; id=&quot;099&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, let's say... the problem of course when it's the government who sell it, all to establish a price which would kill the market, because you could price it in such a way that it doesn't kill the market, then nothing happens. I think that now if we talk about Brazil there is a financial system in Brazil which is deep enough to be able to finance cities. Cities I'm sure are able to issue bonds, for most cities, and probably this is the best way to finance. This means that you have a property tax or some income which will guarantee the bonds of course, on which the bonds will be placed. So I'm not really an expert on municipal finance, frankly, but it is true that the financing of infrastructure is a very important thing and very often cities are broke. When in fact you look at the price of real estate in the city you don't have the feeling that people are broke, after all if they pay this amount for real estate there is money circulating there and there is no doubt they should pay for infrastructure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#100&quot; id=&quot;100&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; I think that one example, again I'm not an expert on that, but one example that I find very convincing is what is used in Texas. I think it's called MUD, municipal urban district, and it's a way of issuing bonds which do not necessarily cover a specific... it can go over even several municipalities. But the bond covers the infrastructure. So when you are in a suburban area you have a district, the district is specific to the infrastructure which may go across several suburban boundaries. And this seems to work very well and that explains in large part why housing in general in Texas is much cheaper than in other parts of the United States. Because of those bonds you are able to develop enough infrastructure to... and by the way, they also, in the city of Houston, they revise periodically also now the land use so that they increase sometimes density if they feel there is a demand for smaller apartments or smaller plots, they are able to do that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#101&quot; id=&quot;101&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; One of our supporters Eric just messaged us saying that municipalities are restricted from issuing bonds in Brazil.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#102&quot; id=&quot;102&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Oh really? Ah yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#103&quot; id=&quot;103&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#104&quot; id=&quot;104&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Because the state do not think that they are able to repay them, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#105&quot; id=&quot;105&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Maybe, maybe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#106&quot; id=&quot;106&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; So maybe there are other mechanisms than bonds but I think that when cities are able to issue bonds and they know that they will not be bailed out by the state, I think that might be the best, look maybe I'm biased, again I'm not an expert on municipal finance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#107&quot; id=&quot;107&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; There is an instrument in Brazil which I find interesting that cities can specify an urban area and they sell building rights and with the proceeds they will invest in that urban area and the price is not set nominally by city hall, it's an auction and these building rights titles are sold in the open market, so that's an interesting way to avoid the price definition.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#108&quot; id=&quot;108&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah, that's interesting. And I suppose that in those areas then they establish also standards of urbanization, right? Because the building rights are based on the private parts of the development, obviously.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#109&quot; id=&quot;109&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#110&quot; id=&quot;110&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes it's a bit like what Hong Kong used to do, I'm not so sure now in the last three years, if they skipped doing it. But that's Hong Kong used to do in the past to develop and that's why you had suburbs in Hong Kong with very high densities because that's what people were ready to pay to get as close as possible to the center of Hong Kong and to public transport. Because with the density of Hong Kong, Hong Kong can function only for about 80% of people who use public transport. Let's say about 500, 600 people per hectare. So yes, that's a solution. I had a case, strangely enough in Iran, I work in Iran after the revolution, and there was a mayor of Tehran who was desperate for money and to respond, again, to density. He did exactly that, he auctioned the rights to build and he financed infrastructure like that and the central government was critical of it but I look at the outcome of it when I was there and I felt it was... it's a little primitive, let's say, but it works in producing an enormous amount of floor space which was obviously affordable because it was all private.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/b26d97a3-1d83-436a-bad7-159e6d1efa51/158e5b8c-3902-4308-9405-313bbe472309.jpg&quot; width=&quot;216&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#111&quot; id=&quot;111&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; People are always asking for a compact city. It created a compact city by itself without having to regulate it or things like that. And the fact that it was auctioned, if it was set by the government you will always expect  that there would be an area where there is no demand and they put a very high price but here it was obviously demand driven. So again, being demand driven is very important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#112&quot; id=&quot;112&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; I'm personally surprised about these mechanisms because with all of the density restrictions most big cities are sitting on a pile of cash, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#113&quot; id=&quot;113&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Yes, yes, exactly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#114&quot; id=&quot;114&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; They could easily finance themselves in many different ways.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#115&quot; id=&quot;115&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; A guy like Trump, the way he made some of the money was to buy land in Manhattan which was zoned for industry or something like that. The steel industry land in Manhattan and they thought you will be crazy to create an industry in Manhattan. So this land has very little value, it's used usually for storage. And if you know how to change, so you buy it, if you know how to change it so it has a potential value of hundreds of millions of dollars but you buy it for $50 million. You wait, it takes maybe 10 years with very expensive lawyers to change the zoning if you know... I'm not implying corruption even, just a process you know? The board president, the community, whatever. After 10 years suddenly it becomes commercial or residential and you have made a bundle. But it all goes to the developer and the lawyers because you have to have very skilled lawyers to do that. But the city was sitting on it and not doing anything with it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#116&quot; id=&quot;116&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, yeah. And the cities have a lot to learn with real estate developers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#117&quot; id=&quot;117&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Why do New York maintain manufacturing in Manhattan where there is no demand for manufacturing? Again, some people believe that manufacturing jobs could come back to Manhattan and that you will have... so the union, a number of people believe, well if we maintain them then we will have good jobs, manufacturing, instead of having only services. I mean it's a myth, it will not not happen. It just transfers money from the city to developers and lawyers. I apologize for the lawyers here. I have great respect for zoning lawyers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#118&quot; id=&quot;118&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; Well, that's fine, that's fine. Alain, we're passed the time we had scheduled, but it was a great pleasure to talk to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#119&quot; id=&quot;119&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain:&lt;/a&gt; Same here, thank you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#120&quot; id=&quot;120&quot;class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Anthony:&lt;/a&gt; We're done with questions for now, but I don't want to take too much of your time. It's always an honor to connect with you and we have many big fans of your work here with us, so thank you.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;While the startup cities industry is still small, it is already quite heterogeneous. Each project has its own distinct set of goals, motivations, and scope. However, this diversity isn’t fully captured by the vocabulary we use right now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To help myself create a mental map of the industry, I’ve grouped these motivations into 5 categories. I’ve also included examples of places that personify each motivation. (Some of those examples wouldn’t self-identify as &quot;startup cities&quot; but to me embody that spirit nonetheless.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These motivations aren’t necessarily incompatible with each other. In fact, they're generally symbiotic, and I suspect most startup cities are motivated by many or all of them. The question is one of priority. Which of these goals is a project's main attractor for residents? Which are desirable but not central to the project's mission? The answers to those questions will determine the trade-offs each startup city will make.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I’m publishing this ontology for three reasons. I hope to:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Create shared vocabulary so builders can communicate clearly with their residents, investors, team, and other stakeholders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Encourage builders to sharpen their focus on what they’re trying to do… and explicitly recognize what they’re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;trying to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Receive feedback about this list so that I can sharpen my own mental model about how various projects in the space relate to one another. I write to learn!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So let’s have at it! Here are the different categories of answers I’ve heard to the question &quot;What are startup cities for?&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Economic opportunity&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Competitive governance&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Technological experimentation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Economic opportunity:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Unleash economic development, reducing poverty and unemployment.

For example, Próspera has something called a &quot;snap referendum&quot;: any council action can be vetoed by popular referendum within 14 days, giving residents more sovereignty over their community than any other jurisdiction in Honduras. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I think of this as redesigning the law with &quot;user experience&quot; in mind, which is not legislators' typical framing when they write laws.&lt;/div&gt;

After the cloud community successfully negotiates with a host government, they migrate there en masse. Balaji describes it like this: &quot;If you can get 100k people in the cloud, making $100k annually each, you can simultaneously negotiate with 50 governments to legalize self-driving cars. Cloud first, land last.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;These field notes are a bit different from &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/tag/city-reviews&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;previous cities I've explored&lt;/a&gt;, because unlike those, Miami is my home! So this post partially serves as a life update—I moved to Miami Beach from California a few months ago, and I'm excited to share my explorations with you.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/miamicityflorida,miamidadecountyflorida/PST045219&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;58% of the city is foreign born&lt;/a&gt;, but more than that, when you talk to people in the street or in cafes there's this palpable sense that they made an active choice to be here because they thought it would create opportunities for themselves and their children to lead better lives. In a lot of cases, these are people who risked a lot to make that choice, and they've come here because they believe in American principles and the way we do things (or at least what we strive for).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don't get me wrong, America has a lot of problems, but spending time with the people here who've left Cuba or Venezuela or Haiti or some other part of the world to make the USA their home is a reminder of what makes America special. There's nothing like spending time with immigrants to make you proud of your country.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0 !important&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/a7905cf0-3085-4318-9d87-d1f62c85344b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 3142; --en-naturalHeight: 2356;&quot; width=&quot;54px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/51b20951-14b5-453a-a057-f758d7eb00bd.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 3142; --en-naturalHeight: 2356;&quot; width=&quot;54px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Oh so flamboyant:&lt;/span&gt; Paul Graham talks about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;cities whisper different things into your ear&lt;/a&gt;, and Miami's whisper is very, very different from SF and NYC (the two cities I'm most familiar with). SF is all about having the longest lever* on an important problem that you can get. NYC whispers lots of different things depending on what circles you're in, but the whisper I personally hear from NYC is that I should be more cool and interesting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami seems to whisper to people that you should be entertaining and flamboyant. This takes a lot of different forms. The most visible ones are the party girls walking to the beach with stiletto heels and the macho guys revving the Lamborghinis they rented for the day. The way it's manifested for me personally is that I suddenly have a massive urge to get good at rollerskating so that I can bop around the Miami Beach boardwalk with all of the other people wearing brightly colored skates dancing to bubblegum pop music.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;* Paul describes this as &quot;power&quot;, but I like the lever analogy more because it emphasizes the technological aspects of it. Power is too broad—it can include coercion, and that's frowned upon in SF, but gaining power through smarts and invention is celebrated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Street conversations: &lt;/span&gt;Miamians talk to you on the street casually, just like we're all friends hanging out and enjoying life side by side. This is not the norm in SF so it's taken some getting used to, but I love it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In SF, I quickly learned that if a stranger approaches you on the street you should be careful—this is partially because it's not part of the culture for normal people to talk to you on the street, and partially because there is a lot of homelessness and crime and so talking to strangers on the street is a bit unsafe. (My default is to be really chatty with people on the street, and that has bit me in the past in SF. 😞)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Miami by contrast, people strike up conversations with strangers all the time, even just in passing. I've had more street conversations here during a pandemic than I had in SF before Covid happened!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Endlessly entertaining:&lt;/span&gt; People here are just plain funny! It feels like Miami just doesn't take itself as seriously as other cities, so people are more fun and laid back. This shows up in all sorts of places, from how people dress to the names of restaurants. It also shows up in the architecture, which I'll get to in the next bullet point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My favorite manifestation is that on the boardwalk, it's extremely common to see people running or biking by with headphones on and belting out a pop song as they zoom by you. They seem to be having an absolute blast, and they're generally very fit too. Hey, if singing Rihanna's Umbrella at the top of your lungs motivates you to exercise more, then I'm all for it!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One word for whatever this is is &quot;shamelessness&quot;, but that has a bit too much of a negative, moralistic connotation for my liking. Many of the ridiculous activities people do here in Miami aren't quite my style, but I'm extremely happy that they exist around me because they are extremely entertaining and seem to bring joy to the people who partake in them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then, one of the excitedly looked at the others and said &quot;Butts? Butts!&quot;, and the whole group of girls flipped around and started taking pictures of their butts. It may have been the funniest thing I'd ever seen and I've been quoting it constantly since then.&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The next time I went to the beach, I saw another group of girls ask a separate group of guys—who I'm pretty sure they didn't know before this—to take pictures of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; butts. One of the guys happily obliged. Since the photography was just a 1-man job, his friend then jumped into the picture frame and started grabbing the girls' butts as they shook them for the photo. The girls seemed to be thrilled with this and started posing even more wildly for the camera. Miami is endlessly entertaining. (Photo above)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is best illustrated by Miami's sometimes whacky architecture, but also shows up in things like Covid restrictions being lifted sooner than other major cities. This is related to #5 above, probably in a self-reinforcing loop.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It feels like the zoning is less strict here than in SF. In any given neighborhood in central Miami, you get tall buildings, short buildings, medium buildings—building heights are all over the map. Even the historically-protected Art Deco District in Miami Beach has some tall buildings. The buildings you do get are also weirder (which to me is a good thing).&lt;/div&gt;

I was there for dinner one night, and when trying to leave the hotel I accidentally went through the back doors rather than the front doors. I looked up in the darkness, and there was a shining gold mammoth fossil gleaming down on me. I almost didn't fully register what I was seeing for a few seconds.&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I vote that when Stewart Brand successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://longnow.org/seminars/02013/may/21/reviving-extinct-species/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;revives the woolly mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, he should host its launch party in the FAENA gardens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/47107686-2eaa-41f4-bf4f-c061ba5191fc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 2800; --en-naturalHeight: 2154;&quot; width=&quot;54px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I've been exploring the various terraces, cafes, and pool decks within the high-end hotels along the beach and camping out at them as my office in the afternoons. They generally have great wifi, too!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Culture War armistice:&lt;/span&gt; Over the past few years, it's become increasingly difficult to escape a certain type of confrontational, polarized politics which a lot of people call the Culture War. I have major issues with both sides of this &quot;war&quot;, and yet I'm often faced with a &quot;you're either with us or against us&quot; framing from both. It's exhausting and intellectually suffocating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami is a breath of fresh air. Among the people I've met here, there's a much greater level of civility and tolerance of others' viewpoints. My guess is that the diverse political viewpoints in Florida mean that Floridians have realized that (a) people who have different views aren't always immoral, stupid, or inhuman and (b) they have no choice but to find a way to live with each other, because no single political group is a clear majority in Miami.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Caveat: I've only been here 2.5 months and it's not like I've met a random sampling of the population, so I'm sure this is not the universal experience of Miami. I'm talking only about &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; experience.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's one illustration of what I mean: a friend who's lived in Miami for 3 years recently pointed out that he couldn't tell whether the mayor, Francis Suarez, was a Democrat or a Republican until he looked it up on his Wikipedia page. The Cuban-descended mayor is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynZYrc2tilI&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;pro-immigration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://miamilgbtnews.wordpress.com/2018/04/15/saves-business-equality-network-promotes-workplace-uniformity/&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;pro-LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt;, but at the same time he's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/francissuarez/status/1335037068108554241&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;business-friendly&lt;/a&gt; and tough on crime. He doesn't fit cleanly into left-right binary the country has tied itself up into. It turns out that Mayor Francis Suarez is a member of the Republican party, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/miami-mayor-suarez-gop-issues-evolve-90974b24-937e-4054-b934-2e11c7494995.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;he's not your typical Republican&lt;/a&gt; by any means. (This is a description, not an endorsement.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fact that Miami elected someone with Suarez's background (and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_X._Suarez&quot;&gt;86% of the vote&lt;/a&gt;!) is meaningful to me—it's impossible to imagine someone like him winning a major political office in San Francisco, because his platform doesn't cleanly fit into a narrow range of acceptable viewpoints. More likely, he'd be deplatformed or booed offstage before he could even get to parts of his platform that would be popular, even though he's really quite centrist when placed on a conventional right-left US political continuum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25);&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn't just about Mayor Suarez. Since WWII, Miami's mayors have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Miami&quot;&gt;alternated&lt;/a&gt; between Democrats and Republicans mostly evenly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I realize that being surrounded by heterogenous political ideas isn't seen as a plus for everyone. I know lots of people who've chosen to move to places specifically because the government and culture match their values as closely as possible (e.g. a Republican moving to a conservative town or a Democrat moving to a blue county). I think that's a totally valid choice, it's just not my personal preference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Pro-business: &lt;/span&gt;Miami is unabashedly pro-entrepreneur and pro-business. The city government, the culture, and the tax rates are very welcoming of people who want to start and run companies. This is important to me because I believe that businesses are one of the biggest ways to create opportunities and wealth for a community (with some caveats, of course).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This business-friendly attitude seems deeply ingrained in Miami's DNA, and I have two guesses as to why:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/not-just-cubans-many-latinos-now-call-miami-home-n37241&quot;&gt;54% of the population is Cuban-descended&lt;/a&gt;, and they saw firsthand how Communism ruined their country's economy. They chose to come to America because it celebrates the role that business plays in society.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stateofflorida.com/taxes/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20personal%20income,sales%20tax%20rate%20is%206%25&quot;&gt;Florida has a 0% income tax&lt;/a&gt;, and that attracts people who are more likely to value small government, which also correlates with being pro-business (though admittedly it also correlates with other attributes I don't value 😛).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Plants, plants everywhere!&lt;/span&gt; Miami is so lush. Every day I look outside my window at palm trees, birds of paradise, and bright pink blooming flowers, and I just can't get enough of it. The gorgeous tree canopy almost makes Miami's infamous heat a lot easier to bear than you might expect. Personally, I'd prefer to walk in tropical Miami under giant banyan trees in 95℉ weather than in dry Los Angeles under the direct sun.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#expectation-v-reality&quot; id=&quot;expectation-v-reality&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; II. Expectation vs reality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of my goals with these field notes is to break down misconceptions about Miami that I myself had before coming here. I'd thought that Miami was a soulless sea of glass buildings with penthouses filled with people snorting cocaine. I'd been warned that it was an extremely car-centric city with little street life, and that the humidity was so suffocating that you could barely walk from your front door to your car without breathing a sigh of relief as soon as your air conditioning began to wash over you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These stereotypes aren't &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;—I'm confident you can find cocaine if you're looking for it, and that the August weather will indeed be suffocating—but they capture just a tiny sliver of what Miami is about. My experience of this city has been completely different.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper no-shadow&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: -16px !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/d501bc30-ecec-483a-b092-eeecbad900d7.png&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 2024; --en-naturalHeight: 1012;&quot; width=&quot;299&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's my slice of Miami: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wake up every morning with birds chirping and sunshine streaming through my window, filtered by palm trees and a massive bird of paradise just outside my window. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I live in a charming 4-unit building with a cute shared courtyard, and my unit has a front yard all to its own. There's almost no street noise, so I can hear the parrots chirping as I make my morning coffee. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm in walking distance to a gorgeous outdoor pool, a Whole Foods, the beach, dozens of cafes and restaurants, and the boardwalk. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I want to go into downtown, I take a bus that runs so often that I don't even know how long the interval is, because all I need to know is it'll show up frequently enough that I don't have to think about it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In short, my life is filled with sunshine, walking, quiet, and easy access to transit. The stereotypes I had of Miami certainly exist, but they are not overpowering by any means.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 50, 169);&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/33029580-9bb5-4a51-a1e9-41aeb5814071.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 540; --en-naturalHeight: 540;&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(135, 0, 79);&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/c291c05f-942b-4aa8-9c6e-559eeae3b463.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 4368; --en-naturalHeight: 2204;&quot; width=&quot;110&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(135, 0, 79);&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/7055d3f6-51b0-4511-b76b-962e4d03ca0f.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 3141; --en-naturalHeight: 2356;&quot; width=&quot;62&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(135, 0, 79);&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/e33a6bb7-0a31-4915-873d-6a6ea3bd9cd1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth: 2730; --en-naturalHeight: 2048;&quot; width=&quot;72&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(135, 0, 79);&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So it might be surprising to learn that this cute little existence is right in the heart of Miami Beach. Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/miami-beach-declares-state-emergency-over-spring-break-crowds-n1261673&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;that Miami Beach&lt;/a&gt;. If you didn't see the recent news, Miami Beach recently rejuvenated its reputation as Spring Break capital of the world by instating an emergency curfew in response to out of control parties. (Yes, during a pandemic... 🤦‍♀️) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This doesn't exactly square up with my peaceful, almost village-like lifestyle that I described above. The key thing is that this Spring Break sliver of Miami Beach is entirely avoidable. Ocean Drive is where most of the debauchery in Miami Beach occurs, and if you stay way from that strip then you'll be able to avoid it entirely. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Many people associate Miami Beach with Spring Break and other drunken degeneracy because (a) they've never actually been or (b) when they visited, they primarily hung out along Ocean Drive, which is the capital of Spring Break. I personally only experience the Ocean Drive party scene when I feel in the mood for some people watching (my favorite kind of entertainment), but otherwise it doesn't intersect with my daily life much at all. It's not nearly as all-encompassing of life in Miami Beach as people assume.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Neighborhoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Miami has lots of other kinds of neighborhoods as well, and the Spring Break stereotypes of Miami are even less of a match to those than to my slice of Miami Beach. Here's a sampler of the neighborhoods I've explored so far:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Brickell &amp; Edgewater:&lt;/span&gt; For those gleaming towers with fancy amenities, you can live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brickell&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Brickell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewater_(Miami)&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;Edgewater&lt;/a&gt;. Most of Miami's real estate development in the past few decades has happened in these neighborhoods rather than downtown Miami, and I've been told that this is because there are a few families who own large swathes of downtown and they weren't interested in developing it. I'm interested to verify this information and to learn more about it, if anyone knows more about it!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While Little Havana is really a mix of lots of Caribbean, Central American, and South American communities, Little Haiti has a larger majority of Haitians.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Walking around Little Haiti I definitely got some confused looks that seemed to say &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; People were very friendly and welcoming, but they just seemed confused by my presence. I got a strong sense that non-Haitians aren't typical customers at Haitian businesses in that part of town.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example we went to a restaurant around 11am, and my friend (who admires Haitian culture a lot and has spent a fair bit of time there) asked them what they had on the menu. The woman said &quot;It's soup time. We only have soup,&quot; but then asked, &quot;But are you sure you want this?&quot; with the implication that it might be too exotic for our palettes or something. He said &quot;Yes I'm sure&quot; and ordered 3 bowls, 1 for each of us. But then she only brought out 1 and said, &quot;Try it first to make sure you like it&quot;. As we tried a sip, she had the most worried look on her face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But she had nothing to worry about! The soup was tasty! And really it wasn't strange at all, in fact it tasted very familiar, like chicken soup almost. When we confirmed that we liked it and ordered more, she chuckled but also seemed like she wasn't quite sure she believed that we actually liked it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#FAQs&quot; id=&quot;FAQs&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; IV.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;FAQs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: How is Miami's infrastructure and transit? Is it super car-centric?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I’m based in Miami Beach, an island off the coast which is quite different from Miami mainland. Miami Beach is super walkable. I don’t have a car, and I have a Whole Foods, beautiful public pool, lots of cafes, and so on within 8 minutes walking from my place. There's also a boardwalk running trail nearby which is also gorgeous, and there's a pedestrian-friendly street called Española Way with lots of restaurants.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/344b5576-49aa-436b-8154-3e22c6caae06.jpg&quot; style=&quot;--en-naturalWidth:1920; --en-naturalHeight:1080;&quot; width=&quot;179&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Miami mainland is more varied depending where you are. The Brickell neighborhood is a bit like Midtown Manhattan; super dense, but in my opinion not that pleasant to walk. The Design District and Wynwood are a bit like the Mission in SF; walkable but a bit spread out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Most of the rest of the city is very car-centered I think though. I haven’t explored the other parts so much so I can’t speak to that as much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;TLDR there are definitely some very walkable parts of Miami, though I think the median experience of the city if you just picked at totally random spot on the map would be very car-dependent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: How bad was it to live in Miami Beach during Spring Break?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To be honest, I didn't really notice it until my mom texted me &quot;Are you okay?!?!&quot; and shared a CNN article about how Miami Beach had declared a state of emergency due to the Spring Breakers. I'm sure if I had gone for a late-night walk along Ocean Drive I would've noticed more of what was going on, but where I live in the middle of the island (which is a few blocks away from Ocean Drive) I noticed almost nothing. The only part that really impacted me was the 8pm curfew they put in place going in and out of Miami Beach, because I decided not to go to dinner with a friend on the mainland for fear of not being able to get back home, which was certainly inconvenient but not the end of the world. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: What should I read/watch to get a taste of Miami without actually going there?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm only going to give one answer rather than inundating you in recommendations, in hopes that you actually watch it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Burn-Notice-Season-1/dp/B0011NLF4U?sa-no-redirect=1&quot;&gt;Burn Notice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Burn-Notice-Season-1/dp/B0011NLF4U?sa-no-redirect=1&quot;&gt;Burn Notice&lt;/a&gt; about a CIA agent whose identity was compromised so he gets stuck in Miami. He goes about the city helping little old ladies and other nice people solve impossible missions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My favorite part is that the main character narrates throughout the show, so you learn how to tail people without being noticed and build makeshift listening devices and that sort of thing. It's also a great way to explore Miami vicariously, because they shot the show in lots of different locations throughout the city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25);&quot;&gt;You can watch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Burn-Notice-Season-1/dp/B0011NLF4U?sa-no-redirect=1&quot; style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple;&quot;&gt;Burn Notice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color: simple; color: rgb(25, 25, 25);&quot;&gt;for free with Amazon Prime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: Mosquitos/bugs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I haven't noticed many bugs here in Miami Beach at all, which is super surprising since it's a tropical environment. The Miami area in general apparently has a lot of mosquitoes (though I haven't experienced them firsthand), but Miami Beach itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g34438-i92-k11345438-Mosquitoes-Miami_Florida.html&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;sprays larvicide on the streets&lt;/a&gt; so there aren't many mosquitoes here. I've gotten few bug and mosquito bites in the months I've gotten here, but it's not a constant nuisance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: Weather?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I can't really answer this yet, because I've only been here during the winter and spring. During that time, the weather has been gorgeous and not too hot. The summer and fall will be less comfortable, especially during hurricane season (June 1 - Nov 30), but I can't speak to that from firsthand experience just yet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Q: Miscellaneous facts, observations, and pointers I've picked up along that way:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ontheworldmap.com/usa/city/miami/miami-south-beach-bike-map.jpg&quot;&gt;Here's a nice map&lt;/a&gt; of cycling routes in Miami.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/c6d83ee5-02fc-4ecb-8765-7aa5753437d0.png&quot; width=&quot;171&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;People text and drive in Miami more than any other place I've seen. I don't have stats on this, but it's hard to miss when you're walking around because people roll through stop signs while reading their phones constantly. It's honestly terrifying but also impressive how pervasive it is. The best was an Uber driver I had who was watching a rave on his phone while driving. (Photo to the right; sorry it's so blurry.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Demographics of Miami City and Miami-Dade County:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami City's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/miamicityflorida,miamidadecountyflorida/PST045219&quot; rev=&quot;en_rl_none&quot;&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; is 58% foreign born, 72% Hispanic, and 54% Cuban.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida#2010_U.S._Census&quot;&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, the largest ancestry groups in Miami-Dade County were:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;34.3% Cuban&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;4.6% Colombian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;4.5% Haitian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;4.2% Nicaraguan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;3.7% Puerto Rican&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;3.4% American&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.3% Dominican&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.3% German&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.2% Italian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.2% Honduran&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.1% Mexican&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.9% Venezuelan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.8% Irish&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.6% Peruvian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.5% English&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.4% Jamaican&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.1% Argentine&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.0% Russian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami Beach is famous for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Our-Community-Cats.html?soid=1123261919652&amp;aid=13Pn9fwLMLs&quot;&gt;street cats&lt;/a&gt; who roam the island. I don't think it's possible to spend more than a few hours exploring Miami Beach without crossing paths with at least one of them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami Beach also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://travellingbanana.com/the-wild-green-parrots-of-miami-beach/&quot;&gt;adorable wild parakeets&lt;/a&gt; that migrate to Miami in early spring and tend to disappear around November.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;What's the story behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gobrightline.com/homepage&quot;&gt;BrightLine&lt;/a&gt;, Florida's privately-run high speed passenger rail? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;How do places like Miami Beach and Hialeah coordinate with Miami? My understanding is that they are separate entities from Miami City, but they feel like a fairly cohesive unit to me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;What are the de jure and de facto structures of government for Miami? Where does the power for various decision reside?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8c3611c8-217f-4a0a-968d-99fd0b9c524c/f5c5ea8f-5252-4341-80f9-40330b67dc2a.png&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The reported crime rates in Miami Beach are similar or worse to SF, but it feels much, much safer here and no one has bars on their windows. It just doesn't add up to me. What's going on?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My best guesses are that (a) a lot of crimes occur in nightclubs but not in the neighborhood area where I live and (b) crimes may be under-reported in SF because it's widely believed that enforcement is lax.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miami has a lot of practice in disaster response because of the hurricanes that ravage the coast every few years. I've only heard positive things from the locals about how the municipality helps prepare for hurricanes. Did that expertise transfer over to the early COVID response?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why does Meridian Avenue in South Beach between 1st and 14th have so many more trees than any other continuous street? It's glorious.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color:  simple; color: rgb(140, 140, 140); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;As usual, the conversation traveled far and wide across the globe. We talked about Bolivian intersections, Japanese trains, French jets, Thai motorbikes, German cars, Swiss crosswalks, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color:  simple; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(140, 140, 140);&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000015&quot; id=&quot;000015&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:00:15):&lt;/a&gt; Hello, and welcome to the fourth episode of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Order Without Design&lt;/span&gt;. I'm Devon, and in this series I get to talk about cities with the most interesting couple I know, Alain and Marie-Agnes. In our last conversation, we talked about sanitation and public health. It included astonishing stories of their experience with these systems, in the dozens of cities where they've lived and worked.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000036&quot; id=&quot;000036&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:00:36):&lt;/a&gt; One highlight was when Alain recounted the time that he had his appendix removed in Yemen, and discovered that the doctor had run out of Novocaine. Anyways, I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you haven't heard that episode I highly recommend it. Today we'll talk about transportation. Since thes have lived and worked in so many cities around the world, they have a broad and deep perspective on the factors that affect how transportation systems function in different contexts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000102&quot; id=&quot;000102&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:01:02):&lt;/a&gt; So for the first question, some countries are notorious for reckless driving. They treat stop signs as suggestions rather than a rule. The drivers will weave in and out of lanes without signaling. Meanwhile, other countries have a reputation for extremely cautious drivers. What's the cause of this huge difference?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000120&quot; id=&quot;000120&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:01:20):&lt;/a&gt; I think it's not regulations, it is norms. People in some countries, respect rules by tradition, and other do not. The rules of the road, are about the same in  every country. In some countries there is, maybe, a complete distrust of government. I'm thinking of probably one of the worst type of traffic I've seen, is in Egypt. In Cairo,  but also in Egypt, in general. And I think that it comes from a mistrust of government, that everything government does is suspect of corruption.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/a47954d4-0a98-4e2a-bdd3-0299c2965c77.jpg&quot; width=&quot;126&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;The streets of Cairo, Egypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/84735f7e-a484-4325-b753-d161a2ae36b0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;146&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;A highway in Singapore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000159&quot; id=&quot;000159&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:01:59):&lt;/a&gt; It could be also that in countries that have been occupied for a long time by foreigners, people have less confidence in government than in countries which have been self-governing. And Egypt, maybe people do not remember that, but the last time Egypt were governed by Egyptians were by the pharaohs before Ptolemies, and then the next time was when Nasser took over from King Farouk, I think, in 1956 or something like that.  King Farouk was imposed by the British in Egypt . And he was originally an Albanian, so he was not an Egyptian.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000242&quot; id=&quot;000242&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:02:42):&lt;/a&gt; So I think that if you are governed by a foreign power, anything you do against the rule of the foreign power is patriotic, and you are encouraged to break the rules. And I think that breaking  driving rules is a bit like that, I think.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000258&quot; id=&quot;000258&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:02:58):&lt;/a&gt; That's super interesting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000300&quot; id=&quot;000300&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:03:00):&lt;/a&gt; It's a hypothesis, of course, but the long shadow of history, I believe in that. That people have a narrative of history, and they have a certain attitude, again, norms, who are different from regulation. The fact that you respect some regulation or you don't respect them, and if nobody respect them, it's unenforceable. If you bring a cop from Singapore, and you bring him in Cairo, the guy will become nuts within 24 hours because he will not be able to enforce the law, because everybody break the law all the time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000333&quot; id=&quot;000333&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:03:33):&lt;/a&gt; What if you replace the entire Egyptian police force with Singaporean police force? What do you think would happen then?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000341&quot; id=&quot;000341&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:03:41):&lt;/a&gt; I think you will have to do the opposite. You have to replace the entire driving force of Egypt with Singaporeans, of course you won't have enough Singaporeans, because it's the drivers, really, that make the norms. If you have a policeman who try to enforce a law but he has 100 offenders in 10 minutes, he will not be able to do his job. By the time he writes a ticket, there will be 20 people who have passed the red light without stopping.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000410&quot; id=&quot;000410&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:04:10):&lt;/a&gt; You were talking about Singapore was so regulated, and people will obey the law. And one time you were saying if you import a number of foreigners in Singapore and they don't cross when the light is for pedestrians, they cross at any time, it happens in many cities-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000433&quot; id=&quot;000433&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:04:33):&lt;/a&gt; Like you do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000434&quot; id=&quot;000434&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:04:34):&lt;/a&gt; Like I'm doing many times, especially in Switzerland where people are so obeying of the law, and there is no traffic and no one dare to cross the road if the light doesn't come green for the pedestrians. But if you import many people like me in Singapore, the police will be overwhelmed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000458&quot; id=&quot;000458&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:04:58):&lt;/a&gt; Overwhelmed, yes, yes. Yes, you see that. But that reinforces, again, the point. Look at the countries which are very respectful of law. You could have Switzerland, for instance. You'll have the Scandinavian countries which has never been occupied by other countries. You will have New Zealand, Australia, also. They are very respectful. They're a country which have a tradition to be self-governing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/3650dbbc-d4df-41bb-af21-eb2c88c00d0a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;288&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000527&quot; id=&quot;000527&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:05:27):&lt;/a&gt; So in the US, actually, the US contradicts my theory a bit, because New York is not really respectful. But say, other cities are more. But let's say San Francisco, I think, is more respectful of traffic than ... So I don't know. Maybe in the case of New York it's the very large number of immigrants. I understand, if I remember well, something like 45% of people who live in New York are not born in the US. So most probably, they were born in countries which were they were not self-governing in a traditional way. I don't know, I'm trying to justify my theory.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000604&quot; id=&quot;000604&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:06:04):&lt;/a&gt; It sounds like if you ... According to that theory, then it would predict that the way you learned how to drive, depending on where you were, would then predict how you behaved later. If you learn how to drive in, I don't know, India, which I think has a very, very ... Crazy drivers, then you come to the US, do you think that you would be more likely to have crazy driving norms? Like disrespecting the rules a little bit more? Or do you think we can assimilate quickly into whatever the norms are of the area that you're in?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000633&quot; id=&quot;000633&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:06:33):&lt;/a&gt; I think you assimilate if you're alone. If you learn to drive, if you have your license in Egypt or in India, but for some reason you move to Singapore or Switzerland, I am sure within a week you'll follow the rules because you'll have accumulated so many tickets, because you are the only one to do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000653&quot; id=&quot;000653&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:06:53):&lt;/a&gt; And so I think it's not so much how you learn, it's more the practice. Let's say you adapt to the norms of your peers, and if your peers are breaking the law in a way ... That's what an Egyptian taxi driver told me one day, when I asked him, &quot;Why do you go through the red light without stopping?&quot; And he says, &quot;Well, because everybody does it.&quot; So you see, it's game theory in a way, that you expect other people to behave in a certain way and you adjust your behavior to the way other people behave.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000729&quot; id=&quot;000729&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:07:29):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, I was told a story by one of my friends who was from Argentina, and he spent some time in Bolivia. And he said that in Bolivia, there are a lot of intersections where people don't stop at all. They completely ignore the light, keep going, and they'll just go, go, go. And then, as soon as there's a gap, then the other side will start going and go, go, go. And so everyone gets really stuck because if there's enough traffic, then there's just this constant stream and you can never break through.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000758&quot; id=&quot;000758&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:07:58):&lt;/a&gt; And in that case, I think, I follow the rules pretty carefully when I'm driving in the United States. But if I was in Bolivia and I have to get where I'm going, I think I would probably do the same thing, because otherwise you're just going to be stuck there because you're never going to find that gap at the same time as the green light.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/34259c70-fcc5-4883-a95d-a6a4a7fc5be0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;The streets of Bolivia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000815&quot; id=&quot;000815&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:08:15):&lt;/a&gt; Yes, right. Yeah, so that's game theory. You adjust to what you expect other people to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000821&quot; id=&quot;000821&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:08:21):&lt;/a&gt; Let's say, I think Sweden, for instance, or Singapore, both have pretty strict driving norms, and people are very cautious on the street. What would you do? Let's say you wanted to make their norms more dangerous and you wanted people to be more reckless on the road. How would you cause that cultural change?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000838&quot; id=&quot;000838&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:08:38):&lt;/a&gt; I would import five million drivers from Cairo. But you have to do it at the same time. If you import them 10 or 100 at a time, it won't work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000847&quot; id=&quot;000847&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:08:47):&lt;/a&gt; I see. So if they come in a steady trickle, then they'll get integrated into the local norms?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000853&quot; id=&quot;000853&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:08:53):&lt;/a&gt; Don't forget that also, in Singapore, like also I would say New Zealand or Switzerland, certainly, it's not only the cops who intervene. It's also the people who look at you. In Switzerland, they will say, &quot;Why'd you cross? It's not your turn to cross,&quot; because they expect people to follow the rules. And for them, this is a rule.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000914&quot; id=&quot;000914&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:09:14):&lt;/a&gt; And so I think it's enforced also by the population, not necessarily only by the cops. You see everybody standing and looking at you and you feel a little bad, self conscious, so you don't do it any more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000927&quot; id=&quot;000927&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:09:27):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be surprised if the social norms were actually stronger than the policing norms in a lot of places, where you don't do it because you don't want your friends to judge you, more than that you're worried about the police.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000941&quot; id=&quot;000941&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:09:41):&lt;/a&gt; That's right, yeah. Yeah. In a certain way, that's why in the United States, you mow your lawn, and you feel obliged to mow your lawn if the grass is too high. You feel a little self conscious, also, compared to the neighbor. You are very comfortable having tall grass in your yard, but you feel that other people might object ... And you try not to antagonize your neighbors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001005&quot; id=&quot;001005&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:10:05):&lt;/a&gt; Transportation is a really big part of a culture. I think it's something that's kind of underrated, when people talk about the culture of France or the culture of Japan. They usually talk about the food or the wine, or the way people talk and the language, but I think the way people move around really affects the culture and vibe of the city as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001025&quot; id=&quot;001025&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:10:25):&lt;/a&gt; The kinds of interactions that you have with other people are very different if you're in a car versus on a bike, versus on the subway, versus walking around. And you two have lived in a lot of different cities, and worked in even more cities. I'm curious, how does the mix of transit modes impact the culture and vibe a city that you've been in?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001043&quot; id=&quot;001043&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:10:43):&lt;/a&gt; When we arrived in Yemen, I will say that in Sanaa, there were probably 300 or 400 cars, so very, very few cars. Most people would have either motorcycles, and there were not that many either, and then donkeys and camels. But most people in Sanaa would just walk. The city at the time was 80,000 people, and pretty high density, so you could walk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/d8a242ae-f168-40e7-ac94-88c49babb922.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Sana'a, Yemen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001108&quot; id=&quot;001108&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:08):&lt;/a&gt; There is no doubt that if you are one of the few people with cars, you tend to be a little more ruthless because people fear you. They know that they are going to be hurt more than you, and it give a sense of hierarchy, which is very unhealthy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001129&quot; id=&quot;001129&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:29):&lt;/a&gt; I think also then after that, when people get richer and there are more people having cars, let's say 20% or 30%, which is the case now probably in urban India at least. Then you still have the arrogance of the people with cars, saying that, &quot;I have acquired this car. This is new. This give me a certain power over other people,&quot; and the feeling that the roads are designed for cars, the cars have priorities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001159&quot; id=&quot;001159&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:59):&lt;/a&gt; So it give a sense of hierarchy which is very unhealthy. I think that the country which are more middle class and have an older tradition of being rich, that mean the car is not a new thing, probably drive more carefully. When I was in Nepal the first time in 1963, there were no roads between the two main cities, Kathmandu and Pokhara, and people walked the distance. It's about 200 kilometers, if I remember well, between the two cities. And there was a trail, and people were walking. Entire family were walking from one city to another with their luggage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001244&quot; id=&quot;001244&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:12:44):&lt;/a&gt; A lot of porters, also. They hire a lot of porters. There no animals, because in the mountains there were a lot of staircase which were carved in the rock in the mountain. So it was a country where just everybody walk. And rich people would have porters, and poor people just carry their own load. It give a completely, also, different attitude. I found it very nice, but I was young and very healthy, and liked to hike, so that was fine. Maybe at my age now I would not find it so nice to walk with a load 200 kilometers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001319&quot; id=&quot;001319&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:13:19):&lt;/a&gt; Maybe you just have to get a porter, then.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001321&quot; id=&quot;001321&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:13:21):&lt;/a&gt; Yes, maybe. I could afford a porter, probably.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001323&quot; id=&quot;001323&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:13:23):&lt;/a&gt; Marie-Agnes, how about you? What cities come to mind as having interesting transportation networks, and how did that affect the culture there?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001330&quot; id=&quot;001330&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:13:30):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, we were living in Thailand. You'd be stuck in traffic for hours without almost moving, and then you realize that you were not alone. Public transport was not too well organized. Most of them were kind of motorbike with three wheels, with some seat on the back. Those one were more flexible, and the most motorbike being not as large as a car, so they would be passing in front of you continuously and squeezing in between lines of car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/a68325aa-2b9f-4934-bfbe-30568873a7ea.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Buses, minibuses and taxis share the streets with private vehicles at Ratchadamri Road, Bangkok.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001408&quot; id=&quot;001408&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:14:08):&lt;/a&gt; And after then, some time, the city decided to have some bus transportation be organized. And things get a little bit better, but still, the richer people didn't take the public transport. And we were working for a company run by the government, National Housing Authority. And they have the good idea to have an air conditioning bus, very comfortable, so we abandoned our car and took the air conditioning bus. We did not mind riding in the bus and be stuck in the traffic because it was very nice to be in a cool atmosphere and you could read. At that time, we didn't have internet, but I believe now they may have WiFi on the bus and you can start shooting some emails there and there, or reading your email in the bus.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/14ce4fdd-11f7-4e71-ae1b-c639bc3055b4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; caret-color: rgb(128, 128, 128); color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Getting around Bangkok by bus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001510&quot; id=&quot;001510&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:15:10):&lt;/a&gt; Public transport, I should say, is a plus for a city, especially when it's comfortable. I don't see, in New York, unfortunately, me taking the metro or a bus, because they are not as comfortable and you cannot rely too much on the metro. You can, but many time we were ... At one point, living in New York for three months in Manhattan, and we were commuting from the place in Battery Park to NYU, New York University.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001544&quot; id=&quot;001544&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:15:44):&lt;/a&gt; And many time, we have to calculate the time traveling, saying instead to take 20 minutes, we'll take close to 45 minutes. Double the time, because subway were not on time. The subway would stop in between station. You were in the dark. So it's the comfort of public transportation is really a necessity for many people, especially for old people like we are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001614&quot; id=&quot;001614&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:16:14):&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah, and if you have an option that you can afford, that's more comfortable, then you might as well take that. But then it ends up resulting in more of a separation of different types of people, which is probably unfortunate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001625&quot; id=&quot;001625&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:16:25):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. I usually try to take public transport in all the cities I work in, just as an experience and to see. I like to go to the end of the line to see what happens there. Say in some cities like, again, for instance in Seoul or in Beijing or Shanghai, taking the subway is a pleasure. It's kind of comfortable. I remember in Mumbai taking the suburban train, and I could not get out at the stop I was trying to get out because it was so crowded.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001658&quot; id=&quot;001658&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:16:58):&lt;/a&gt; So after that my Indian friend told me, &quot;You have to know, if you take the train, three or four stations before your station, you have already to move closer to the door. If not, you will never be able to exit, and you'll have to take, after, the train in the other direction in order to get to your station.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/6d25a9cb-a4a9-46b5-b822-3c32b3c6b67c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;A train in New Delhi.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-railway-stations-unsafe-says-grp-s-post-pulwama-audit/story-plIEEkAQXe3J0dubNSYG5I.html&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001717&quot; id=&quot;001717&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:17:17):&lt;/a&gt; So you see that you need an experience like that to ... I think it's useful to always ... I mean, if you are interested in cities, to take public transport sometimes. Not always, but sometime, in order to have experience and most people experience, it give you a very good idea of what the city's like.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001737&quot; id=&quot;001737&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:17:37):&lt;/a&gt; I remember seeing some Tweets about people being quite frustrated, I believe it was with the Board of the MTA in New York, I think. And a bunch of the board members drove to work every day instead of actually using the subway or any of the public transport, which I'm pretty sympathetic to that frustration, because how are you really going to know what the priorities are if you're not using the system?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001801&quot; id=&quot;001801&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:18:01):&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely, yes. Absolutely, yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001804&quot; id=&quot;001804&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:18:04):&lt;/a&gt; So, Marie-Agnes, yesterday you shared with me an article about the 15 minute city idea that the Mayor of Paris is pushing forward. Can you describe that idea? And I'm super curious to hear both of your reactions to that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001817&quot; id=&quot;001817&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:18:17):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, the Mayor of Paris who get reelected recently, the big program now is to make Paris walkable and have maximum 15 minute from your place you leave, to the place you work, the place you shop, either walking or bicycling. And as you know, cities are not only good like a Club Med, where you do your 15 minutes exercise every day in the morning and 15 minute coming back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001851&quot; id=&quot;001851&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:18:51):&lt;/a&gt; A city, ... And Alain may explain better, it's part of his book, the city is job market. It works if you can go from one part of the city to another within less than an hour. And for Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris, if she wants to implement this kind of program, she will have to make a number of street cyclable or pedestrian, and enlarge the sidewalk or do ... And she started already, do convert some of the main interior of Paris, especially along the Seine River, converted to only pedestrian and bicycle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001938&quot; id=&quot;001938&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:19:38):&lt;/a&gt; And before it was the two side of the Seine was highways, and now of course the Parisian who were living in the center of Paris loved this idea. But that penalized all of the other people who need the car to provide services to the city. So Alain can jump on it and explain more, but a topic of things, Paris is not Rotterdam. It's not Amsterdam, it is much larger, and the cities need good transportation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/18e7379e-6250-49ef-8241-71701db44124.jpg&quot; width=&quot;282&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/99a0a6f5-85e1-4404-8ad8-d25336e53099.jpg&quot; width=&quot;156&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/ba99eac1-3917-42d4-8873-6ae97fa858e1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;217&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The core of Paris is being transformed into a &quot;15-minute city&quot;, the idea that every Paris resident should be able to meet their essential needs within a short walk or bike ride. But what does that mean for the people and uses who can't afford price of living in that core and live in Paris' banlieues?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002016&quot; id=&quot;002016&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:20:16):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, sometimes it's ... The model is usually Amsterdam, or Copenhagen. Amsterdam is 700,000 people, and Copenhagen, depending the way you count, about a million, million and a half. And it's completely flat. The municipality of Paris is two and a half million people, but it's surrounded by suburbs and it's a city of 10 million people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002039&quot; id=&quot;002039&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:20:39):&lt;/a&gt; So she's the mayor of the two and a half million people who are in the center of the city, very well served by heavily subsidized public transit. The subway of Paris is really pretty good. The station are renewed and redecorated periodically, and so you could have, if you have a job in Paris, and you live in Paris, you probably ... Maybe 15 minutes would be difficult, but say 20 minutes, 25 minutes would be rather common.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002111&quot; id=&quot;002111&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:21:11):&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately, Paris now, the Paris municipality, that means the constituency of the mayor, is entirely gentrified. She's not saying every Parisian should have 15 minutes trip, she's saying only the people who are in the gentrified area, with a transport system paid at 90% by the French tax payer, should be able to have 15 minutes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002139&quot; id=&quot;002139&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:21:39):&lt;/a&gt; And of course, even that, it's a luxury. She had this idea that jobs will be created a bit everywhere. Jobs tend to concentrate in some area, and less in others. So when it comes to things like the grocery store or schools, or things like that, yes. And in Paris, they are already well distributed, because they're zoning yo prevent shops to establish whenever they like ... There is no zoning which differentiate residential from commercial in Paris, even for an office building. You can convert a house into an office building, or an office building into a house, or a grocery store, without practically any permit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002221&quot; id=&quot;002221&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:22:21):&lt;/a&gt; So that's already achieved. What the mayor doesn't seem to understand is that people go to Paris to work, and more and more jobs are in fact outside the municipality of Paris boundary. I think I show that in my book, because that's part of this gentrification. Many companies find that real estate is so expensive in Paris, again, because of the amenities which are there, which are so attractive for people who are rich enough to afford it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002252&quot; id=&quot;002252&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:22:52):&lt;/a&gt; So many job have moved  outside Paris municipality to the suburbs, where there, of course, they are out of reach from the superb transport within the municipality of Paris. So it's a bit elitist, and strangely enough, she's a socialist but she's a socialist elected by elitist people. By the people who have gentrified the city. So it's a very interesting aspect of politics, I think.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002313&quot; id=&quot;002313&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:23:13):&lt;/a&gt; Aesthetically, I think it seems sort of for the people, by the people, sort of thing? Just, it sounds nice and it sounds like it's a good thing, it's going to make little villages inside of Paris, so I kind of see how those two things go together even though actually, the results of such a system would be quite anti-socialist.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002340&quot; id=&quot;002340&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:23:40):&lt;/a&gt; It's very inequitable, because it's the people who can afford a house of a million dollars or more who'll have free transport. And the people who live in the suburbs, the people who are baking the bread and contributing to the economy of the city, eight million people, will be outside this system and will have to drive because some who work in Paris could take public transport. But most of the other from suburb to suburb have to drive, and they will not benefit from this system. On the contrary, they will be penalized.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002424&quot; id=&quot;002424&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:24:24):&lt;/a&gt; And then there are ... In a city like Paris, you have also a lot of people who absolutely need a car to go around. For instance, if you are an electrician and you are repairing the electricity of buildings and things like that, you cannot take the subway. You have to have a car, because you have your tools, you have your material there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/3a574a6f-3234-41ef-a275-4bd03052719d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;511&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;La Défense is the modern high-rise office-tower district of Paris, at the start of the western outskirts of the city. The core of Paris has limits on building heights (among many other constraints), so the Central Business District (CBD) ended up in La Défense where there are fewer land use constraints. This is atypical; in most cities, CBDs tend to develop at the center of the city, not on the outskirts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002445&quot; id=&quot;002445&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:24:45):&lt;/a&gt; If you are a plumber, if you deliver ... You have all these restaurants in Paris. People have to deliver wine and beer and food to restaurants, so they have to drive, and they are penalized. That mean that instead of, let's say, if you are delivering beer to restaurants in Paris, instead of doing 10 delivery in the day, you are going to do three because there are so few roads that you can use.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002515&quot; id=&quot;002515&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:25:15):&lt;/a&gt; And that means that either your salary will be much less or that whatever you deliver will be much more expensive. Probably a bit of the two. So it's not really well thought of, it's kind of a utopian ... And very elitist. It's very elitist, because again, the jobs which remain in Paris, except for the service job, again, in restaurants are corporate jobs. But many of the corporate jobs are the highest paying job. You have corporate lawyers or the headquarter of corporation in Paris, but most of the employees will be in the suburb because real estate is so expensive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002556&quot; id=&quot;002556&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:25:56):&lt;/a&gt; So again, it's extremely inequitable. But of course, the name Paris means the municipality. That means there's two and a half million people who are living in the center of Paris, so it's a ... But the gentrification in the last 50 years have been incredible. I mean, if I compare to the time when we were students, there were really working class neighborhood inside Paris municipality. And you don't see them anymore.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002626&quot; id=&quot;002626&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:26:26):&lt;/a&gt; And also, many of, let's say, the grocery store, the store where just ... A common store have been replaced by high end stores like haute couture or a thing like that. So I'm not against it. I think it's a normal phenomenon. But to pretend that this is for the people is not quite true. There is an enormous gentrification.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002656&quot; id=&quot;002656&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:26:56):&lt;/a&gt; Do you think that Anne Hidalgo, that the mayor, understands this dynamic and she's sort of cynically pushing it forward as a nice political move because the people in her district who voted her in support it? Or do you think she actually just doesn't really understand the dynamics and she believes that this will have a positive impact and an equitable one, but in fact, that's not the case?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002718&quot; id=&quot;002718&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:27:18):&lt;/a&gt; I think she's part of what the French call the gauche caviar, the caviar left. It's people who are intellectuals, you know, they are part of the elite. They make a good living. They feel a little bad about it because the French that are always raised on the ideal of the French Revolution, of Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité. And they compensate, let's say they are in a privileged situation by pretending that they are very ... They want to share, they want to be social ... And I think it's, she probably knows inside herself that it's not quite right... But her constituency is this gauche caviar, also. It's caviar left.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002801&quot; id=&quot;002801&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:28:01):&lt;/a&gt; And so in a way, it's a good way of getting reelected too. The people who have a one or two million dollars house in Paris don't care so much about the electrician who is going to fix their air conditioner or anything like that. I mean, the guy will always come anyways, so that's not one of their problem. And they are very unlikely to go and work in the suburbs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002827&quot; id=&quot;002827&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:28:27):&lt;/a&gt; But you could see the anger of people during the Gilets Jaunes, the demonstration. I don't know if you have followed that in Paris, before the COVID. There were these demonstration every weekend. People were coming from the suburbs or from the province to Paris, and they were trashing monuments, but also high end restaurants, high end shops. And that was really this anger. I mean, I don't think this was legitimate. Vandalism is never justified. But there was this anger against this enormous gentrification that benefited from enormous subsidies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002910&quot; id=&quot;002910&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:29:10):&lt;/a&gt; I will add that also, she was elected because there is a big movement, as in many other countries, the Green have been electing Hidalgo because she promised also to have more green space in a city in Paris, and she's converting parking into parks. Not bad, but the things are, the people, the Parisian, love the idea to have a park next door. That makes apartment more valuable because you have a park next door. So the movement of Green are also pushing this idea of having transport, having less car in the city, and go by foot and go by bicycle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003002&quot; id=&quot;003002&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:30:02):&lt;/a&gt; How will that impact the people who live in the suburbs?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003005&quot; id=&quot;003005&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:30:05):&lt;/a&gt; It will be worse than them, I mean when ... The contrast between the life in Paris and the life in the suburb will be much, much larger. Suddenly over there, it's so ... Because Paris is full of monument which are extremely well maintained. There is a large central government budget to maintain those monuments. For, let's say, the bridges on the Seine, some of them which were built in the 19th century, have golden decoration on it. And this gold is reapplied.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/9c13451e-3e60-45d0-98ad-c38d49fbacf3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2072&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003038&quot; id=&quot;003038&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:30:38):&lt;/a&gt; I mean, I'm not sure it's real gold, but say, the maintenance is extremely expensive, and it's extremely well done. But it's done with the tax payer money, so you have this little enclave in the middle of this big city of Paris, of 10 million people, for two and a half million people, where the money of the state is concentrated as a prestige thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003059&quot; id=&quot;003059&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:30:59):&lt;/a&gt; And again, I am not saying it's bad, necessarily. But it's certainly very inequitable. So it's going to create a lot of resentment from the people living in the suburbs. We just know that about it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003112&quot; id=&quot;003112&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:31:12):&lt;/a&gt; There's also that rule ... I'm going to definitely mispronounce this, but the &quot;fuseaux&quot;. I don't know, my Spanish accent is now coming out. But the perspective protection rule that you wrote about in your book. How does that affect these dynamics, too, and the height limits as well?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003128&quot; id=&quot;003128&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:31:28):&lt;/a&gt; That's why many of the jobs have left Paris. The amount of floor space in Paris, again, when I say Paris I mean the municipality, two and a half million people, it's limit ... And by the way, it's a very fixed limit, because it has a highway around it, the Peripherique, which were where the fortification of Paris were before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003149&quot; id=&quot;003149&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:31:49):&lt;/a&gt; So you know exactly when you enter Paris and when you leave Paris for the suburb, because there is a physical barrier. These &quot;fuseaux de protection&quot;, which protect the view from one area of Paris to some monument, the Arc de Triomphe or the Louvre or a thing like that, make Paris like a theater in a way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003210&quot; id=&quot;003210&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:32:10):&lt;/a&gt; It's very beautiful. It's a very ... But, of course, it prevents any addition of floor space within Paris. So as the economy develop, and business cannot expand within Paris because you have this absolute limit to the floor space which is there. Corporations tend to keep their headquarter in Paris for the prestige,but for only a few offices and conference room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003237&quot; id=&quot;003237&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:32:37):&lt;/a&gt; But all the workers are moved to the periphery, where then there is not such limit. And land, of course, real estate is much cheaper. So you have this dichotomy, that having the headquarter ... And now, by the way, it's all the more possible because of the Internet. Before, the employees and the bosses and the management had to be in the same building because the exchange of communication in the firm was through memos, which were typed. So the paperwork has to move back and forth within the administration, and you had to be together.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003314&quot; id=&quot;003314&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:33:14):&lt;/a&gt; Now with the Internet, you could have the ruling elite of a company in a building in the center of Paris where 90% of the worker are in some lousy suburbs, at 20 kilometers from there. And it doesn't affect the management at all, because they communicate by internet and so all the information is transmitted even faster than it was when they were all in the same building. So this is convergence of things, it's quite interesting, and the effect it has on social segregation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003346&quot; id=&quot;003346&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:33:46):&lt;/a&gt; That's fascinating, yeah. I mean, it sounds like the tradeoff that the municipality has made is to preserve central Paris as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with the gold plated bridges, and the monuments with the great view throughout the whole city. But then there's this cost of pushing jobs and people outside of the city core.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003404&quot; id=&quot;003404&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:34:04):&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah, yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003406&quot; id=&quot;003406&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:34:06):&lt;/a&gt; That's a fundamentally political choice. How did they arrive at that decision?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003409&quot; id=&quot;003409&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:34:09):&lt;/a&gt; The French are very proud of Paris, because it's only large city in France. Paris is 10 million. The next cities, Marseille and Lyon, both of them are one million. So it's a huge drop, and that's because of the centralization of the French system, centralization which came at a time of themonarchy, but was even reinforced at the Revolution.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003434&quot; id=&quot;003434&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:34:34):&lt;/a&gt; And the French Revolution took place in Paris. It was really a Parisian thing, and it was imposed on the province to the point that they were provincial states, which would be the equivalent of states in the United States. For instance, Provence or Gascony, where entities traditionally which were rather large. And the Revolution destroyed all of that, and divided the country into 90 departments.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003504&quot; id=&quot;003504&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:35:04):&lt;/a&gt; So imagine if the United States had Washington DC, and then everything else would be a county. You will have the federal government and the county government, without states. You will have an enormous centralization of power, by necessity, and this is exactly what happened in France. So this centralization of power, then, resulted in even a democratic government tend to spend more money in the place where they live. The deputies, they live in Paris. They may represent Marseille, but they basically live in Paris, so they will spend more money on Paris maintenance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003543&quot; id=&quot;003543&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:35:43):&lt;/a&gt; And, of course, Paris is the symbol of France much more than Marseille or Bordeaux, or something, where the United States is so much more decentralized, or even a country like Germany, for instance. It's much more decentralized by definition. Berlin is one thing, but you have Hamburg, you have Stuttgart, you have Frankfurt. You have Munich. Each city is a bit equivalent, in a way, with a very different personality. That's not the case in France, where Paris completely dominates. Everything is done in Paris.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003617&quot; id=&quot;003617&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:36:17):&lt;/a&gt; So in a way, the privilege of Paris reflect a very deep cultural tradition in France against starting from the 17th century, Louis XIV, and reinforced, interestingly enough, by the Revolution.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003632&quot; id=&quot;003632&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:36:32):&lt;/a&gt; One country that's very similar to France in this regard is Japan. Tokyo is one of the biggest, by far the biggest city in Japan, and it's really very quite centralized there. Do they have similar histories that caused that centralization, or did they centralize for different reasons?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003649&quot; id=&quot;003649&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:36:49):&lt;/a&gt; I suppose that it's a bit similar, although it's a different story. The shogun, traditionally, were a very centralized power. And then they moved. And then when they were replaced again by the emperor, the idea that there is an emperor was, I think, reinforced the thing. And yes, it's possible that it's a bit equivalent, although a city like Osaka is still very large. Osaka is what, 25 million, I think? Yeah, something like that, 30 million people. I mean, it's not insignificant.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003716&quot; id=&quot;003716&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:16):&lt;/a&gt; Tokyo itself is 40 million, if I remember well. But Tokyo Yokohama is close to 40 million, so it's a big city. But there is more a hierarchy of city, I think, in Japan. But it's possible, too, that the power of the central government in Japan is very high. Maybe similar to what it is in France, kind of a centralized power.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003744&quot; id=&quot;003744&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:44):&lt;/a&gt; For instance, the Japanese have an industrial policy for distributing industry and subsidizing industry within the country, which is very similar to France, too. France has exactly the same system. So it's possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003758&quot; id=&quot;003758&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:58):&lt;/a&gt; I think that even a country like Mexico, if Mexico City is 25 million people and the next city is much smaller, it's again because of centralization of power. Although Mexico is a federal republic, but still, the political power is really in Mexico City. And when sometime Mexican planners are saying, &quot;Well, we should encourage the growth of smaller cities, Mexico is unmanageable,&quot; things like that, but this will never work unless the change the centralization of power that's inherent, again, probably the republic. Maybe it come to the history of the republic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We didn't cover Maglev in this episode, but it's such a cool technology that I couldn't help but squeeze these diagrams into the post. 🙂&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003839&quot; id=&quot;003839&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:38:39):&lt;/a&gt; I wonder how the Shinkansen in Japan impacted centralization of the country. For people listening, the Shinkansen is the high speed train system, and it's been around for about 50 years in Japan. And it links a bunch of different distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, and the whole purpose of it was to aid economic growth and development around the country.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003901&quot; id=&quot;003901&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:39:01):&lt;/a&gt; But my instinct, now ... I'm curious if you two agree with this. My instinct is that by connecting all of these regions to Tokyo, it just accelerated the consolidation into the center of the country, and into Tokyo, because now everyone can be linked up to headquarters of their company, and there's less regional development. And I say that descriptively, not normatively. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. But does that make sense to you?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003926&quot; id=&quot;003926&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:39:26):&lt;/a&gt; I think that in itself, the high speed train could promote decentralization. It could. But if you combine the high speed train with the demographic problem that Japan has since about 30 years now, aging population, then I think that the growth of Tokyo ... Tokyo now is practically the only city which is growing in Japan, and it's growing not ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003955&quot; id=&quot;003955&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:39:55):&lt;/a&gt; The population of Japan is shrinking slightly, so it's growing because young people are coming from smaller city. If they look for a job, they want to look for a job in Tokyo, not in a city where you have a majority of old people. And Tokyo also is much more attractive for young people because of its amenities, restaurant, thing like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004019&quot; id=&quot;004019&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:40:19):&lt;/a&gt; As soon as a city is dominated by old people, the quality of the amenities disappears. So I think that the centralization now, the growth of Tokyo, is explained more by the demographic. And it's possible that the fast train allow young people to go to Tokyo several time to test the water, find a job, and then go back home. And then eventually, settle in Tokyo. That's possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004053&quot; id=&quot;004053&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:40:53):&lt;/a&gt; But I think that it could go either way. For instance, when they established the TGV, which is a bit equivalent of the Shinkansen, in France, a rapid train between Paris and the province, I know that in my own town of Marseille, as soon as the TVG reach ... So we were at five hours from Paris instead of 12 hours, it increased the real estate crisis in Marseille, increasing housing prices, and the same with Nantes and Bordeaux, the other big cities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004127&quot; id=&quot;004127&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:41:27):&lt;/a&gt; So I think that the fast train could go either way. And then France could be either way. I'm not so sure that will be a big influence in reinforcing, let's say, the primacy of the capital.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004143&quot; id=&quot;004143&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:41:43):&lt;/a&gt; In Japan, when we were there, we went to a small town on the west coast of Japan, Toyama. The mayor was trying to ... There was a fast train, from Tokyo to Toyama, it took two and a half hours. And the mayor was very concerned, because all the young people were leaving Toyama and moving to live close to Tokyo, and only the old people would stay there. And the city of Toyama was doing well before the fast train, and suddenly, you have all the suburb of Toyama get deserted by the young people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004227&quot; id=&quot;004227&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:42:27):&lt;/a&gt; And so the mayor wanted to suppress the infrastructure for the outskirt of Toyama, because it was too costing to provide services to the few houses who were still occupied. And he proposed to the old people to move to the center of Toyama in converted school, all the stadium and everything, for lodging for the old people. And giving to the old people the chance to be living in an apartment building with all the amenities, doctors, nurse, hospital close by. All the service that old people need to attract those old people back to the center, and eliminate all the infrastructure that was provided before for the larger area were doing well before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004326&quot; id=&quot;004326&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:43:26):&lt;/a&gt; So this is, again, the fast train was a big problem for the Toyama city, and I don't know if you'll have the chance to get back the young people. The mayor was giving incentive to Microsoft people to have their office in Toyama, thinking that the young people will not have to commute anymore to Tokyo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004350&quot; id=&quot;004350&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:43:50):&lt;/a&gt; But things didn't work ever, so there is a lot of problem with the young people want to have access to more job and change job eventually, and if you are in a small town now, it's not so easy. Maybe with the Internet, how we've ... The young people will be going back to the country. But who knows what's next?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004417&quot; id=&quot;004417&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:44:17):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, the incentives there are so interesting. A friend of mine lives in Japan and he told me about these residential taxes that Japanese cities impose on you, so I'm going to get the details wrong, but basically you're supposed to pay 10% of your tax to the town that you live in directly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004434&quot; id=&quot;004434&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:44:34):&lt;/a&gt; For many people that is Tokyo, but there was this rule that was passed a little while back called the Hometown Tax, and basically the rule said something like, &quot;If you send 3% of the 10% back to your hometown, then you get a rebate on where you currently live.&quot; So say you grew up in Kyoto, but now you live in Tokyo. Instead of paying 10% to Tokyo, you could send 3% back to Kyoto and only pay 7% to Tokyo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004504&quot; id=&quot;004504&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:45:04):&lt;/a&gt; And some of the smaller towns started realizing that they didn't actually define what hometown meant. There was no specific definition of saying you had to be born there. It was just sort of this fuzzy term, and so they started sending gifts to people who gave the 3% back to them. And some of those gifts would end up being extraordinarily expensive, for instance, if you gave 3% back, they might spend up to 2% to buy you plane tickets to come visit your hometown, and basically you get a free vacation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004537&quot; id=&quot;004537&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:45:37):&lt;/a&gt; And there's this whole system now of gifts that towns will give you, and people will often choose particularly idyllic towns that they have basically no connection to. But they just want a free vacation, to go visit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004550&quot; id=&quot;004550&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:45:50):&lt;/a&gt; You know, when the government want to tinker with thing like that, usually it doesn't work very well. It create all sort of distortion in a funny way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004600&quot; id=&quot;004600&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:46:00):&lt;/a&gt; What have been times where governments have tinkered like that, but it actually worked out okay?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004606&quot; id=&quot;004606&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:46:06):&lt;/a&gt; That's a difficult question. I'm sure it does work at times, but I cannot think of anything right now. Well, in France we have a Minister of Culture, which a big budget. It's a very prestigious position, so André Malraux, the writer, was a minister. And he established a tax, in a way, a maintenance tax on buildings. At the time, the buildings of Paris were completely black because of the pollution from cars, and so all these buildings , which are built in a very beautiful kind of yellowish stone, were in fact completely black.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004648&quot; id=&quot;004648&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:46:48):&lt;/a&gt; And so Malraux established an obligation for every owner of building to clean their façade every 10 years, I think, which is quite expensive if you have a stone façade. It has to be done in a certain way. You cannot use any chemical product because it will damage the stone. But the government took also the obligation to clean, also, all the monuments, including Notre-Dame and all these monuments that are in France.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004722&quot; id=&quot;004722&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:47:22):&lt;/a&gt; So there is no doubt that it created a much more attractive Paris. There was a huge difference after the law  Malraux, but it made also housing much more expensive, because you had this large expenditure of maintenance for the building. So you see, again, it's a thing which it's nice in a way, but it backfire on the people. Paris is more attractive physically, but it eliminate the poorer people from Paris. And it was a government decision, which I do not, by the way, necessarily criticize. I think that ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004804&quot; id=&quot;004804&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:48:04):&lt;/a&gt; But we should be aware when we do something like that, that we are making a tradeoff. And maybe for the image of France and Paris, or maybe for the image that the French have their own country, it's a good thing to have a very beautiful Paris with façades which are clean and nice. But it has a consequence socially, and maybe we have to compensate the people who are losing by doing something in their province or something like that. I mean, if we are aware of the consequence. The problem is beautifying an area without thinking of the impact it will have on the people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004848&quot; id=&quot;004848&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:48:48):&lt;/a&gt; The Malraux law was not only for Paris, also the cities like Marseille. They have an obligation every 10 years to clean the façade. And it's a budget that now is part of the maintenance, and I think it has, in the cities in France, most of them, are so beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004914&quot; id=&quot;004914&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:49:14):&lt;/a&gt; And they make a lot of effort, having flowers in the main street and on the entrance. And if you visit any place in France, it's really so attractive and so much diversity from one place in France to the other, if you go to Brittany, or if you go to Provence. It has so much character. It has so much beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004942&quot; id=&quot;004942&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:49:42):&lt;/a&gt; And I think the French appreciate and like it very much, and of course, it's expensive too ... It's more expensive, but I think we love, the people love nice things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004956&quot; id=&quot;004956&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:49:56):&lt;/a&gt; It is unfortunate, though, that the building owners have to pay for it. Because it sounds like it's really an externality from the drivers, so if I were the Queen of France, I think I would try to make it like a gas tax or something to fund all of this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005010&quot; id=&quot;005010&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:50:10):&lt;/a&gt; Yes, I completely agree with you on that. But a gas tax will be paid by everybody, and especially now, a gas tax is paid more by people who have old cars than people who have new cars, because there's a huge difference in-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005027&quot; id=&quot;005027&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:50:27):&lt;/a&gt; Technology for cars.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005029&quot; id=&quot;005029&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:50:29):&lt;/a&gt; ... efficiency. And so it would be an extremely unpopular tax, where here, the appearance is that, &quot;Oh, it's owner of building who are paying.&quot; So therefore, a lot of people rent in Paris, so they feel they are not affected. And in fact, they were affected. But I agree, yes, that would be the best way to do it. Unfortunately, well, another thing which backfired, you're asking something which backfired ... No, you were asking for a positive thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005101&quot; id=&quot;005101&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:51:01):&lt;/a&gt; So, another thing which backfired in France, they discovered, when global warming start being a concern, that a diesel car emit less carbon dioxide than the regular gasoline. So they decided to subsidize diesel, and so they subsidized diesel to the point a liter of diesel used to cost, I think, half of the price of a liter of gasoline because of the tax difference. And some other countries of Europe did the same thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005136&quot; id=&quot;005136&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:51:36):&lt;/a&gt; So most manufacturer in Europe start making diesel cars, and then you realize that the diesel produce much more pollution than the gasoline, and you end up with terrible air quality that was not like that before in Paris and all that. So again, it's a goodwill subsidy to manipulate certain things which backfire. When you introduce a subsidy in something, you have to be very, very careful about all the side effects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005205&quot; id=&quot;005205&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:52:05):&lt;/a&gt; Oh, dear. So it sounds like they just had the science wrong. They thought diesel was better, and it turned out to actually be worse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005212&quot; id=&quot;005212&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:12):&lt;/a&gt; When Volkswagen cheated on the test, for them, they had invested so much in diesel, they didn't want ... They knew that diesel was polluting, in all honesty. And when the European Union put those new law about pollution, not only about carbon dioxide, but also NOx or particulates, they realized that they would have to retool entirely, to move from diesel to something else.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005242&quot; id=&quot;005242&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:42):&lt;/a&gt; There was no such thing as clean diesel. So they decided to cheat on the test, and they developed this very clever software which could identify when the car was passing a test, and when it was on the road, so they could cheat on the test. And then they could sell their cars passing the standards. And it was only discovered in the United States by some academics who wanted to understand better all the pollution vary at different speed on the road, and they realized that the tests were fake.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005318&quot; id=&quot;005318&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:53:18):&lt;/a&gt; Wow, so it sounds like Volkswagen, in a certain way, was painted into a corner where they had been encouraged by the government to do this diesel RMD, and develop cars that way, because it was subsidized, which is really the government sort of blessing that entire direction. And then later on, the government turned around and was like, &quot;Okay, and we're going to add these other tests which actually make all of that investment that you've made moot.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005343&quot; id=&quot;005343&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:53:43):&lt;/a&gt; That's right, yeah. And by the way, first, it was Volkswagen who get caught. But then they discovered that other manufacturer, like Renault for instance, did exactly the same thing. But they were not caught at the same time. But, because again, it was a big ... I mean, I'm not so sure it was survival, but it was certainly to their advantage. I mean, it would have caused a big financial upheaval if they had to suddenly convert all their car from diesel to regular gasoline.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005414&quot; id=&quot;005414&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:54:14):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, and now the French government is subsidizing the electric cars, even the bicycle. If you have an old bicycle now, if you want to go back to your bicycle and you need some little repair before you use your old bicycle, you have a 50 Euro bonus if you go to a repair shop and the repair shop will charge you the price for repairing your bike, but you will have, from the government, the 50 Euros so your price for repairing will be less than it will have been normally. So there is all sort of things like this that the French love to get from the government. The French have a feeling that these things are normal, everything has to be provided by government.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005513&quot; id=&quot;005513&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:55:13):&lt;/a&gt; That's really interesting. What impacts has the subsidy for electric vehicles had on Paris and other French cities?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005521&quot; id=&quot;005521&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:55:21):&lt;/a&gt; For the moment, they are just starting, so we don't know yet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005524&quot; id=&quot;005524&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:55:24):&lt;/a&gt; Less pollution.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005525&quot; id=&quot;005525&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:55:25):&lt;/a&gt; But my problem with it is that as soon as you define a subsidy, you define also sometime a technology, so in a way, you select a technology which is not necessarily the best when you start a new thing. For instance, you know the French were probably the first to develop a quasi-Internet, run by government, what? In the '70s? The Minitel. It was free. It was a government service, and it allows you from a terminal in your branch on the telephone, in your house, for instance, to buy a train ticket or plane ticket or a thing like that. To check the hours when films were playing in a cinema.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/7d1c486f-4763-4b9a-aeba-924644364983.jpg&quot; width=&quot;376&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;The Minitel was a online service accessible through telephone lines, and it was the world's most successful online service prior to the World Wide Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005612&quot; id=&quot;005612&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:56:12):&lt;/a&gt; So it was a bit like the Internet, except you could not send messages to other people. You could send message only to the administration and thing like that. You could probably pay your taxes that way. But it was free. It was entirely subsidized by the government, so the more successful it was, the more expensive it became for the tax payer. So eventually you don't make any more progress. You try to restrict the number of user, because it costs so much. So it's opposite of a free enterprise, when they are successful. Then they can expend their service and be cheaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005647&quot; id=&quot;005647&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:56:47):&lt;/a&gt; Here, if it's free, then it becomes more expensive so you tend to restrict it. So eventually it disappeared, and it was replaced by the Internet. But I think French there get to the Internet later, because they had this Minitel in between which was, in a way, very convenient, but prevented them to shift to the Internet. I remember debates with my mother about it. She was a big fan of the Minitel and she didn't want to hear about computers, because she thought the Minitel was doing very well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005719&quot; id=&quot;005719&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:57:19):&lt;/a&gt; There is definitely a certain arrogance to subsidizing a particular technology, because you're really saying, &quot;We know enough. We're going to pick this winner and ignore all of the others.&quot; And the Minitel, it sounds like, was actually quite useful, but with the diesel, clearly, they picked the wrong one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005737&quot; id=&quot;005737&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:57:37):&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah. Well, you could ... We are talking about transport, so we could talk about the Concorde, too. The Concorde was a government enterprise between the British and the French to subsidize transport, supersonic transport, which was also a beautiful plane. I mean, it was well done. But commercially, completely unviable, because the technology became effective, it manufactured the plane just at the time of the oil shock. So gasoline was costing much more, and the Concorde, to fly between Paris and London and to New York, in terms of gasoline I think it consumed something like five time more than the normal flight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005823&quot; id=&quot;005823&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:58:23):&lt;/a&gt; And the plane was much smaller. If you were a passenger, it was an enormous bill. So they had to subsidize every passenger's ... The price on the Concorde was equivalent of a first class ticket plus 25%. There was no other class. But even this first class ticket was subsidized, so they gave ... By the way, at the time, of course Air France and British Airway could not even fill their plane with passengers at this price, so they gave a discount to the World Bank so that we could use the Concorde. So it was very nice for us, of course, and when I discovered that my champagne on the Concorde was subsidized by the French tax payer, I shifted to British Airways. I thought, &quot;Well, at least let the Brits will pay for my champagne.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wide-img-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/1605d05b-bc04-4cab-8f09-05d38e02a5f9.png&quot; width=&quot;151&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacer&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/a775af70-5797-418b-80aa-a2841c71d820.png&quot; width=&quot;162&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/0aaf499d-2914-4479-9714-c1db27db1411/6321c5ca-9d18-4931-a027-89d030274631.png&quot; width=&quot;127&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005914&quot; id=&quot;005914&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:59:14):&lt;/a&gt; But you know, you have this absurd situation where you have a government subsidizing luxury transport. But justifying, because of the prestige of having a ... And they selected a technology at the wrong time. There is another example like that, by the way. It was the slaughterhouse of Paris. Up to the '50s, '60s, traditionally, the cattle were brought from the province to Paris and there were a number of slaughterhouses in the northeast of Paris, where the cattle were slaughtered. A bit like the big slaughterhouse of Chicago in the old days.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010000&quot; id=&quot;010000&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:00:00):&lt;/a&gt; And then, the meat was distributed in Paris, but also then sent to the province by train, by refrigerated train. So the government decided to have another slaughterhouse, which would consolidate all the smaller slaughterhouses there in one area, and it was supposed to be all automatic. They introduced electronic in it. A lot of people worked on it. It was apparently a superb system, when they just finished it. It took many years and billions of dollars to finish it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010034&quot; id=&quot;010034&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:00:34):&lt;/a&gt; Suddenly the technology have changed, because refrigerated trucks became much cheaper than they were before. And so there were a lot of very small slaughterhouses where the cattle were, in Normandy or wherever the cattle were. And then the meat was sent already slaughtered, cut. Was sent to either Paris or wherever they were going by refrigerated truck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010059&quot; id=&quot;010059&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:00:59):&lt;/a&gt; And there was no need any more to bring millions of cattle every year to Paris to be slaughtered, and it was ... So this enormous building was finished, with all the electronic in it, and the government didn't know what to do with it because nobody wanted to operate it. And so they decide to ... The only way ... The building stood empty for a long time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010125&quot; id=&quot;010125&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:01:25):&lt;/a&gt; And then there were squatter in it, and the squatters were rock bands. You know, rock bands in Paris have the problem that it makes a lot of noise, and Paris is dense. So it's difficult to play rock, to especially rehearse rock music, without the neighbors complaining. So they found that moving into this enormous empty structure, they could rehearse, the rock bands.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010149&quot; id=&quot;010149&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:01:49):&lt;/a&gt; And then it became a center of rock music. Eventually, the state converted it into a music center. So it's a very, very funny story. That's all, again, selecting a technology long in advance by the state, without really looking at alternatives ... Where money is no object, like the Concorde, can lead to some absurd things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010213&quot; id=&quot;010213&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:13):&lt;/a&gt; Now, the outcome, maybe, is not so bad. I don't know if a slaughterhouse transformed into a rock rehearsal room is a good thing, I don't know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010224&quot; id=&quot;010224&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:02:24):&lt;/a&gt; What was the name of the slaughterhouse?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010227&quot; id=&quot;010227&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:27):&lt;/a&gt; It's called La Villette. No, it's opposite side of Rungis, yeah. No, Rungis was a success, actually. The wholesale food market of Rungis was a success. You know, the other operation was to move Les Halles of Paris. Les Halles, which was described by Zola, where you have this central food wholesale market in the middle of Paris next to the Pompidou Center.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010250&quot; id=&quot;010250&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:50):&lt;/a&gt; And they moved it to the southern part of Paris, next to the old airport. And that was very successful, so I have to give credit here for that. That was extremely successful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010302&quot; id=&quot;010302&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:03:02):&lt;/a&gt; It's interesting to think about which sorts of projects are appropriate for the government to take on and which ones are not. I know you've spoken in the past about how important it is for some sort of central system, most likely a government, to lay out the grid and certain types of infrastructure can be built on top.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010321&quot; id=&quot;010321&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:03:21):&lt;/a&gt; But then of course, it sounds like the Concorde maybe wasn't the appropriate thing for them to be working on. What do you see as the dividing line between the types of projects that a government, and really, almost only a government can do, and the sorts of things that should be left to the market and left to human ingenuity?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010339&quot; id=&quot;010339&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:03:39):&lt;/a&gt; Infrastructure, I think, is certainly the main structure in our network, because if you have a network of highways or trains, or ... You need to have the power of government to expropriate eminent domain. And because when you acquire of right of way for a road or a train, you are supposed to pay market price for the land. But it's not the market, because if somebody doesn't want to sell, this person is obliged to sell, because the parcel of land is on the right of way. You don't have a choice to buy another piece of land, so it's not really market.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010423&quot; id=&quot;010423&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:04:23):&lt;/a&gt; So that, I think, the government has a monopoly on this possible acquisition of land. And that's why they are better at developing infrastructure. But when it comes to selecting technology, I think they are not so good. And that's what bother me with global warming, is that very often now governments are selecting technology other than giving ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010452&quot; id=&quot;010452&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:04:52):&lt;/a&gt; One good example of government action is DARPA, in a way, or some project of DARPA, where instead of selecting the technology, they define the performance. Performance is let's say, &quot;We want a vehicle which will be self driving in the desert, 100 miles, and that's the speed that is requirred.&quot; And that's the only thing they define... And you have enough firms that compete ... And they give a price to the firms or researchers who fulfill the requirement.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010519&quot; id=&quot;010519&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:05:19):&lt;/a&gt; I think that's a good investment on the part of government. But mostly, I think that government could invest not in technology, but in fundamental research, for which there is no real market. And fundamental research now, we know in science, eventually we will have consequence for very, very useful and commercialized technology.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010544&quot; id=&quot;010544&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:05:44):&lt;/a&gt; That makes sense. So it sounds like the line here is infrastructure that requires something like eminent domain, or requires coordination at a level that private company really couldn't provide. Because I think I would say that internet access and something like Minitel to me seems like infrastructure, but what you're saying is something like that doesn't actually require nearly as much coordination as building a train track, because the train track has to cut through land that already exists whereas the internet system doesn't have to do that as much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010619&quot; id=&quot;010619&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:06:19):&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah. And if you have a server or a tower or something, you can move it wherever you want. I mean, you have some requirement, it has to be a certain location, but you don't have an absolute location. Where sometimes, for instance, if you have a water plant or a sewer treatment plant, there is usually an optimum location for it, for environmental reasons. So then you have to use eminent domain for it. But those, of course, could be after that could be operated by the private sector. But the initiative has probably to come from the government.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010702&quot; id=&quot;010702&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:07:02):&lt;/a&gt; I know the Japanese train system is almost entirely private, or entirely private. And I always wonder, since they sort of operate like the government, and I'm sure that the Japanese government does have a lot of communication with them about how things work, I've never totally understood how those public/private partnership type things work. Can you speak a little bit to that, and how decisions are made by private companies?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010727&quot; id=&quot;010727&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:07:27):&lt;/a&gt; The water company in France has always been private since ever, for some reason. So the government of course regulates them, because it's a utility and they have a natural monopoly. But they operate it privately and competitively. The same with the highways. There is a network of highways in France which was entirely developed privately, although the rights of way were acquired by the government and let's say, linking which city to which other city was decided by government ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010801&quot; id=&quot;010801&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:08:01):&lt;/a&gt; But as soon as the design was done, it was entirely built and operated, and is still now operated, privately. So they are all toll roads, by the way. All the highways in France have toll roads, and they are private toll roads. And one problem has been in developing country, where the government is usually rather ineffective. They are very weak, technically. The people who have a lot of technical skill very often go in the private sector, not in the government.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010838&quot; id=&quot;010838&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:08:38):&lt;/a&gt; So there have been a tendency at the beginning with the financing by the WorldBbank to say, &quot;Well, why don't we ask the private sector to operate like France's water supply, or develop a water supply system?&quot; And it has not been very good, because if the government is not good at supervising this, this public/private partnership, then it's a complete disaster because you have a private monopoly,  and it doesn't work very well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010912&quot; id=&quot;010912&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:09:12):&lt;/a&gt; So in a way, it's only country where the government is pretty competent that you can increase the efficiency by introducing the private sector. If you introduce the private sector in a monopoly situation like the water supply, for instance, but with a very weak government, you will end up with a pretty bad result.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010936&quot; id=&quot;010936&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:09:36):&lt;/a&gt; Although I suppose if you keep the water supply under the care of the government, when the government is weak and perhaps corrupt as well, that's also probably not a good outcome. So maybe ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010947&quot; id=&quot;010947&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:09:47):&lt;/a&gt; The only good outcome is to, of course, reform the government. And then you can maybe consider having a more efficient system by having ... But let's if the reason for privatizing is because the government is weak, it's too early to do it. The outcome is not good. So the outcome is not good either way, if as you say, the government operate it then it's not competent. It's not very good.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011015&quot; id=&quot;011015&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:10:15):&lt;/a&gt; What are the specific steps that you've seen weak governments take to reform themselves to solve this problem?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011021&quot; id=&quot;011021&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:10:21):&lt;/a&gt; I think it comes slowly, through democracy and information. I don't think there are steps, magic steps that you can do for ... The press has a role to play. For instance, I have seen in India where there is really a free press, and very kind of dynamic. The press have pretty good journalists who are really digging into a problem like water supply or transport, or even building regulations. And they do a pretty good job, and eventually, they have enough middle class who read the newspaper and read those technical article so that it create a constituency for reform and better services. So I think that this is ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011102&quot; id=&quot;011102&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:11:02):&lt;/a&gt; But it's a long thing. It's not something you do in three years or four years. And it has, in a way, very little to do with the amount of money you put in it. The World Bank has tried many time to reform governments, to give incentive either by paying them more, by training, by all sort of thing, to have better government in country which had weak government. And it has to come from the people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011131&quot; id=&quot;011131&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:11:31):&lt;/a&gt; It sounds like a recurring theme here, is that you can make a lot of infrastructure changes and they might make a difference. But if the people don't really care for it, or if the cultural norms say that something is low status, then they're not going to use it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011146&quot; id=&quot;011146&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:11:46):&lt;/a&gt; You mentioned in some middle income countries, owning a car is a big status symbol. Maybe you could make the buses as nice as you want, but those people are probably going to keep driving their car because it sort of heightens them and makes them feel good about themselves, and separates them from other people. So you have to change the culture before you can really change the infrastructure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011207&quot; id=&quot;011207&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:12:07):&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely, yes. I completely agree with that, yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011210&quot; id=&quot;011210&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:12:10):&lt;/a&gt; We're coming up on our time now, and I have so many more questions, so I think we're going to have to save the second half of this for a part two on the transportation topic. But this was so much fun, as always, and is there anything else that you two want to add before we sign off?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011226&quot; id=&quot;011226&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:12:26):&lt;/a&gt; No, thank you. I cannot think of, but I'm looking forward to the next set of questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011231&quot; id=&quot;011231&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:12:31):&lt;/a&gt; Thank you, Devon.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Michael Kaminsky recently emailed me &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kaminsky.rocks/2020/08/funding-open-source-projects/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;an interesting post he wrote about bounties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; in open source, and I took the opportunity to write up some thoughts that had been swirling in my head for a while. You can find the (lightly edited) response I sent to him below.&lt;div style=&quot;display: none !important&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/f3f6e085-0a69-4f2d-b840-8aa38aaf10a3/1bb7f484-d5fd-423c-b813-9a93c831d3a0.png&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bounties are great for well-scoped, low-context work. For example, bounties work can quite well for things like penetration testing, because it's fairly clear what the objective is (specifically: prove that you can wreak havoc on a system) and the task itself requires no collaboration with the core team of the project (in fact it's even better to have no collaboration, because that simulates a blackhat hacker's circumstances more closely).
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However I'm not so bullish on the idea of bounties for ambiguous, high-context work. And my view is that (A) ambiguous, high-context work is much more central to the success and innovation of any sort of project, not just open source ones, and (B) people with the capacity and desire to do ambiguous, high-context work are what open source projects tend to be most sorely lacking.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/f3f6e085-0a69-4f2d-b840-8aa38aaf10a3/e0bc1858-4d2f-444b-a212-54f1e1f1145a.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If penetration testing is on one extreme of the well-scoped/low-context spectrum, then defining the vision for a project is an example of a responsibility that lies on the opposite end. There are a lot of types of work in between that may benefit from something akin to bounties, and those are all valuable, but what I'm most eager to solve is &quot;how do we develop more leaders who can give life force to open source projects?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On top of that, there are some challenging dynamics around bounties. Just to name a few:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;A. Bounty allotment: &lt;/span&gt;Alice is the maintainer of Foo, and Bob is making his first contribution ever. Bob opens a PR to resolve an issue that someone put a bounty on, Alice reviews it, and then she merges it. Who gets the bounty? Does Bob deserve it as the author of the PR? Or does Alice deserve it as the maintainer who created/cares for the project, thus making it possible for Bob to create a PR in the first place? Do you split it in half?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One idea — You could solve this with a concept of equity, where the maintainer gets X% of any bounty and that's determined up front. Determining the right values that various folks get could be tricky, but perhaps the maintainers could just set that themselves from the beginning. This would have a very similar shape to startup founders deciding how much equity they get vs how much their employees may get. I'd need to think this through &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/span&gt; more before I actually recommended it as a solution, but it's a first pass!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;B. The spec isn't the territory: &lt;/span&gt;How do you determine if the bounty terms were met? Defining a spec is hard work, and it's never airtight. Plus, the best engineers will reframe a problem you pose rather than following exactly what you describe as a solution. This is a bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory&quot;&gt;the-map-isn't-the-territory&lt;/a&gt; type of problem. The only way to define a spec completely is to write the code yourself! Of course that's taking the problem to ad absurdum, but it underscores the main point that it could be tricky for the developer and bounty poster to agree to whether or not something was met.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;C. Race conditions: &lt;/span&gt;What happens if Bob and Charlie both work on the same bountied issue, and then open PRs on the same day? How does Alice choose whose PR to accept, and thus who earns the bounty? One way you could solve this is to tell contributors to &quot;lock&quot; the issue while they're working on it, but then what if they never finish it? Then, it just wastes everyone's time because no one else is working on that issue in the meantime.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;D. Honeypot for (more!) low-quality contributions: &lt;/span&gt;Lots of maintainers already say that they're flooded by low-quality contributions. (Lots more detail in Nadia Eghbals's recent book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/33Q1Wn2&quot;&gt;Working in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Highly recommended if you're interested in this topic!) Putting a price tag on issues would only accelerate this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This could be mitigated by making the bounties only visible to folks who are part of the project's organization, people who've already made contributions, or some other filter. My point is just that you'd have to think it through, not that it's a dealbreaker.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;E. Project coherence: &lt;/span&gt;Another failure mode is that bounties could warp maintainer's incentives and ability to execute on the best architecture. A maintainer might want to make one choice because it's a better architectural decision, but then a bounty for a particular feature that pollutes the roadmap is just too temptingly big. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even if a maintainer holds fast, it could incentivize more forks because other developers see that bounty just sitting there, waiting to be satisfied. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing, because then the org that posted the bounty is happy without polluting the main project. But it leads to fragmentation (which is sometimes but not always bad) and likely immense tension within the project.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I don't mean to be defeatist at all! These problems are probably solvable, but I just mean to call out that designing such a product would require a lot of care and subtlety.&lt;/div&gt;

It’s admittedly a nerdy topic: it’s about open source projects, roles and responsibilities; the rise of GitHub as a developer platform; and how developer culture is evolving around the new power of creator platforms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is mostly about software development, but the core insight of the book is bigger: Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;make things&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;, and how that’s changing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Looking back at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;the first heyday of open source in the 90s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;, you picture these loosely organized, squabbling, collaborative efforts between a closely-knit group of nerds. Some special technology, notably Linux, emerged from that era as evidence that self-motivated teams of volunteers could build world-class products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;One of the radical ideas from this period was that loosely organized, socially motivated volunteer communities could accommodate more useful contributors than formally managed teams. Traditionally, the rule in software engineering is that &quot;adding more engineers to a project makes it ship later&quot;, popularized in Fred Brooks’ 1975 book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; It makes sense: beyond a core team, adding marginal engineers to a task creates more costs (getting them up to speed, dealing with team complexity) than benefits (any useful output they manage to ship).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;The open source experience in the 90s violated that rule. Self-organized communities, coordinating via forums and email lists, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;learned how to accommodate hundreds of productive contributors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. We rethought Brooks’ law: if they’re all genuinely self-motivated, then the more the better; they’ll figure out how to make it work. The corollary to this understanding became: if you need to get more work done, go attract more contributors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Those lessons have carried forward to today, where open source has become so widespread we’ve dropped the name: it’s just &quot;The Ruby community&quot;, or &quot;the Python community&quot;. Eghbal writes: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;&quot;The default hypothesis today is that, faced with growing demand, an open source &quot;maintainer&quot; – the term used to refer to the primary developer, or developers, of a software project – needs to find more contributors. It’s commonly thought that open source software is built by communities, which means that anyone can pitch in, thus distributing the burden of work. On the surface, this appears to be the right solution, especially because it seems so attainable. If a lone maintainer feels exhausted by their volume of work, they should just bring more developers on board.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, for many maintainers, that collaborative mindset no longer reflects reality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;&quot;However, in speaking to maintainers privately, I learned that [initiatives to bring on more contributors] caused them to seize with anxiety, because such initiatives often attract low-quality contributions. This creates more work for maintainers – all contributions, after all, must be reviewed before they are accepted. Maintainers frequently lack infrastructure to bring these contributors into a &quot;contributor economy&quot;; in many cases, there is no community behind the project at all, only individual efforts.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Something important changed between the 90s and today. If you look at most open source projects now, the distribution of who’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; the work versus who’s simply &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; is skewed dramatically: it’s common to see projects where 95% of the work is done by a nucleus of people, perhaps even a single developer, with a long tail of &quot;contributors&quot; who are really more like users or consumers: they might offer occasional pull requests, or flag some issues occasionally, but they’re more like fans watching a football game than the main players. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;&quot;Fans&quot; is a useful comparison. They serve an important purpose, they’re excited about the project, and they want to be a part of it. It’s like how fans of a band want to &quot;be a part of something&quot;, while understanding it’s not really their show. You’re happy they’re there; the point of creating open source code is sharing it, and there’s no better sign that you’re doing something useful than fans showing up. Fans are your distribution. But fans are costly. They want to engage with you; they need interaction, and they need your time. Having more fans is great, but it doesn’t make your life easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Today, the natural constraint on open-source projects has become like an upside-down Tragedy of the Commons problem. The classic commons problem involves a self-renewing but finite public good, like the town green for grazing animals. Here, the commons at risk of being overdrawn isn’t the product; the code itself can be consumed limitlessly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;The risk is that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;creators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; become overdrawn and overwhelmed with participation, and with demands on their time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You’re a performer, and you’re on stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

How did we go from Brooks’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Mythical Man-Month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;, where adding more contributors were a net cost, to the 90s source ideal where adding new contributors magically worked, and then back to this new present situation, where they’re a cost again?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Here’s where we get to the real insight of the book, which isn’t actually an insight about software. It’s an insight about the relationship between creators and platforms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;If you go back to the 90s, when we first figured out how communities built software, it took a lot of work to use the internet. It wasn’t fast or easy, but that made it special: it meant that everyone on the internet cared about it, a lot.

The tapestry of forums and newsgroups that made up the early internet flourished for a while, but in the 2000s an invasive species arrived: the platforms. The platforms made it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; easy to create, share, distribute and discover that everyone joined them, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;smushing everything together into common, user-friendly formats without the local context or nuance of the smaller groups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Before GitHub, open source communities didn’t only differ in their social conventions and quirks; they also differed in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; they did the work; specifically, in how they managed something called version control while developing software. Once you’d identified your favourite way, you’d likely stay loyal to the projects who used it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;GitHub changed all that. In platform fashion, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;GitHub started with a simple and convenient set of tools for hosting and version control, but quickly grew into a network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;If open source before was like a cluster of distinct villages, GitHub was like a highway connecting them all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;: developers loved it, because GitHub made it easier to create &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; distribute &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; discover. It quickly became the standard way you interacted with projects, and with other developers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Go check out projects! Make some pull requests! Get involved, be humble, and ask to learn!&quot; With no friction associated with joining or leaving a project, popular projects would get immediately overrun with &quot;help&quot;, but see little real benefit; only irritation and burnout for maintainers, overwhelmed by all of the well-intentioned but short-lived visitors. Developer Nolan Lawson described his experience in the book as &quot;a perverse effect where, the more successful you are, the more you get ‘punished’ with GitHub notifications.&quot; It’s Brooks’ law again, bizarrely reincarnated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Rather than the users of forums or Facebook groups, GitHub’s open source developers have more in common with solo creators on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or Twitch, all of whom must find ways to manage their interactions with a broad and fast-growing audience.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a production factor; it gets things done. And yet, in the creator’s mindset, code is also unmistakably &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. There’s a cost to making it, and there’s a cost to making it big; but that cost is not because marginal consumption itself is expensive.

This all takes work, and it’s often not the kind of work the creators like doing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Shows create their own success: fans create more fans, just like product use creates more of itself. Conversely, if no one’s at your show, no one will go next time. If no one uses your product, it won’t improve. There’s no business on earth with a greater divergence of outcomes between the winners and everyone else.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Show business, in a nutshell, is the art and science and orchestration that happens &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; the show that keeps those emotions renewed, and not exhausted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;It feels strange to juxtapose these two kinds of vocations. Making technology seems like a world apart from entertainment and show business. But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;in this new world, making &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; show business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. Look at what founders do all day! And I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. It’s hard work to create a product, create attention, and then – most importantly – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;manage that attention so it feeds you momentum but doesn’t burn you out. That’s the hard part of show business; the part they don’t tell you about. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;The hardest thing to do is to create, and then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;keep creating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. The people who make the greatest impact are the people who can keep creating, one thing after another, growing in impact each time. If you look at the world’s great makers – Elon Musk, Beyoncé, whoever you like – they don’t stand apart because of their raw talent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;They stand apart because they’re able to sustain their creative output for year after year. They manage to keep shipping and compounding their success while leveraging the show around them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Platforms reward that skill set. At their extreme, it becomes the primary thing that matters.  Does that mean &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; making will trend this way? Not necessarily; it’s a choice. But it’s a choice we make lot. Startups begin and grow within the context of a local scene, not unlike the way bands get started and level themselves up. Many modern tech companies have an average employee tenure of around 2 years; this would be disastrous for an older company or community, but in this new creator-driven model, it’s w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;hat we’ve optimized for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;In the old world, you maximized engagement and retention of your community by giving them trust, and giving them context, and making them peers. Platforms make it easier to create &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; discover &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;distribute, but at a cost: too many people, too much attention, and too little friction to join or leave. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;The cost of platforms is less overall trust, and less overall context, for everyone but the core nucleus. Instead of fighting that tradeoff, we accept it: we find new ways to build, like microservices, which make it easier for low-trust, low-context participants to be productive anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;You can see what’s happening here: it’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgba(0, 230, 181, 0.4); font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;We Shape our Tools, and They Shape Us (and then We Shape Our Tools Again)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Our desire to create and discover leads us to build tools and platforms that make creation and discovery easier. This dramatically levels the playing field for participation, and you get way more participants, but they’ll be coming in without context, and without trust. So we adapt in order to make them useful anyway: software is getting more modular, more plug-and-play, and less monolithic. It’s not necessarily better software, but it accommodates the way we build now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Working in Public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; is a great book, because it walks you through in detail how the software community implements this philosophy in practice. It’ll be everywhere, soon enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr style=&quot;height: 0px; margin: 1.8rem 0px; border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); width: 160px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); box-sizing: border-box; clear: both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Like this post? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://danco.substack.com/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;Get it in your inbox every week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt; with Two Truths and a Take, my weekly newsletter enjoyed by 20,000 people each week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Natan Gesher sent me the following email after reading my post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/why-is-flaking-so-widespread-in-san-francisco&quot;&gt;why flaking is so widespread in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought you all might find it interesting too:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw your blog posts about flaking and wanted to share something I've observed from moving around a bit (four years in Manhattan for university, then two years in Jerusalem, five years in Tel Aviv, two years in San Francisco, three and a half years in Manhattan, one year in Seattle and finally the past two+ years in Manhattan): &lt;span class=&quot;my-highlight&quot;&gt;topography seems to have an effect on how people meet each other, make friends and form friend groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, in cities with a lot of hills (in my experience Jerusalem, San Francisco and Seattle), &lt;span class=&quot;my-highlight&quot;&gt;neighborhood identities tend to be stronger, it's more difficult to meet new people who don't live in one's own neighborhood and therefore it becomes more important to move to the neighborhood that matches the identity one has (or wants), and friend networks within neighborhoods tend to be more stable&lt;/span&gt;. This could be considered &quot;cliquey.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In flat cities (in my experience, Manhattan x3 and Tel Aviv), however, neighborhoods are more fluid, it's easier to meet new people from every neighborhood in any neighborhood and therefore it becomes less important to live in a specific neighborhood than to be within strategic commuting distance of everywhere / wherever interesting things are happening, and friend networks turn over more rapidly. This could be considered &quot;transient.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've hypothesized that hills within a city may impose a certain psychological barrier - despite the physical barriers that are so easy to overcome with modern forms of transportation - preventing people from wanting to transcend them, and that neighborhood cultures in hilly cities persist longer over decades and absorb new members more thoroughly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For me, living in the lower Haight was the only time in my life that I seriously considered buying an automobile of any kind, a Vespa scooter. In retrospect, though it would have helped my commute, I don't think it would have made any difference for me socially, because the barrier that the hills represent is cultural and psychological, not really geographical. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dan Wang and Brian Lui also had some interesting reflections on that same post, which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/re-flaking&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;--inversion-type-color:  simple; color: rgb(140, 140, 140); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;It also includes one of my favorite stories I've heard from the Alain and Marie-Agnes — but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say it includes appendicitis, a dwindling supply of Novocaine, and a Yemeni surgeon who'd never operated on &quot;a Christian&quot; before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000012&quot; id=&quot;000012&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:00:12):&lt;/a&gt; Welcome to the third episode of the &lt;i&gt;Order Without Design&lt;/i&gt; podcast. I'm Devon, and in this series, I get to talk to Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud, the most interesting couple I know. They are experts in urban planning, and they also have the most extensive experience of living in cities all around the world of anyone I've ever met. You can go back to the first episode for a longer introduction to the Bertauds. The topic of our conversation today will be sanitation and public health, and how decisions about this infrastructure shape our cities. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thanks for joining me again. I always look forward to these conversations. Let's get started.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000049&quot; id=&quot;000049&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:00:49):&lt;/a&gt; To me, the smell that characterizes New York City the most is its famous hot sidewalk trash. Disney World, by contrast, has a high tech system of pneumatic tubes that whisk away trash to a central sorting area, so Disney World is a magical land devoid of stinky curbside trash bags and noisy garbage trucks. My question is what stops New York from implementing a system like Disney World?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 130px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/b94f2568-076c-41bb-a7ba-a925d5a6ac97.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 130px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/fcb17feb-8a1d-4cfc-b234-73a8f099c044.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/2f34727d-240c-44fa-8230-21fea627e8f2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000112&quot; id=&quot;000112&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:01:12):&lt;/a&gt; I think in Disney World the type of trash which is put in the trash is tightly controlled, not so much by the staff, but by the type of people who go there and what they have to throw out. It's not domestic trash. But by the way, I know two cities which have this system which is operating. One is Barcelona. It's operating only, I think, in one neighborhood, at the East of the Gothic Quarter, and the other city, strangely enough, is in India. It is in Ahmedabad. It is a new business neighborhood where they have implemented that, and I even visited the infrastructure, the detail of the tunnels to see how it works and all that. It is possible. The only thing that I don't have here is how much does it cost per kilo of trash collected, and how often does it break down?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 472px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 472px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 472px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/7ebfb9ee-4ee7-411a-a0e2-7a69aee05fc6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 472px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/16b48a9e-ee43-4b2f-bc2f-85ecdc1bed50.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Most of Barcelona is not served by a fancy pneumatic tube system. Most neighborhoods in the Spanish city put their trash outside in large bins, which are more attractive than NYC's street trash but don't smell all that much better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000203&quot; id=&quot;000203&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:02:03):&lt;/a&gt; In Barcelona, the inputs are limited because, obviously, it kind of looks like trash can, but the size is very limited, so you cannot throw, I suppose a sauce pan or a piece of wood or something, such as an old piece of furniture, but that's I think what limit us there. It's an enormous capital cost to start the whole thing. The other thing is I think it would be difficult in New York as I learned recently that there is no map of everything which is underground in the city. I mean, no accurate map. You have a lot of cables and pipes and things like that, which when you dig, you must detect where they are, and it takes a long time. It costs a lot of money. That can explain only partially why the new subway took so long and costed so much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000250&quot; id=&quot;000250&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:02:50):&lt;/a&gt; Do other cities have maps like that, and is New York sort of special that it doesn't have one?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000254&quot; id=&quot;000254&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:02:54):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. New York is special.&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/6d741eac-2710-4f64-9ff5-f2e3b5aaf456.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000256&quot; id=&quot;000256&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:02:56):&lt;/a&gt; In Australia, they have a very interesting system for the underground system. When we were visiting Sydney in city center, we could see all the cables located in underground tunnel well distinct from one another’s and inserted in tubes. Technicians maintaining the systems have an easy access to their networks making the necessary changes, adding other connections and cables.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000326&quot; id=&quot;000326&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:03:26):&lt;/a&gt; That's really interesting. If I'm hearing right it sounds like the fact that they designed the manholes and the traps so that it was easy to get in and to understand what's going on, it allows for more change in the future and more maintenance?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000339&quot; id=&quot;000339&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:03:39):&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Yes. Of course, it's extremely well-mapped. This is a very important aspect, the mapping.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000346&quot; id=&quot;000346&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:03:46):&lt;/a&gt; What predicts whether a city will have good mapping and good design to enable maintenance and innovation moving forward compared to something like New York? Why did New York [inaudible 00:03:56] map this way and Sydney end up that way?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000359&quot; id=&quot;000359&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:03:59):&lt;/a&gt; I don't know. I would have thought that probably extreme decentralization of power like you have in the United States do not allow very much standardization of mapping and things like that, but maybe I'm wrong, because Sydney is probably also related to Anglo-Saxon system, so it is not very centralized either. I am not so sure. In France, which is contrary to the United States, a very centralized power. Of course, mapping is a monopoly of the state, and therefore, everything is done according to a National standards... The mayor has very little to do with it. It's done by the central government. They have a mapping agency, and they do all the mapping, including within the city, so they probably oblige the utilities to provide them their drawing to map them. I assume so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000448&quot; id=&quot;000448&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:04:48):&lt;/a&gt; That's super interesting. One thing that also makes Disneyland and Disney World different from New York or really any of these other cities is that the whole thing is owned by one corporation, and so they're able to internalize all of the externalities, where if you have a more pleasant trash system, if it doesn't smell like trash when you're walking around Disney World, people are going to enjoy their experience there more as well. Do you think that there's anything to learn from that, in the context of cities, or is that something we'll only ever get in a private development?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000516&quot; id=&quot;000516&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:05:16):&lt;/a&gt; No, I think that there is a lot to learn about it. I'm not sure which is a solution, but I think that, as you say, to internalize externalities like that is something very important, and a corporation can do that, because they see it at the bottom line at the end of the year. A city has also a bottom line, but it is less obvious what will be the benefit, let's say, for a New Yorker of not smelling the garbage. Will it have an influence on property values, for instance, or things like that?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000550&quot; id=&quot;000550&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:05:50):&lt;/a&gt; You could study that, but it's not as obvious to measure. For a corporation, of course, they certainly have to do some regulation to find their bottom line at the end of the year is due to smelly trash or something else, but it's still more obvious to them. Probably, there should be some indicators developed in cities which can mimic the bottom line of a private corporation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000615&quot; id=&quot;000615&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:06:15):&lt;/a&gt; For New York, what do you think is the most likely scenario for... Maybe they're not going to have fancy pneumatic tubes like Disney World, but what would be the best paths forward so the streets stop smelling like trash at 8:00 PM?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000627&quot; id=&quot;000627&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:06:27):&lt;/a&gt; I think there are traditional garbage removal system, which work better than in New York for some reason, and I am not so sure what it is. Again, if we go back to Sydney, the center of Sydney, the density in office building is relatively similar to Manhattan, some part of Manhattan, and you never see the garbage, and you never smell it. The other traditional garbage system with trucks which come and... But they are probably better designed. There is a better system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000658&quot; id=&quot;000658&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:06:58):&lt;/a&gt; I have seen also city like Seoul, where they have a very strict discipline in putting the garbage in the street and the truck coming. The coincidence between the two is in minutes or maybe 10 minutes maximum, so again, the garbage is collected immediately. It doesn't have time for dogs or even people to look into the garbage and spread it into the street.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000722&quot; id=&quot;000722&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:07:22):&lt;/a&gt; I believe it's Seoul where they have music that plays, right? They play some song, and then it tells people to come out with their trash bags and to put it in the trash. Is that correct?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000732&quot; id=&quot;000732&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:07:32):&lt;/a&gt; I think that's correct. I remember once I was in a small street in Seoul, which appeared to be purely pedestrian, and the street was entirely filled by outdoor restaurant. There was an indoor restaurant, but all of them are on the sidewalk and even on the street they have tables. It was mostly seafood, so the seafood produced a lot of garbage and the very smelly garbage  decomposed very quickly, so they have to remove it quickly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000759&quot; id=&quot;000759&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:07:59):&lt;/a&gt; While I was sitting there with my friend, suddenly, again, there is a sound, and there is a garbage truck coming. But already before that, the owner of the restaurant knew that the truck was coming exactly at what time by the minute, and he starts pulling the table out backward to let the garbage truck pass, so we have to move, but it was so routine that it was very orderly. There was no panic or anything. Then the garbage truck arrived, loaded stuff, and within a minute, we were back sitting at the same table, in the same place, and the truck has gone further away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000837&quot; id=&quot;000837&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:08:37):&lt;/a&gt; So that requires, of course, an enormous discipline and also organization. It means that the truck have to come really... if they tell the restaurant, &quot;We are coming at 8:35,&quot; it mean that your truck have to come at 8:35. If it comes at 8:50, it's becoming a mess.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000853&quot; id=&quot;000853&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:08:53):&lt;/a&gt; The collection of garbage in an apartment building is more complex. Each family is supposed to compress their garbage before throwing them in the dump. The garbage collected by apartment building is at some point controlled for their volume and weight and a charge is applied to the tenants. Maybe this is also a good way to have less voluminous garbage and being more careful separating items before disposing them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000934&quot; id=&quot;000934&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:09:34):&lt;/a&gt; We have also, for example, in France, the triage for selecting garbage. If you live in an apartment or any other places, even in a small town where we go for vacation, you have on the corner of every two or three blocks, different types of containers for disposing the garbage.  Paper, newspapers, glasses and plastics are to be dumped in different binds and you need to separate the organic garbage such as vegetables from the others refusals. The general collection in a village is done once a week.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001025&quot; id=&quot;001025&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:10:25):&lt;/a&gt; I could imagine having that measurement and sort of more of a direct knowledge of where the trash goes and which bin to put it in probably makes you more careful about how much you do, especially if you're paying by the pound, you're going to be sort of incentivized to generate less trash. I've also seen some... I don't remember the details, but there was some study that showed that people who had a meter that showed how much electricity they were using in their house and just counted how much electricity they used, they ended up using significantly less.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001053&quot; id=&quot;001053&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:10:53):&lt;/a&gt; Now, of course, there's probably some confounders there, where if you're the type of person who has a measuring device in your home, you probably are a little bit more sensitive as well, but just having that measure probably makes a significant impact of your perception on the trash and how much you consume of the electricity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001108&quot; id=&quot;001108&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:08):&lt;/a&gt; I'm sure that's a big factor. Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001110&quot; id=&quot;001110&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:11:10):&lt;/a&gt; I know that one big difference between New York City and Chicago is that Chicago's grid was laid out with some alleyways. Whereas, New York City has, I think, only one alley in the entire city, and so in Chicago, they're able to put their trash in alleyways, as opposed to just sitting on the sidewalk. Is that something that once you've designed the grid, you're basically just never going to be able to make that change and New York City is forever stuck not being able to implement the solution that Chicago has done?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001137&quot; id=&quot;001137&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:37):&lt;/a&gt; I think, Yes. Once you have divided the limit between private and public, you can never change it, unless you are a dictator, like Napoleon III at the time of Haussmann or Chinese... Now, the Chinese government is doing that in all cities. Suddenly, they're redesigning the entire part of some cities existing thing, but only the Chinese government can do things like that. I cannot imagine in a democracy that it could ever happen.&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/0747ab2c-1830-4a8b-b841-a52833b60901.jpg&quot; width=&quot;164&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Our son (3 years old) responding to an urgent need in the Toltec ruins of Tula, Mexico in March, 1970. An example of lack of sanitation!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001206&quot; id=&quot;001206&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:12:06):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, there's something deeply sad there, where you get stuck in a local optimum, but you can't really go back and change it, because it will ruin people's lives.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001214&quot; id=&quot;001214&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:12:14):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, it's like the QWERTY keyboard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001216&quot; id=&quot;001216&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:12:16):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Exactly. Everyone's now learned how to use this keyboard, so you're not going to go replace it, even if there's something more efficient.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001223&quot; id=&quot;001223&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:12:23):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. The cost will be very high.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001226&quot; id=&quot;001226&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:12:26):&lt;/a&gt; That actually leads me to a whole category of questions about greenfield projects versus brownfield projects. What I mean by that is greenfield being the projects that maybe you're starting a new city in an empty lot or an empty area, and there's no rules, no one really cares, no one has laid claim to it yet, versus brownfield, which is when cities already exist. Maybe it's San Francisco and you're trying to improve bike lanes or something like that. Of course, you just mentioned Baron Haussmann in Paris, and that's the most extreme, or at least one of the most famous examples of someone coming to an existing city and completely changing how the place worked. How do the circumstances of having an existing community change the problem of trying to implement change and implement improved sanitation and infrastructure?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001313&quot; id=&quot;001313&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:13:13):&lt;/a&gt; Ninety-nine percent of the case when you have a problem like that is in an existing city. New cities starting from scratch are very extremely rare. I'm not talking about suburban expansion, because they always rely on existing infrastructure somewhere. But starting cities from scratch, the way the Saudi are doing now, for instance, one or two, is extremely rare. When you have an existing city, you have to deal with the city and their solution, after all. Most of the city we know, whether it's London, Paris, or Rome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001345&quot; id=&quot;001345&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:13:45):&lt;/a&gt; Rome is exception. Rome had sewers. The sewer, by the way, which was built by the Romans, the Cloaca Maxima. I think it was built in something like 100 BC, the first branch, is still used today. The Romans, by the way, were exceptional in putting infrastructure in cities, including water supply. You still find in area occupied by Rome in France, the [inaudible 00:14:12] Roman area, a relatively small city at the time of the Roman cities, which were about 10,000 people, and they had a very elaborate aqueduct system to bring clean, fresh water to the city, and they had a sewer system. For some reason, this was abandoned in the dark ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire, and it took nearly 1,500 years to put them back the way they were at the time of the Romans.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001436&quot; id=&quot;001436&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:14:36):&lt;/a&gt; These problems are social as much as they are technical. What social solutions did the Romans figure out that we had lost later?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001444&quot; id=&quot;001444&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:14:44):&lt;/a&gt; I don't know why the Romans were so interested in sanitation. Is it that they had some plague in Rome sometime or something like that? I don't know. It seems to be a cultural thing. I remember, for instance, in Morocco, there was a project to build a sewer system without running water. They got water from wells. Every sewer expert say it cannot work, because to have a sewer system, you need a minimum amount of water flowing into it, and if people collected from wells, it would not work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001517&quot; id=&quot;001517&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:15:17):&lt;/a&gt; It happened that the Moroccans insisted in doing it, and the system worked. It will not work in any other city. It means that the people themselves have such a cleanness, so they, in fact, extracted much more water from the wells, because for their domestic use, they were consuming much more water probably not only for cooking, but certainly for washing, that they made the system work. So, you see, within North Africa, you see a lot of difference in cleanliness of cities, and it's not necessarily related to income. It's related to very old traditions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001553&quot; id=&quot;001553&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:15:53):&lt;/a&gt; In all of the cities that you've lived over traveled, where did you have to make the biggest adjustments in your standards of sanitation?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001601&quot; id=&quot;001601&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:16:01):&lt;/a&gt; In Yemen, because there was no water supply, no sewage, very little electricity, and the roads, most of the roads were not paved, the infrastructure was in fact very limited. For water supply, we did have a  well. Some people would dig next to their well a septic tank supposed to collect the dirty water. So, with the proximity of the two wells, the dirty and clean water will mix after all and you have to carefully to use a filter your drinking water. Even so our water been filtered we will take the precaution to boils it to kill any germs and drinks mainly tea. Concerning the toilets, few houses had flushing toilets and the local people had another ways or go in the field or in the street.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001708&quot; id=&quot;001708&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:17:08):&lt;/a&gt; I think that there they had the traditional system, where the Yemeni, especially in Sana'a, live in towers. They build the higher possible building, and they live only in the second or, third higher floor, so their bathrooms were close to the top, and whether it was... Let's go into the detail.  , what human produced in the toilet would evacuate through a hole in the wall and drip along the façade. There was no  pipes. Only a special shallow grove along the façade. It would drip slowly and most of the time dry-up before reaching the ground. In Sana'a or in Yemen in general, the plateau being fantastically dry, the thing would evaporate before it reaches the ground. The solid things would also dry up and converted into dust and fall in the street, which is probably not very hygienic, but at least you do not have something smelly and gross in the street. I'm sure that this had an impact.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001803&quot; id=&quot;001803&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:18:03):&lt;/a&gt; So, you have a toilet system, which was quite elaborate, but it was based on evaporation, and therefore, on very little consumption of water. They start putting water system when we were there. It as the World Health Organization (WHO) who did it, the WHO that US has canceled its participation in just recently. When they did it, it created a lot of problems, because people start consuming, of course, much class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;more water as soon as they have running water in their house.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 259px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 259px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 259px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/1b26d93b-403b-4038-a087-85d3130831f5.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&quot;A traditional house in old Sana'a where toilet pipes had been installed just along the area where &quot;things&quot; used to drip.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 259px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/21829d10-4be2-430b-8bf6-a3381f1b2e89.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&quot;Marie-Agnes illustrated how traditional Yemeni bathrooms worked. The water and everything else are evacuated through a hole in the facade and slowly drip in the sun and usually dry before reaching the ground.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;For rich people who could afford a pump in their well, then a pipe is added to bring the &quot;effluent&quot; directly into the street. The sewers started being built in Sana'a only after we left in July 1973.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001834&quot; id=&quot;001834&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:18:34):&lt;/a&gt; The system was not ready to absorb all this water, so it fell on the streets, which is mostly clay. The clay, when it’s dry, is extremely good foundation for building, very solid, but as soon as it is wet, it is a terrible foundation. So, a lot of buildings start cracking, buildings which were several hundred years old, which had very solid, strong foundation start cracking, because under the foundation, the clay was becoming humid because of the lack of sanitation. Unfortunately, WHO did the water supply before the sanitation. Again here, it was a political decision. Their priority is to get water, not to get sewer, but the more water you consume, the more sewer you need, of course.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001921&quot; id=&quot;001921&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:19:21):&lt;/a&gt; Because you need a place to collect it so that it doesn't just soak into the ground.&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/f3af877f-6cc9-465b-b8f8-b88054c744bd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;601&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A facade in Sana'a with the water pipes and toilet pipes installed as a faced ornament.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001925&quot; id=&quot;001925&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:19:25):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yeah. Either it's absorbed by the ground and then it affects foundation, or then it flows on the ground, and this is what's happening in a lot of slums in the world, where the main streets are, in fact, open sewers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001938&quot; id=&quot;001938&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:19:38):&lt;/a&gt; I imagine that can't be good for the water quality either, right? Because now you no longer have that evaporative effect, where everything just dries up and it doesn't really get mixed in. Now, the solids that come out of the window or whatever, they land in the water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001952&quot; id=&quot;001952&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:19:52):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. The wells we had, that Marie-Agnes mentioned, were 30 meters deep. That's nearly 100 feet deep. You see, it was pretty deep, and it was dug by hand, by the way. You have people... It was a job to be a well digger, so they will dig and practically every six months, we will have to call somebody to dig another meter, because the water table was going down constantly. In the beginning of our stay, most people could not afford a pump and used  a rope and a bucket. Suddenly, more people had electric water pumps, which of course, then  consumes much more water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002025&quot; id=&quot;002025&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:20:25):&lt;/a&gt; So eventually, I think, the water table after we left was lower and lower, and eventually, the municipality start digging very deep wells, but according to the geologists, those wells were, in fact, fossil water. It was water, which was below a layer of volcanic basalt, so this water was, in fact, not renewed. It was not part of a water table. It was just there in the same way as oil or something like that is there underground. It was fossil. The day they consume all this fossil water, it will never be renewed, and they will be completely out of water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002103&quot; id=&quot;002103&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:21:03):&lt;/a&gt; Will they all just be forced to move?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002105&quot; id=&quot;002105&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:21:05):&lt;/a&gt; Yemen, the plateau has a tail of a monsoon, so they have a wet season that lasts about two months, where you have thunderstorm, but it's very sudden. Unless they have a system to recover all the water which falls without too much evaporation, my guess is that they will never have enough water to support the current population. At the time we were there, the entire population of Yemen was evaluated at five million people. Now, I think it's something like 30 million. That makes a lot of difference. At the time, the consumption of water, of let's say an average Yemeni family, was something like 35 liters per capita per day. Now, for people who can afford water supply, it's probably 130-150 liters per capita per day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002156&quot; id=&quot;002156&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:21:56):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. So it's really accelerating, and they're going to have to figure something out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002200&quot; id=&quot;002200&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:22:00):&lt;/a&gt; Just to give you an order of magnitude, in California, a household... I'm not talking here about industrial consumption of water, households consume around 400-600 liters per capita per day. In Europe, the average in cities is around 200-225.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002218&quot; id=&quot;002218&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:22:18):&lt;/a&gt; Why is it so much higher in California than in Europe?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002221&quot; id=&quot;002221&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:22:21):&lt;/a&gt; My guess, I don't know, you wash your car a lot and water your lawn. Maybe you take more showers. I don't know. Or you drink more water and less wine. I don't know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002231&quot; id=&quot;002231&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:22:31):&lt;/a&gt; That might explain it, especially between the French and the Americans. What was the personal impact on your life of having different access to infrastructure for sanitation and water?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002241&quot; id=&quot;002241&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:22:41):&lt;/a&gt; You have to be more careful, and we had two young children at that time, everything was very, very controlled. I would check what they will eat, washing their hands very often, making sure that they didn’t eat anything that falls on the dirt since Veronique, our younger child, was still crawling on the floor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It’s another story when we were in New York. We were living in an apartment, and some tiles felll around the kitchen sink. Yann, our little boy, only one years old, started to eat these things crawling on the floor. Anyway, they were cockroaches, but he thought it was dry raisins, and he was putting these into his mouth, that was not to be too good. Maybe the cockroach in New York are less dangerous!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002338&quot; id=&quot;002338&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:23:38):&lt;/a&gt; There was a funny story like that. At the time, Marie-Agnes was still learning English, and she didn't know the word cockroach in English, so after those tiles fell off and the floor was full of cockroaches, she immediately went to the drug store, but she looked in the dictionary to find which is the English word for cockroach. In French it's cafard, but cafard has two meaning one is somebody who is sanctimonious,  pretending to be holy but a hypocrite, and the other is a cockroach, which is called cafard, so she look at the word, and she took the first meaning, which was sanctimonious.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002412&quot; id=&quot;002412&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:24:12):&lt;/a&gt; So, she goes to the drug store, and she says, &quot;I have a lot of sanctimonious in my house. Do you have something against them?&quot; And so, the guy says, &quot;Lady, I don't know what you're talking about.&quot; After that she came back. When I came back from work, she says, &quot;We must be the only people with cockroaches in New York, because at the drug store, they have never heard of those animals.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002436&quot; id=&quot;002436&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:24:36):&lt;/a&gt; That's hilarious. I remember when we had dinner a while back, you mentioned that you had appendicitis while you were in Sana'a. Can you tell that story?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002445&quot; id=&quot;002445&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:24:45):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. I was working for the UN, and the UN had a doctor in Yemen who was an Italian, who has been disbarred, or would you say a doctor who cannot exert in Italy. He has been literally kicked out of Italy. We didn't exactly know why, but so he exerted only in Yemen, and he was a very nice guy, very learned man, but obviously, medicine was not his forte. He told us also that he had a disgust for blood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002512&quot; id=&quot;002512&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:25:12):&lt;/a&gt; Suddenly, I had a lot of pain in the bottom of the stomach, and I went to see him, and he say, &quot;Well, you have certainly appendicitis. You need to probably be operated here, because it could become very serious.&quot; So he said, &quot;I know only one surgeon which is worth in Sana'a, and he's a Hungarian. He's working in a military hospital. Why don't you go and see him? So, I went to see this Hungarian, and he received me in his bedroom. He had a bedroom in the hospital, and his office was his bedroom. He looked at me, and he said, &quot;Well, it's better to operate right away,&quot; so he told me first, &quot;We don't use general anesthesia here, because we tried and we could never wake up the person, so we don't do it anymore.&quot; So he say, &quot;With you, we'll have just Novocaine. I'll give you a shot of Novocaine, but it's not very comfortable&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002604&quot; id=&quot;002604&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:26:04):&lt;/a&gt; So we got to the operation room, which was an ordinary room, and for the Yemeni, it was interesting, because they all told me, &quot;This is the first time we operate a Christian&quot; .The Yemeni divide the world into Muslim and Christians, and they thought that maybe the inside of a Christian was different. By the way, the Chinese also, there werecalled Christians and there were a lot of Chinese in Yemen at the time. Quite a number. There was a large Chinese embassy, and they call them Christians, too, which was probably not the case,as it was the time of Mao.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002634&quot; id=&quot;002634&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:26:34):&lt;/a&gt; They knew also that foreigners were a little keener on hygiene than the Yemeni, so during the entire operation, there was somebody was brooming the room saying, &quot;We want to make sure that everything is clean.&quot; Basically, it was not really an operation theater. It was a room with a table, and I laid down on the table, and people were holding me. So the surgeon start with his assistant, and they start operation. He told me, &quot;Okay. Novocaine.&quot; So he asked his assistance, &quot;Novocaine,&quot; and the assistants tell him, &quot;Well, Novocaine, ma fish! There is none.&quot; So the surgeon turned to me and say, &quot;Well, I told you local anesthesia, but we are running out of Novocaine, so if you agree, I will do the operation without anything.&quot; And what can you say?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002717&quot; id=&quot;002717&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:27:17):&lt;/a&gt; He asked me, &quot;Are you nervous?&quot; And I say, &quot;Well, no. Go ahead.&quot; So they proceeded with the operation. I found it very, very painful, and I was glad when it was over, but the advantage of it was I recovered very quickly without anesthesia. Anesthesia is a shock. I recovered very, very quickly. Four or five days later, I drove my Land Rover and things like that. That was okay.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002742&quot; id=&quot;002742&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:27:42):&lt;/a&gt; Oh, my goodness. Marie-Agnes, what did you think of all of that?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002745&quot; id=&quot;002745&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:27:45):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. When the doctor says, &quot;I will operate,&quot; and told me, &quot;We cannot let you in,&quot; so I'd say, &quot;Okay. Fine.&quot; I went back home, gather bed sheets, towel, soap and some changes for Alain, still hoping that he will not stay too long in the hospital. When I was back he was already in his hospital bed. He just stayed there for few hours and we were back home where our environment was cleaner than this poor military hospital. Alain did recovered after few days.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002841&quot; id=&quot;002841&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:28:41):&lt;/a&gt; What was the risk of infection?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002843&quot; id=&quot;002843&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:28:43):&lt;/a&gt; Probably high, but I was lucky. Maybe being born in Marseilles, I have kind of an immunity against infection. I don't know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/45f9aa45-eb7c-49c7-a9d2-06c02385def3/066e6e33-6a30-4344-b85b-cae55598ca29.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&quot;During the war (1942) to avoid the bombing in Marseille, my family moved to the countryside in a tiny hamlet where they rented a house without running water (but a spring nearby) or electricity. My sister Mireille and I, shown on this picture took our bath in a metal tub outside where the water was preliminary warmed by the sun! before winter came, we moved to another much more comfortable house further away in Auvergne, but where the fight between the resistance underground and the Germans was fierce.&quot; — Alain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002851&quot; id=&quot;002851&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:28:51):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. What a story.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002853&quot; id=&quot;002853&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:28:53):&lt;/a&gt; When I was born, we were living in the center of the city. We were also filtering water. We had a filter for water. We will not drink the water from the tap. Never. But we were filtering water, because the water was supposed not to be very clean, but my mother was a chemist, insisted that we brush our teeth with unfiltered water. She thought that we would develop an immunity like that by having very small dose of unclean water. I suppose that this probably protected me when I traveled. I'm very, very seldom sick when I travel, and I don't take any precaution. For instance, if I visit the slum and people offer me water, as a matter of principle, I drink it. I don't refuse it. I drink it, because out of courtesy, and I am never sick.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002939&quot; id=&quot;002939&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:29:39):&lt;/a&gt; I went to Bangalore in India about two years ago now, and I walked around the city, as I usually do, and to be honest, I didn't even consider the fact that a lot of people get sick when they go to India, and I just ate all the food off the street. There was this one point where I bought curry in a plastic bag, and I ate it with my hands, and I drank all the water, and I didn't get sick at all. I came back, and I mentioned this to a friend, and he was just like, &quot;What were you thinking? That could've turned out really poorly.&quot; Do you think that Americans and Europeans sort of overrate the risks, and that maybe I didn't get so lucky and actually it was fine, or do you think that that was maybe a bad decision and I should've been more careful?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003017&quot; id=&quot;003017&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:30:17):&lt;/a&gt; No, I think that you took the right decision. I think that's American. My experience is that Americans are more sensitive to, let's say, bugs in the water than the Europeans, by the way. I found that in the World Bank  where teams  were multi national, but still dominated by Europeans and Americans, and the Americans get sick much more often than the Europeans. I think that Americans probably live in a much more antiseptic world than the Europeans do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003048&quot; id=&quot;003048&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:30:48):&lt;/a&gt; When did Marseilles get clean tap water that you didn't have to filter? When did that change?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003053&quot; id=&quot;003053&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:30:53):&lt;/a&gt; I don't know after I left the city. I don't know. Now, they don't have filters, but... No, maybe not. It must be... Yes. When we moved in a new apartment in '47, we didn't have filters, so it was probably in the central neighborhood where we still had bad water, so it was just after the war when we start having clean water, I suppose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003115&quot; id=&quot;003115&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:31:15):&lt;/a&gt; What usually precipitates a city upgrading its water system so that you don't need a filter anymore? Is there sort of a defining moment?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003123&quot; id=&quot;003123&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:31:23):&lt;/a&gt; Cholera and plague. In Marseilles, we had an epidemy of cholera in the 19th century, I think, the last one, and it significantly improved things. I've seen it relatively recently in a city called Surat, which is an old city in India in Gujarat, and the city was particularly badly managed, and the bank tried to finance water supply and sewage, but the city was so corrupt and badly managed, we could never get a project going. Suddenly, they had a very bad cholera epidemic. The people then became very, very upset with their own municipality, and within two or three years, suddenly, Surat government became one of the most efficient in Gujarat, and they start having a sewer. Now it's a city which is very well-managed and has a good sewer and water system. So it was a cholera epidemic, which I don't remember now how many died there were, but it was like medieval plague at the time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003224&quot; id=&quot;003224&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:32:24):&lt;/a&gt; Tragically, it often takes a really serious crisis for something like that to change. One of my favorite books is called &quot;The Ghost Map,&quot; and it's about London during the 19th century, when they had a massive cholera epidemic. They had also the disadvantage that they didn't know what cholera was. They thought it was just caused by bad smells, as opposed to something in the water itself, but now that we have better understanding of how cholera works, and I guess, by we I mean science knows this, but do you think that the thing that causes cholera in the world still is people not understanding where it comes from, or is it more the corruption and the inability of municipalities to respond effectively?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003305&quot; id=&quot;003305&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:33:05):&lt;/a&gt; I think it's a capital cost. The obvious thing is water supply and sewer, to separate the two. Most people in many cities still now get water from wells, and obviously, when the density gets high, they are prone to get cholera, so you need certainly an enormous investment, a capital investment. That means you cannot do it incrementally really. You have to do a lot right away to build sewers and to build the water plant also to distribute the water. This is an enormous capital cost.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003338&quot; id=&quot;003338&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:33:38):&lt;/a&gt; If you have a city which do not have access to credit, who cannot issues bonds, this is nearly impossible to get all this capital in a few months or in a few years, so it's really this type of problem. That's why in Yemen, this was financed by WHO, the water system first, and later they did the sewer, but after we left. So the WHO provided  the money, and certainly, the Yemeni had to pay some part of it, but probably no more than 10% or 15%. If not, Sana'a would have gone without any sewer system for much more many years without WHO.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003415&quot; id=&quot;003415&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:34:15):&lt;/a&gt; It sounds like the investing in that water supply and also in the sewage was probably the right thing for Sana'a, but they didn't do it in the right order so that they wouldn't create further problems. Would you agree with that, or do you think it would've been better if they had actually just stuck with their more traditional methods?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003431&quot; id=&quot;003431&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:34:31):&lt;/a&gt; No, the more traditional method was incompatible with a higher water consumption. As soon as you have electricity, and by the way, electricity was privately provided in Yemen. Nowadays when electricity come... It was entrepreneur who will have a generator, and they would ask the neighbors, &quot;Do you want to participate?&quot; It will cost that much per kilowatt or something, or you pay a lump sum, and you were connected by this generator.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003458&quot; id=&quot;003458&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:34:58):&lt;/a&gt; As soon as you have that, you have electricity, you can extract water from the ground. You multiply your consumption of water immediately, because you are not limited by the bucket you draw from the ground, especially if the water table is low, like it was in Sana'a, 30 meters. Suddenly, you multiply the consumption of water, and then you need absolutely a sewer system to take care of it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003522&quot; id=&quot;003522&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:35:22):&lt;/a&gt; Now, it's also this electricity thing increased the difference between poor and rich, because the rich can afford electricity. The poor cannot. So the poor still have a very low water consumption, which probably is not very good either, in terms of personal hygiene, washing clothes, and things like that. Some of my colleagues in Yemen, working for the municipality, were very poor. At that time, I don't think they washed their clothes more than two or three times a year because of the cost of water and soap and things like that. You get a lot of infectious disease because of clothes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003600&quot; id=&quot;003600&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:36:00):&lt;/a&gt; Some people even think that the improvement of health after the renaissance in Europe was not due to improved sanitation or medicine, but it was due to the emergence of cotton underwear, where people had cotton underwear that they could wash. So that's not eliminated, but decreased very much the amount of parasites which were living in clothes that you never wash.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003626&quot; id=&quot;003626&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:36:26):&lt;/a&gt; I find this also fascinating, because I think when we think of health, you usually think about what kinds of drugs can I take, what kinds of therapies can I have when I have a disease? Certainly, those are incredibly important and have lengthened lives and improved the quality of life, without question, but I think there's this much quieter but possibly more impactful thing, which is public health infrastructure and norms around cleanliness and just knowing... I brush my teeth every night. Most people didn't do that for most of history, I think, and the result is your teeth fall out within a few decades. What sorts of things can a municipality do, besides putting in sewers and sort of the obvious, to push a society towards healthier norms?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003708&quot; id=&quot;003708&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:08):&lt;/a&gt; I think that, in a way, I think it's opposite. It's society which evolved and pushed municipality toward healthier norms. I think it has to come from the people. Usually, the elite will try to protect themselves, so their neighbors will be a little better serviced, and then they realize that if they want to manage their health, if half of the city has cholera, and they cannot protect themselves against cholera, even if they have a good sewer system, so they are ready to expend money to expand the sanitation system to their entire city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003742&quot; id=&quot;003742&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:42):&lt;/a&gt; Health is really a collective good. You cannot be healthy in a city where 50% of the people are unhealthy, so it's probably something which is very important. But again, I think it has to come from the people. I don't think that a city itself, just because you have some technocrats who will demonstrate rightfully that a sewer system or a water system will improve the health of the people, that the municipality then will invest the taxpayer money in a sanitation system, unless there's a strong demand already among the people for it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003816&quot; id=&quot;003816&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:38:16):&lt;/a&gt; A recent example that's quite extreme, of course, is in San Francisco right now, they're responding to COVID by putting homeless people in individual hotel rooms so that they're not interacting with each other and spreading the disease out on the streets. This is something that's been quite controversial, as I understand it, because it's expensive to put people in hotel rooms, but on the other hand is this massive external, where if, let's say we &quot;solve COVID&quot; in the general population, but it's still running rampant in the homeless population, it's only a matter of time before it hops over to the rest of the people as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003851&quot; id=&quot;003851&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:38:51):&lt;/a&gt; I don't know about the cost-benefit calculus. Maybe they're putting them in the fanciest hotel in San Francisco. Maybe that's not the right cost-benefit analysis, but I think it points to this problem exactly of, when it comes to health, we're all in it together, and we have to lift everybody else up, because otherwise, you end up getting stuck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003911&quot; id=&quot;003911&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:39:11):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yes. Absolutely. This is a very good example of this problem. Health is a public good. You cannot separate it. One illustration of that in this time of COVID-19, Edgar Poe's short story called, if I remember well, &quot;The Masque of the Red Death.&quot; It's a story of a bunch of noblemen who try to insulate themselves from the red death. They wall themselves in with a lot of provisions, and they make parties all the time. Suddenly then, the red death appears among them. You cannot protect yourself, even if you are very rich and build walls against bad health.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003946&quot; id=&quot;003946&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:39:46):&lt;/a&gt; This is where the cities intervene. I think the homeless, what you suggest, the example you take here about the homeless in San Francisco is exactly that. People realize that they cannot protect themselves if the homeless remain very vulnerable to the virus.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004004&quot; id=&quot;004004&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:40:04):&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, if it gets bad enough, the super rich will tend to completely opt out of a system. You see this with schools as well, where if a public school system gets bad enough, basically anyone with money will put their children into private school systems, because they just don't want to deal with it. I can't say I blame them. You want to take good care of your children.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004025&quot; id=&quot;004025&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:40:25):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. It's not the same thing, though. Yes, it's true for of a school system. You can have a two-schools system, but health, you cannot protect yourself. If you have a part of the population which has a contagious disease in a chronic way, you cannot protect yourself, no matter how rich you are. Where, for education, yes, you can have a system of education, which is wonderful, and the other lousy, and in the long run, it will, of course, affect society, because you'll have more criminality and certainly less efficiency, if you have only an elite which is educated and the other which is not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004101&quot; id=&quot;004101&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:41:01):&lt;/a&gt; But this will be longer run problem. In the short-term, it appears that a very good education for your kid and a lousy education for everybody else is okay, that in the short run it's a benefit, but it's only in the long run that it is not. For health, it's different. I think health, the short run benefit of solving the problem is very clear.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004122&quot; id=&quot;004122&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:41:22):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Because even the richest people it the world can't go enjoy downtown New York City anymore. They're not going to the West Village and watching comedy shows anymore. That's done for everybody.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004132&quot; id=&quot;004132&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:41:32):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. You see, you cannot live only among very rich people. You need people to prepare your food, do things like that, and if they are unhealthy, you are going to be unhealthy yourself, especially... I'll say, there's a difference between infectious disease and chronic disease. If they have a chronic disease, if they have heart condition or a bad liver, it's okay, but if they have an infectious disease, like COVID-19 or cholera or something like that or amoebas, you are going to get it yourself, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004202&quot; id=&quot;004202&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:42:02):&lt;/a&gt; That was the case with tuberculosis. This sickness was very contagious and we were to isolate the people with tuberculosis, not putting them in a hotel like the homeless, but in sanatorium, a hospital specialized for the care of TB patients.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004223&quot; id=&quot;004223&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:42:23):&lt;/a&gt; How did that turn out? I actually don't know that much about the history of TB.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004226&quot; id=&quot;004226&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:42:26):&lt;/a&gt; In my generation, our generation, I had a lot of friends who had tuberculosis. I had the beginning myself, by the way, but it was cured very quickly. That was the generation who grew up during the war. There was no medicine. There was shortage of food. There was a lot of things. So when you were in high school, if somebody had tuberculosis, the kid would disappear, and they will send him to a sanitarium, usually in the Alps, in the countryside, where they will live among kids who had tuberculosis. They would be completely separated from their parents. It was like a boarding school, and they lived among them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004259&quot; id=&quot;004259&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:42:59):&lt;/a&gt; When I became a student, then I realized among my friends, there were two or three or four of them who had been in those sanitariums and survived. They were different, by the way, from other kids. They more well-read. They had read more books than we had, because most of the time, they were in a bed with nothing to do in the countryside, so they were reading much more. They were much more intellectual, but you imagine those kids told me that about 50% of their friends will die. On their bed, you see a sheet, and they are gone. So they were very different. I still have kept contact with one of them, actually, that we see from time to time.. This, of course, has completely disappeared from the world, but it existed not so long ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#):    Because of the vaccnaio&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;id=&quot;vaccnaio&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:43:45):    Because of the vaccination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004347&quot; id=&quot;004347&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:43:47):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. Vaccination and penicillin. Penicillin was not used yet completely. So that's something maybe we are very old, so we remember this time, but I was struck by that. By the way, the students who were formerly in the sanitarium, their permanent identity... It was on their identity. When we were at university, we had special restaurant for students who had tuberculosis, and they had this special restaurant with better food, because they have been through that. In a way, they were marked for life. We knew about it. Usually, they didn't hide that they had tuberculosis. Actually, they even... I won't say they bragged about it, but they recognized that it gave them a special personality.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004429&quot; id=&quot;004429&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:44:29):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. That's really interesting to hear about the cultural difference. I mean, when I think about children who are growing up right now... You mentioned that your friends who had tuberculosis were generally much better read. We're going through a terrible thing right now, so I want to preface everything that I'm saying with that, that I don't think it's a good thing that COVID-19 exists. I am very interested to see how the children growing up during this period end up turning out differently, because there's a year or two of their life where they don't go to school in the normal, and they maybe are going to be more self-directed in their learning, and they're socialized differently, because they don't get to go to the movies with their friends. How did you feel like the kids who grew up with tuberculosis ended up behaving differently when they were adults?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004514&quot; id=&quot;004514&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:45:14):&lt;/a&gt; Difficult to generalize. I had about four or five of my friends who had tuberculosis when I was a student. Two of them were close friends, so it's difficult for me to generalize. But it has an enormous impact on their life. But it's different, I think, with what is going to happen now. I think that it will have an impact, but completely different, because here, when they had tuberculosis, they were a small group of people, they lived separately from their parents, and many of their close friends would die. They realized they were different from others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004541&quot; id=&quot;004541&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:45:41):&lt;/a&gt; Now, here it will be everybody. An entire generation will be different. The only thing, maybe, which will make a big difference between them is income. Again, the kids who have access to the internet and have parents who can maybe guide them there, and kids how have no access to the internet and have parents who cannot guide them, and suddenly they are cut out from socializing or anything, I have no idea what the impact could be, but it could be portent, I'm afraid.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004609&quot; id=&quot;004609&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:46:09):&lt;/a&gt; This situation will increase the difference between the children belonging to affluent families and the poor children who are left by themselves when parents can hardly provide what they needs for their education such and a computer and access to high speed internet specially when remote learning may be the norm. We will have a lot of problems following the Covid-19 pandemic. We don't know what will be the consequences, but definitely we will see some big changes in our society.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004708&quot; id=&quot;004708&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:47:08):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. I can imagine being able to send children to school means that every child gets some minimum of attention and some minimum of educational resources, and perhaps, public schools are not the ideal method for teaching people, but at least it's something. Whereas, this is going to increase variance, where I personally had parents who were very interested in my education and gave me a lot of books growing up, and so I think I would've loved staying at home and reading instead of going to school. I think I would've learned more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004736&quot; id=&quot;004736&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:47:36):&lt;/a&gt; But on the other hand, there are other children in the school that I went to, who their parents were not very interested in their education, or their parents were very busy and couldn't really give them those resources. Yeah. So I don't think they would've necessarily benefited from this at all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004752&quot; id=&quot;004752&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:47:52):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, I agree entirely on that. Yeah. I benefited also from parents who were very educated, very attentive to what we were doing, what we were studying. By the way, comic books were forbidden in my home. I read only comic books when I was going to the barbershop. That was the only place where I could read comic books. I didn't like to have my hair cut, but I would go as often as I could just to read comic books.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004815&quot; id=&quot;004815&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:48:15):&lt;/a&gt; Marie-Agnes, you grew up in Tunisia. What was it like if there was ever a medical emergency in your family or someone was feeling sick? What does your family do in those circumstances?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004826&quot; id=&quot;004826&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:48:26):&lt;/a&gt; Yes it was a particular situation. My father was working for the French government as an engineer, doing the logistic servicing the boats in the Navy base. We were having access to a well run hospital for the military personnel and the civilians working for the Navy. I was born as my siblings in this hospital and we had no real problems concerning our health, because we had access to the best care. Contrary to the poor Tunisians who were having access only to dispensaries that provided a very minimum medical care. This really made a big difference.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004916&quot; id=&quot;004916&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:49:16):&lt;/a&gt; When we moved from Tunisia to Algeria, here the French government was doing much more for the local population, the Algerians. People were more educated. Many of them will speak perfectly French, where in Tunisia, the Tunisians were speaking mainly Arabic. The Algerians have access to decent schools and hospitals. My mother was a nurse at a dispensary caring for the people in a very poor neighborhood. People appreciate very much my mother services as a nurse. Here too we were having access to the best care possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#:9 id=&quot;=&quot;#:&quot;:9)&quot;&gt;D class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;evon (00:49:59): &lt;/a&gt; That sounds like a good situation. Yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005001&quot; id=&quot;005001&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:50:01):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005003&quot; id=&quot;005003&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:50:03):&lt;/a&gt; To change tack a little bit, I was reading a little bit about the Black Plague earlier today, the Black Death, and how it impacted cities. I'm curious, since you both have a lot of knowledge about history, how did European cities change as a result of the Black Death?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005018&quot; id=&quot;005018&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:50:18):&lt;/a&gt; Well, apparently, according to historians, the Black Death was, in fact, it created the end of feudality, because it created a labor shortage. One of the best books about this period, by the way, is written by an American, the historian Barbara Tuchman. It's called &quot;A Distant Mirror.&quot; It's a story of Europe and mostly England and France in the 14th century, so at the time of the plague. It's probably one of the best books about society at the time that I have seen, and probably, if you are interested, I would strongly... Barbara Tuchman, &quot;A Distant Mirror.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005058&quot; id=&quot;005058&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:50:58):&lt;/a&gt; It's based on she has been digging into journals, memories, literature of the time, and it's the most complete description of society reacting to both historical and event, and of course, the plague is one of the big part of it. So yes, it had a very big effect. Because of the time, it's difficult to know for sure what was the effect. I suppose that this idea that it's ended feudality, because suddenly, labor became much more important than anything else, because there was a shortage of labor. It's probably true. I have no idea if this current COVID will have an effect on society like that. I don't know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005141&quot; id=&quot;005141&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:51:41):&lt;/a&gt; Just the scale of the Black Death is totally mind-boggling. In five years, between 1347 and 1352, the Black Death killed 40% of the population, which I think COVID is not on track to hit 40%, thank God. But it was really interesting, I was reading this paper this morning about how it talked about how in the short term it led to depopulation of cities, but actually, in the longterm, they found that settlements in rural areas that were far away from cities actually ended up seeing much more depopulation, even though they had lower instances of the Black Death.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005216&quot; id=&quot;005216&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:52:16):&lt;/a&gt; They looked into why that was, and the hypothesis is basically that as depopulation occurred throughout the entire continent, people from rural areas saw better opportunities in the cities after the plague ended, so they moved back into the cities when they might not have previously, because the wages were higher. So it actually ended up encouraging mobility and moving people into the cities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005238&quot; id=&quot;005238&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:38):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. I think it's very likely. Don't forget they were serfs, too. At the time of the plague, many farmers were serfs. That means that they could not move from their farm freely. They were not slaves, but they were serfs. They were attached to the land. The way they kept the system in Russia until 1860, I think, where they abolished it, the farmers were attached to the land, so when you bought the land, when a feudal lord bought the land, it came with people, and the land has no value without the people. The labor was very important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005314&quot; id=&quot;005314&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:53:14):&lt;/a&gt; The plague apparently abolished the system of serfdom. The cities, at least in France, were under the protection of the king against the lord, so a lot of cities in France are still called Villefranche, free city, and because probably many of them were formed at the time of the plague, where serf just evaded the service of the lord and went into cities, where they were protected by the king. Then they will become bourgeois of the city. They will have a job in the city, and their life will not be dependent on some lord.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005350&quot; id=&quot;005350&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:53:50):&lt;/a&gt; But if you look at the Middle East, more than the plague, I think there were two periods where the invasion of Genghis Kahn... That was earlier. That was the 13th century. Genghis Kahn was a nomad, and he has complete contempt for cities, and he destroyed many of the very brilliant civilizations. After that, you had the plague, which also ravaged East Asia and the Middle East, but we don't have so many numbers on it, precisely because Genghis Kahn has destroyed so many things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005422&quot; id=&quot;005422&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:54:22):&lt;/a&gt; After the plague finished, then you have Tamerlane. Tamerlane was a Turkish Mongol who was also a nomad against cities, and he destroyed Baghdad. He destroyed Aleppo. His goal was not to conquer. He had the contempt for city life. He thought that nomads with herds were the only noble life. So the Middle East and the Far East up to China resisted better, but the country in between China and Europe were completely ravaged by these two warriors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005457&quot; id=&quot;005457&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:54:57):&lt;/a&gt; What's interesting is that their descendants created dynasties which created cities again. This culture of destroying cities was only the founder of the dynasty. After that, the Timurid, most of India Mughals were, in fact, created by the descendants of Tamerlane, who created a very brilliant urban civilization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005517&quot; id=&quot;005517&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:55:17):&lt;/a&gt; What you said about the nomads conquering places and trying to impose their way of life, but then ultimately, creating great cities in later generations reminds me of a quote from a book called &quot;Against the Grain,&quot; where the quote goes, &quot;You can conquer a kingdom on horseback, but to rule it, you have to dismount.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005534&quot; id=&quot;005534&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:55:34):&lt;/a&gt; Ah. Ah, that's excellent. Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005537&quot; id=&quot;005537&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:55:37):&lt;/a&gt; So they end up turning into city people, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005539&quot; id=&quot;005539&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:55:39):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. The descendants of Tamerlane who created the dynasty was called the Timurid, and they created the fantastic architecture of Samarkand that is being seen now, so it was inspired by Persian architecture, but they developed their own.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005554&quot; id=&quot;005554&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:55:54):&lt;/a&gt; One public health menace that people know about but I think continually have underrated throughout history is malaria. I'm curious, how has malaria impacted the evolution of cities, and what sorts of solutions have people come up with that try to reduce the impact of malaria?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005610&quot; id=&quot;005610&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:56:10):&lt;/a&gt; Well, less stagnant water. In the south of France, we had malaria up to the end of the 19th century. For instance, at the time where Vincent van Gogh, who waspainting in Arles, there was malaria and all at the time during the 19th century, people going to Rome on the Grand tour were often catching malaria. Malaria was eventually eradicated by drying up marshlands in cities. You still probably had it still in the countryside for some time, but then it disappeared from Europe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005646&quot; id=&quot;005646&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:56:46):&lt;/a&gt; In the Middle East, you still have it, but it's a much drier... In India, you still have malaria in India, and of course, in Africa, but it's not completely solved yet. In humid countries, it's very difficult to have only dry land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005703&quot; id=&quot;005703&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:57:03):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, the Gates Foundation have these mosquito nets that they distributed all over in Africa where malaria is current, and just that, sleeping under a mosquito net, makes the malaria almost disappearing and less common in this region of the globe. Now we have drugs, of course, to cure or temporize malaria symptoms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005728&quot; id=&quot;005728&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:57:28):&lt;/a&gt; Malaria is special as an infection disease, in the sense that the vector is a mosquito, and the mosquito, to propagate malaria, has to bite somebody who has malaria, so if you manage to eradicate malaria once in a population, then that's it, if nobody comes from another area which has malaria. It's a very collective thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005751&quot; id=&quot;005751&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:57:51):&lt;/a&gt; I was thinking of the Henry James novel. There is a Henry James novel... I forgot which one... which takes place partly in Rome, and it's a young lady who will catch malaria and die. At the time of Henry James, people thought that it was just a bad air of Rome. They didn't realize it was a mosquito. Around there were a lot of marshlands, which were dried up by Mussolini, by the way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005816&quot; id=&quot;005816&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:58:16):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Very much like cholera, there is actually some correlation, where things that smell bad tend to also correlate with bad water, or marshland has the standing water, also sort of is bad air, so they're not 100% wrong. There's something there, but the root cause is misunderstood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005835&quot; id=&quot;005835&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:58:35):&lt;/a&gt; That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005836&quot; id=&quot;005836&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:58:36):&lt;/a&gt; In the American South, especially during the history of pre-Civil War, when there was still slavery, the classic image of a plantation is of a big, white house up on a hill with a bunch of slaves and workers working in the fields below. I've learned that one of the reasons for that was because they didn't understand exactly where malaria came from, but they did understand that if they were on higher ground that was drier, and usually with a lot of sun, they would have less malaria, which I thought that was just fascinating. For me, that was always just a look, an aesthetic, and I thought that they put their houses up there just because it looks pretty, but no, it was because of malaria.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005912&quot; id=&quot;005912&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:59:12):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Right. Yes. Yes, of course. Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005914&quot; id=&quot;005914&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:59:14):&lt;/a&gt; How has the architecture in other places that you've been been affected by malaria or any other infectious diseases that people were trying to prevent?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005922&quot; id=&quot;005922&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:59:22):&lt;/a&gt; There was malaria in Yemen in the lowland, the coast of the Red Sea. It was endemic, but I don't see that there was any correlation with the architecture, that there was anything which would prevent people from getting malaria. Where it's endemic too in the south of India, there was a lot of malaria in Tamil Nadu, things like that, but it's a very humid country with a lot of ponds, so it's nearly inevitable that you will have mosquitoes, except probably people develop some kind of immunity, not complete immunity, but a lot of people resist better to malaria than people who come from Europe, for instance, probably.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010003&quot; id=&quot;010003&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:00:03):&lt;/a&gt; I wonder if there's other types of... Immunity may not be the right word, but sort of your body reacts, where I lived in Panama briefly in a rural town, and I noticed that the mosquitoes just loved me. My entire body was covered in mosquito bites. Whereas, the locals, the people that I was living with, had maybe one mosquito bite at a time tops, and I just wondered, is there something about my body and my skin that the mosquitoes like more. The locals would say that I had sangre dulce, which means sweet blood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010032&quot; id=&quot;010032&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:00:32):&lt;/a&gt; It's the same problem with Alain and I. Alain gets rarely a mosquito bite. Once we were camping in Yucatan Mexico, and here for some reason, the mosquitoes are of smaller size. They easily can pass through a mosquito net and as a result the children and I did walkup the next morning all red when Alain has no one bite.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010102&quot; id=&quot;010102&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:01:02):&lt;/a&gt; He just doesn't taste as good, I guess.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010104&quot; id=&quot;010104&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:01:04):&lt;/a&gt; They recognize a guy from Marseille. Stay away from him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010109&quot; id=&quot;010109&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:01:09):&lt;/a&gt; That's hilarious. I have two last questions before we wrap up. Last night I had a Zoom dinner with a friend who also lives in San Francisco. He lives not too far from me. He made the interesting prediction that San Francisco's already highly concentrated tech culture might become even more concentrated after the pandemic. What he meant by that was that there's sort of two rough groups of people in the tech industry in San Francisco.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010134&quot; id=&quot;010134&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:01:34):&lt;/a&gt; There's one group that cares really deeply about creating new businesses and being on the frontier of technology and social changes, and then there's another group of people who are very talented and skilled, but they're primarily there because there's kind of a gold rush right now, and there's a lot of economic opportunity, but they don't necessarily identify with those of Silicon Valley itself. What he was sort of claiming was that second group doesn't feel quite so tied to the city, and once the economic opportunity and the value of physically being there is not quite so high, they just leave. What do you think of that prediction?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010209&quot; id=&quot;010209&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:09):&lt;/a&gt; That's interesting. I never thought of that in that way. Yeah, it's quite possible, actually. There's no doubt that techies attract other techies. Well, you must know that. Yes. I never thought of that, but I think that's quite a possible scenario. Of course, I'm sure something will happen, some change will happen. We really don't know. We can make predictions saying, &quot;I think that.&quot; My prediction for cities is that some people will leave, but they will be immediately replaced by others, because the housing stock is still there, the attraction is still there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010244&quot; id=&quot;010244&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:44):&lt;/a&gt; The only worry I have about that is that the attraction of cities like San Francisco or New York is not only that you meet other people who are interested in the same thing as you are, but it's also that they are attractive in terms of a lot of café, restaurants, a lot of meeting place, where you are more able to have this random encounter that you may not find. The social life is very important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010309&quot; id=&quot;010309&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:03:09):&lt;/a&gt; Now, imagine that because of the hardship of trying to maintain a restaurant or café in New York or San Francisco that most of them close and get out of business before they can recover, and then during two or three years, you have streets boarding up, all these cafes are boarded up, there is nothing there, then suddenly maybe those cities lose a bit of attraction in itself. New York without the café and the commerce and the street can be very dreary, so I wonder...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010343&quot; id=&quot;010343&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:03:43):&lt;/a&gt; My recommendation for the municipality there is to remove all the very complicated zoning requirements. In New York, if you want to convert a small commerce retail shop into a restaurant, you have to have also to... It may take two or three years for the conversion to do it. If you do that, then you will ruin the whole thing. My recommendation is to allow zoning to have the type of zoning that you have in other countries, like in Japan, for instances, where this is any commerce which is not obnoxious... it's not a slaughterhouse or something like that... is allowed by right in a residential area. I think that's what New York should do and San Francisco, too, if they want to survive as an attractive city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010431&quot; id=&quot;010431&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:04:31):&lt;/a&gt; If you have during four or five years, cities which have no place of social gathering at all, that you have still condemned to meet your friends at home because there is nothing else or at the office, but our zoning law prevents this flexibility at this moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010448&quot; id=&quot;010448&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:04:48):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. Some cities are experimenting with allowing for easier permitting of using sidewalk space and that sort of thing. I wonder, though, what the magnitude of those changes are. I'm seeing all these articles that make me happy of cafes spilling out onto the streets, just like it was so hard to do before, and bike lanes coming out. But how big of an impact actually is that right now?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010510&quot; id=&quot;010510&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:05:10):&lt;/a&gt; I think it will be limited, because in New York, at least, eating outside is fine for about six months of the year, but six months of the year you can't. It's too cold, or it's too warm, or it's snowing. Then to survive, restaurant, it's a very competitive business, and to survive, they have to have the maximum number of clients, and suddenly, you decrease their client by half practically. It's a good idea to liberalize that, but I'm not sure that it will have such a big impact.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010540&quot; id=&quot;010540&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:05:40):&lt;/a&gt; By the way, when we arrived in New York in 1968, there were very, very few restaurants on the sidewalk, very few. I don't even remember any, actually. I was struck by that, compared to Paris, and those restaurants developed in the years after. It's interesting, it was eating on the sidewalk, which is, to me, very attractive, when the weather is good... much more attractive than being inside... is a relatively recently acquisition, I think, in the United States.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010610&quot; id=&quot;010610&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:06:10):&lt;/a&gt; I'm also a bit concerned about small businesses compared to big businesses. It seems like this sort of crisis on relative terms is better for larger businesses that have a lot of capital and money in store, so you might see all of these small businesses fold, and then the big chains can come in and take up the cheaper rents on the big streets. I have sort of a gloomy prediction that we're going to end up in a place where you walk down the street, and instead of seeing a bunch of charming, little local restaurants, you see a Taco Bell and a Chick-Fil-A. While I like my junk food just as much as anybody else, it takes away from the specialness of that particular city, of course, right? You can get a Chick-Fil-A in any state.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010651&quot; id=&quot;010651&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:06:51):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. I think the beauty of cities, and especially cities like New York or San Francisco, which have a relatively... The private space is divided into relatively small lots, so that allows the small restaurant, which is specialized in something, which does Basque food or something like that, or South Indian, and to survive, because it's a small... they catch it with small clientele, and it's a small thing, and I am afraid, yes, that the chain has a very big advantage. If the scenario you described, which is possible, happens, it will really make those cities much less interesting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010731&quot; id=&quot;010731&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:07:31):&lt;/a&gt; I guess having those smaller shops, where Tokyo being one of the most extreme examples, where the lots are really tiny, compared to, I'd say, San Francisco has bigger ones versus Austin, Texas, which has huge blocks, would you predict that the cities with the smaller lots will probably maintain small businesses better than the big ones?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010751&quot; id=&quot;010751&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:07:51):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. I think the size of the lot has a lot to do with it. Yes. That's one of my critiques with my Chinese colleagues. When they expanded the cities in China, they tended to give one developer a very large chunk of land. The city has a monopoly on land development, but when land is developed... Let's say the basic infrastructure is developed, then they auction the land to a private company, and instead of auctioning land by small lots, they auction them by very large lots, sometimes several blocks at a time to one company, and that, I think, is very detrimental to city life and the diversity we expect of a city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010832&quot; id=&quot;010832&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:08:32):&lt;/a&gt; One, I think of the major positive side of the grid in Manhattan was the size of the lot which were very small,.  So you can always, if you want to have a department store, you will aggregate those lots, but the unit is a small lot, and that allows a lot of variety and small entrepreneurs to try their luck. It doesn't mean that they will succeed, but eventually, there will be a Darwinian process. The more lots you have, again, if you follow a Darwinian process, the more initiative there will be, and some will be successful. Where, if you have few lots and you end up with a kind of an oligarchy of restaurants or services or commerce, which is not very good.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010915&quot; id=&quot;010915&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:09:15):&lt;/a&gt; Why do the planners in China tend to do bigger lots?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010919&quot; id=&quot;010919&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:09:19):&lt;/a&gt; Because it's convenient. If you auction the lot... Auctioning is a difficult process. You have to follow rules, and it takes time, so it's much easier to auction one square kilometer at one time, and you deal only with one person, than to auction this same one square kilometer, auction to 20,000 people. Twenty-thousand, it will be more difficult, certainly. Yes. But to the detriment, what is difficult is not necessarily bad.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010950&quot; id=&quot;010950&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:09:50):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Just because it's a little bit more difficult for the people making the decision doesn't mean that it's the wrong decision.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010955&quot; id=&quot;010955&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:09:55):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. And they don't see, where precisely if you see the older parts of the cities in China, the lots are small also, and that's part of their attraction is precisely that, that the lots are small, and therefore, you have this huge variety of commerce and especially restaurants. In China, there are many specialized restaurants and different types of food. That's possible, I think, only if you have small lots. Eventually, you'll have a large restaurant, which will acquire several lots. I'm not against sometimes large restaurants or even chain restaurants, but the unit should be a small.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011034&quot; id=&quot;011034&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:10:34):&lt;/a&gt; I wonder, if it's so much more interesting to have smaller lots, why don't these big developers who get multiple blocks go in and then create multiple smaller shops within that, if it's better?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011045&quot; id=&quot;011045&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:10:45):&lt;/a&gt; Well, it does happen in malls, especially, by the way, California. Usually they have anchors, having larger lot for something like Macy's or Bloomingdale or whatever, but they usually optimize within the mall. But somebody, a developer, was running a mall has a knowledge of what he wants or she wants for the mall, which is different from a developer with very often an intermediary who buy the land, and then will say, well, we will do office building there or we will do housing and try to simplify the operation at maximum, particularly there is a question of cash flow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011125&quot; id=&quot;011125&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:11:25):&lt;/a&gt; The operator of a mall is conscious that he has to attract people in this mall, customers,. They know that the customers have tastes which are changing, so they try to adapt to those customers. Where, I think that a developer in a large block in China is very often, by the way, it's a financial company. It's not somebody who has any experience in development, where the developer of a mall is very, very experienced in mall development. It's not somebody who's just saying let's do a mall there. They're very specialized. So this lack of knowledge, if it's a financial company, they say, well, we have already two or three takes for office building. Let us build just office building, and shops, in a way, are a hindrance to that. They will complicate things, so I think that's what happened.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011218&quot; id=&quot;011218&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:12:18):&lt;/a&gt; I have seen that also in India, by the way, this thing happen in large developments in India. In Delhi... Sorry. In Mumbai, in the '80s, they developed a new business center, which was extremely well-located in the center relative the city, and unfortunately, they decided that it will be a financial center, and they allow only banks or financial companies to locate there. There was never one... If you wanted to eat there, have lunch, you will have to take a taxi to go outside the zone, or you'll have to send somebody with a taxi to buy sandwiches somewhere else. It is still the case in this area whilein the rest of Mumbai there are a large variety of small shops of all sorts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011302&quot; id=&quot;011302&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:13:02):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. That doesn't sound like the most pleasant place to work, but then I guess if they measure it by economies of scale and efficiency, it's probably way better on some regards. But then they're not thinking about all of the other pieces that make up a day to day life, like I have to get lunch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011317&quot; id=&quot;011317&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:13:17):&lt;/a&gt; Well, I think it's a full vision of city. They come with one parameter, which is, yes, financial companies, they do better if they are next to each other. This model of Wall Street. That's fair enough. But they don't realize that you don't optimize a city with just one parameter. There are about at least 100 parameters to take into account. The same way as you could decide a city which would reduce the cost of sewer by 50%, but the sewer system is not the central part of a city. It's a very important, but you don't design a city around the sewer system. It's absurd.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011353&quot; id=&quot;011353&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:13:53):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yeah. I guess there's a lot of examples of cities that are over-optimized on one thing. The one that urbanists love to rag on, and I'll pile on right now, is when you optimize for through traffic, and you make it so that cars can cut through, it is good to be able to get to places quickly and not... But when it means that highways are now cutting through neighborhoods and making the place unpleasant, sometimes you have over-optimized on that one variable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011419&quot; id=&quot;011419&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:14:19):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Yes. That's why you have to keep your eye on markets in the wider terms. Markets is a way to balance all of these things together. That's why, in a way, the development of malls, the inside of malls, and the way land is allocated in a mall between small shop and large shop, restaurants and retail usually reflect the desire of the people. It does really reflect markets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011445&quot; id=&quot;011445&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:14:45):&lt;/a&gt; I suppose if you have that smaller granularity, then markets can work their magic more. Whereas, if it's at a bigger level, it's harder.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011452&quot; id=&quot;011452&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:14:52):&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. But that's not due to their design. It's due to retail. The anchors in the malls are usually Macy's, Bloomingdale, or... Those anchors are not doing very good business because of the competition or online shopping.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011511&quot; id=&quot;011511&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:15:11):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, but remember the Singapore mall. There, in Singapore the malls have not only retails, but you find also dental office, notary public, Kidengarden School, dispensary and all sorts of activities. Up to now and in general the concept of a mall in the US is for mainly shopping. You may have food court and some restaurants, but nothing like a real city where you have all sort of business.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011556&quot; id=&quot;011556&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:15:56):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. But those malls in Singapore are on subway stations, too. They are built around subway stations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011601&quot; id=&quot;011601&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:16:01):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, but the malls here in the US are on big parking lot, and many are now closing. More may be transformed to accommodate sort of Disney World with skating ring and amusement park like here in New Jersey.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011630&quot; id=&quot;011630&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:16:30):&lt;/a&gt; It's very interesting to see how malls in Asia... The ones I'm thinking of particularly are Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan. Those are the ones I'm familiar with. They have very different malls. Yeah, you got what you're saying, Marie-Agnes. They have a much wider range of activities, and so I imagine that they're a lot less fragile to macroeconomic changes or particular changes in a particular industry, because sure, maybe you're not buying as much clothing in a mall, but if you're still getting your notary signed or you're still getting your teeth cleaned from your dentist, you're going to still keep doing that foot traffic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011701&quot; id=&quot;011701&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:17:01):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Yes. I wonder if the zoning in our countries, the zoning is not for something in it. For instance, if a dentist wanted to settle in a mall, whether the zoning rule allow it, I don't know. I'm not so sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011716&quot; id=&quot;011716&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:17:16):&lt;/a&gt; The last question I'll ask and then let you get to your dinner is sort of a long one. We'll wrap it up after that. Shelter-in-place reduced the positive impacts of agglomeration, and this reduces the advantage of being in cities in the short term. I'm personally not in San Francisco right now. I'm in a house in the countryside, because my apartment in San Francisco is just one room. That was great when San Francisco was a thriving city where I could go see my friends, I could meet new people in my industry, but right now, I can't do that, so why would I stay in a super expensive apartment and not have a lot of space?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011750&quot; id=&quot;011750&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:17:50):&lt;/a&gt; So that's the downside. But on the other hand, I think there is a silver lining for this, which is that it is creating a more even playing field for people who don't have access to those cities. Like one example is that right now Zoom is the only way that I can interact with friends. The three of us had a video call a few weeks ago, and that was just lovely. We had dinner together. Usually, we would only have dinner if I came and visited you in New York, and sure, Zoom was possible all along, and we easily could've done it, but when it's sort of competing with the people who are physically around you, you're much less likely to do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011823&quot; id=&quot;011823&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:18:23):&lt;/a&gt; This is the preface of my question, which is if we're looking at the bright side of this gloomy picture, by reducing the potency of physical agglomeration in cities, what new opportunities does this create for people who don't usually have access to those opportunities, like for jobs and for social? How can we make the most of it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011842&quot; id=&quot;011842&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:18:42):&lt;/a&gt; It's possible that some of the people who do not have these opportunities have also little access to the internet, in the US at least, so their advantages reduce on that. But I think, too, that what you mentioned, if you go back to San Francisco now, you will have no opportunity to meet your friend in a restaurant, so you may as well be where you are now. This is temporary. I cannot believe that we will not find a solution or even get used to social distance or better hygiene, maybe, inside a restaurant, and that this will resume. I cannot believe that this COVID thing will completely eradicate several thousand years of urban civilization in one go.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011928&quot; id=&quot;011928&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:19:28):&lt;/a&gt; I totally agree. I plan to go back to San Francisco as soon as it's healthy to do so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011933&quot; id=&quot;011933&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:19:33):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yes. Yes. As soon as you can resume.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011936&quot; id=&quot;011936&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:19:36):&lt;/a&gt; But there is a positive things with Zoom. We are now connected with people that we will hardly have the chance to meet specially with the pandemic. Alain was in conference call with Moscow colleagues this week and with Vancouver. With Zoom we reconnected with my sister and my brother in Paris. We have now more chance to virtually connect with my family than we have before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012017&quot; id=&quot;012017&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:20:17):&lt;/a&gt; Totally. My job has been remote for a long time, actually. I work at GitHub, which has offices in San Francisco, but employees are all around the world, and most of my team are not based in California. It's actually wonderful in one sense, where the people who use the product that we build are all around the world. I think if my office were purely based in San Francisco and all of my co-workers were there, I would have less of a habit of talking to people all around the world, but because my co-workers are remote, too, I have this habit of using the Zoom call to talk to all sorts of different types of people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012053&quot; id=&quot;012053&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:20:53):&lt;/a&gt; I've had calls with users who are based in Zambia, in China, in the Netherlands, in New York. The list goes on and on and on. In a way, it has gotten me to think a little bit more broadly, beyond just the place where I live. Whereas, I feel like if my entire social life were entirely rooted in San Francisco, I might only talk to developers and programmers who are from California. I agree.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012118&quot; id=&quot;012118&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:21:18):&lt;/a&gt; I think my most optimistic prediction here is that we have learned through this new tools, and we have new capability to reach new people around the world, and then once we're able to all come back together, we will be even better than we were before. Because now, we can connect with people over really long distances and also see people face to face, so I'm hoping that it brings us together ultimately.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012140&quot; id=&quot;012140&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:21:40):&lt;/a&gt; That is very simple. Before, I was even reluctant to use Skype. I found Skype very often clumsy or didn't get the connection and the image was not good. I found that Zoom works very well every time. I think that the technology has improved, and certainly, Zoom will improve, too, over the years. That will be a positive side. In fact, we may gain by having the two aspects, the opportunity of face to face contact when somebody visits New York, and at the same time, keeping more intimate contact with people in different countries that we will not have met otherwise. That's possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012218&quot; id=&quot;012218&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:22:18):&lt;/a&gt; Well, I should let you two get to your dinner. Thank you for taking so much time to talk with me. These are always really fun.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012223&quot; id=&quot;012223&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:22:23):&lt;/a&gt; Thank you. We enjoy it very much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012225&quot; id=&quot;012225&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:22:25):&lt;/a&gt; Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I want to tell you about the place I spent summers growing up. It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chq.org/&quot;&gt;Chautauqua Institution&lt;/a&gt;, and it's one of the most special places in the world — and not just because I spent my childhood there. Chautauqua is special because it is an idea embedded in a place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; is a small town in western New York, on the edge of the Great Lakes. Chautauqua's human-scale streets are lined with lovingly-tended gardens and charming Victorian cottages. No one locks their bicycles, children romp without adult supervision, and neighbors wave from front porches.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/span&gt; embedded in this place is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chq.org/about-us/history&quot;&gt;Chautauqua movement&lt;/a&gt;, which began in 1874. It was an experiment in out-of-school learning, whose purpose was to provide an education and access to the arts to those who didn't have the opportunity attend college. 150 years later, the idea is still going strong. Chautauqua is a place of perpetual learning, one where everyone in the tight-knit community values learning new things and encourages each other to do so. &lt;div class=&quot;large-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/91f0e6b8-9e0a-4ab0-89c3-4adb52e7bab7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;143&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;The season&quot;: &lt;/span&gt;Each summer, the community gets together to run 9 weeks of programs offering a wide range of speakers, performances, lectures, concerts, classes, parades, art fairs, theater shows, children's camps, waterfront activities, and more. Chautauquans live for this 9-week period each year, which they call &quot;the Season&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These events are accessible to everyone in the community, which creates a shared context that shows up everywhere. When you order a cone at the ice cream shop, you overhear friendly strangers talking about the concert you saw last night. When you stop by the post office, the postman asks you what you thought of yesterday's Fourth of July parade. In an environment like this, it feels natural to start an interesting conversation with anyone on the street, because they're likely walking back from the same lecture that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; just attended, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These programs are enjoyable in their own right, but the real value is that they select for people who care about learning and improving their community. There's a real sense of shared values, and many of the programs are run by self-organizing clubs. Chautauqua is a place created by the ~8,000 people who live there every summer, and they've shaped the place to their values.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Chautauqua's special approach to public goods: &lt;/span&gt;This is all supported by the Chautauqua Institution, the organization that operates infrastructure for the community to use. They build and maintain lecture halls, an amphitheater, a cinema, and other buildings specifically designed for the Chautauqua community's purposes. The Institution provides a platform for community-run organization to host events on top of without having to make big capital investments.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, my grandma was the president of the Bird Tree &amp; Garden Club, and one memorable event they organized was to bring Jane Goodall to Chautauqua and talk about chimpanzees and preservationism. The Institution lent them a pavilion to host the event (rather than the club having to own a building of its own), but the club raised the funds to bring Jane to Chautauqua without the Institution's help. Chautauqua has a great mix of grassroots efforts that adapt to the community's interests as well as high-quality infrastructure at a bigger scale that only the Institution can provide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 239px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 239px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 239px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/66c912da-5bff-40d3-bd94-65eaaf5de91c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption center&quot;&gt;So many memories from sitting on the porch. 😊&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/7a1914c8-4822-4940-a380-41d9a32bdfb6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1136&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;How it grew: &lt;/span&gt;Chautauqua's history suggests a path for how to create more places like it. Chautauqua began as a summer school camp for teachers in 1874, and as they came back year after year, they invested in upgrading their canvas tents to little shacks and ultimately to full-fledged houses. Each step naturally flowed from the previous one. No one made any huge leap of faith. Each investment to make the place a little more livable met a real need of the community that was forming there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The lesson I take from Chautauqua is that you can solve the cold start problem by building a ladder of commitment that people can ascend one step at a time. Instead of offering to build full-fledged homes right out the gate when there’s nothing there yet, host an annual recurring summer camp that people adore. If they come back year after year, they will naturally start to think &quot;how can we make this more permanent?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 239px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 239px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 478px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/f29f9eed-9865-4f50-b924-feecd68fa651.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chautauqua began as a temporary 2-weeks-a-year tent camp. It has since evolved into a full-fledged town with comfortable cottages, colorful gardens, and robust infrastructure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 239px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/ef23b1fd-e11d-429e-a549-95718e9a5fd2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chautauqua provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://daily.jstor.org/the-forgotten-movement-that-changed-american-womens-lives/&quot;&gt;opportunities for women&lt;/a&gt; in a time when they had little access to education.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 239px; padding: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/4d9083b9-24ac-4a62-9546-24661a6afb88/8f229f80-afe5-4d9a-9d58-962615fa8234.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chautauqua is home to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/18/archives/new-jersey-pages-oldest-book-club-is-100-initially-a-reading-course.html&quot;&gt;oldest continuous book club&lt;/a&gt; in America, the Chautauqua Literary &amp; Scientific Circle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Chautauqua is so wonderful, but it's also confusing — why aren't there more places like this? Naturally, spending time here in Chautauqua prompts some questions:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;How could you adapt the Chautauqua format for different purposes and audiences?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;What would it take to create a successor of Chautauqua today?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;What places have you been that are like Chautauqua?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why does the programming at Chautauqua run for 9 weeks of the year? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;How would it change the dynamics if the season were longer or shorter? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;How does the rise of remote work and nomadic lifestyles change the the opportunities to build a Chautauqua today?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0012&quot; id=&quot;0012&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:12):&lt;/a&gt; Hello and welcome to the second episode of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Order Without Design&lt;/span&gt;. I'm Devon and, in this series, I get to talk about cities with the most interesting couple I know, Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud. The Bertauds have lived in diverse cities around the world, ranging from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to Bangkok, Thailand, and New York City to Oran, Algeria. They raised three children while living this nomadic lifestyle. For this episode, I was excited to dig into their role as parents, how it shaped their experience in cities, and what it was like to raise children in such an unconventional way. So with that, let's get started.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0052&quot; id=&quot;0052&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:52):&lt;/a&gt; I live in San Francisco, a city which famously has more dogs than children. Why do you think that is?&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/8f63ecc6-862d-48ca-a133-4a19c0b73c78/61d03ea1-33a7-4302-bf39-442aac370edd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;117&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0059&quot; id=&quot;0059&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:59):&lt;/a&gt; Well, I think it's a question of generation. Probably, many women now, educated women, want to have a career and they postpone having children. They consider that it's a bit incompatible. We believe it's compatible, but it's just a question of choice. And a dog, I believe, is a substitute for a child for some time or maybe forever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0124&quot; id=&quot;0124&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:24):&lt;/a&gt; I will add that, in a way, I think it's very much related to the type of comfort and consumption you expect. When we moved from Paris to New York with a small child, we didn't have an apartment in New York. We didn't know anything about the housing market in New York. We found quickly that we could afford only one room, a studio, basically. We felt it was okay. I think it would be completely unacceptable to most American families to be living with one child in a studio.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0156&quot; id=&quot;0156&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:56):&lt;/a&gt; I think also, if I remember well, that corresponds to the definition of a slum for UN Habitat. Three persons in a room, I think, is the limit. So it's a question of expectation. And to us, frankly, we never thought that living in Manhattan in a studio with a child was a hardship. We found it fun. We adapted to it. Sometimes, the child was crying when we wanted to study. There were times like that. This could happen, but we adapted to it. We could not afford a babysitter at the beginning until Marie-Agnes found some work. So when we went to parties or dinner, we would bring our child with us. We had a small stroller where we could bring the stroller in a bus or in the subway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0241&quot; id=&quot;0241&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (02:41):&lt;/a&gt; So it's a question of expectation, of what you expect in terms of comfort. I think that many American parents and mostly European now, Western European, think that if you have a child you need at least a two-bedroom apartment and, without that, it's impossible to have. It's, of course, not true. And again, having lived in a lot of countries with much lower income, we can see that people can survive very well in different conditions. So it's a question of expectation, of consumption, and a trade off between having a child and consuming more or less housing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0316&quot; id=&quot;0316&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (03:16):&lt;/a&gt; Right. You mentioned that most Americans would've found your living conditions unacceptable when you first moved to New York. What accounts for this difference?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0324&quot; id=&quot;0324&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (03:24):&lt;/a&gt; It's true. There's something about Americans have a love for space, where the Europeans have a love for amenities in a city, being close to amenities. I think Americans have a love for space. Maybe, I don't know, the myth of the frontier or something like that. There's something about space. And indeed, there is plenty of space in America compared to Europe, but for instance when we moved, we bought a condominium when we were in Washington, then when we came back from Haiti. So we had two children at the time. And we look at the market and we found an apartment which had one bedroom and then we bought that and we had two children at the time. So basically, we had each child in one bedroom and then we will have our bed in the living room, in fact.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0409&quot; id=&quot;0409&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (04:09):&lt;/a&gt; And the people in the condominium criticized that saying, &quot;Well, you are overusing the apartment.&quot; They were not worried about expense in water or things like that. They thought it was, I would say, even slightly immoral. They asked us, &quot;But they are two different sexes. Do they sleep in the same room?&quot; or something like that. I mean, there's something, may I dare to say, puritanical about that. So they thought it was ... And then they changed the condominium rule saying that people with two children could not live in the one-bedroom apartment. So there is something, again, what is expected, what is correct.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0447&quot; id=&quot;0447&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (04:47):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. Yeah. A sense of, &quot;It's just not right. They're just not supposed to live that way.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0451&quot; id=&quot;0451&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (04:51):&lt;/a&gt; That's right. And it was not either that we could not afford it. First, it was a choice. It gave us, by spending relatively little on an apartment, it gave us a lot of financial freedom. Whatever you spend on housing is not spent on other things or is not saved. It allowed us to save a lot of money, in a way and have a lot of financial freedom in terms of looking for a job. I think this was very, very precious to us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0521&quot; id=&quot;0521&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (05:21):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. My boyfriend and I have made the same choice. People are always shocked to hear that we live in a one-room apartment together, despite the fact that we could afford better, but yeah. We travel a fair bit. It doesn't really make sense to spend a lot of money on an apartment that you're going to only be in for two thirds of the year. And we like going out and spending time in cafes and stuff. So it works pretty well, but it's just a choice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0544&quot; id=&quot;0544&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (05:44):&lt;/a&gt; It's a choice, yeah. It's a choice and people should tolerate the same as we have to tolerate that some people like to have large gardens. That's fine, that's fine, but the problem is when you impose some of your values on someone else.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0557&quot; id=&quot;0557&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (05:57):&lt;/a&gt; When the condominium put those additional rules in place, how did you guys respond? What did you do?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0601&quot; id=&quot;0601&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (06:01):&lt;/a&gt; Oh, we didn't do anything because we were grandfathered. They even told us that it was not directed against us, but that they felt that it was not right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0612&quot; id=&quot;0612&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (06:12):&lt;/a&gt; It was to prevent others from doing that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0614&quot; id=&quot;0614&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (06:14):&lt;/a&gt; What other countries have similar norms to America in terms of this desire for space?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0618&quot; id=&quot;0618&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (06:18):&lt;/a&gt; Countries that have a lot of land, like Australia, New Zealand, or Canada, which have extremely large reserves of land, and probably they have a taste for larger apartments. If you look at the size of housing, internationally, Australia, New Zealand, and Canadian and American are the ones who are outliers in terms of consumption per person of floor space. But they're also a very wealthy nations, but there is no doubt that, if you live in France or, say, in Holland, your apartment will have to be a little smaller.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0651&quot; id=&quot;0651&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (06:51):&lt;/a&gt; My guess is that, because in America there's sort of almost always an option to just move a little farther out and there will be a place where the land is very cheap and you still have some access to metropolitan regions, whereas somewhere like the Netherlands is almost entirely built up. So it's not really even an option, except for in the most extreme cases.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0710&quot; id=&quot;0710&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (07:10):&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah. And so, you make a trade off here. It was, again, your social life and the use of amenities and space. For instance, where we live now, here in in New Jersey, we have very few amenities. We have some pretty good restaurants around, but that's about it. So it's kind of the access is limited compared to if we were living in the city. So it's a tradeoff we have made now in our old age to have very quiet night, to go to New York twice a week and enjoy the amenities, but in a certain way, it's a tradeoff we have made later in life, not when we had children. By the way, you know that, in France, I'm not completely sure if it's still true now, but people who have children live in the city, in Paris, for instance. They will live in the city, itself. And it's only when they retire that they go to the suburb because they feel that they are not going to go out to a theater or something when they are old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0805&quot; id=&quot;0805&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (08:05):&lt;/a&gt; There was even these kind of people making fun about suburbs being for retired people, in &quot;pavilion de banlieue&quot; with retired people who are just watering their flowers every morning because they have nothing else to do. So it's a complete opposite of Americans who usually, as soon as they have children, they tend to move to the suburbs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0825&quot; id=&quot;0825&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (08:25):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. Speaking to a lot of my friends who tend to really like cities and they love living in San Francisco or New York with places with lots of amenities. They'll say, &quot;Yes, I love the city, but when it's time to raise children, I, of course, will move out to the suburbs.&quot; So it's interesting to hear that change. Do you think that this is a function of difference of amenities in Paris, say, versus San Francisco? Is Paris a better place to raise children than San Francisco or New York?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0852&quot; id=&quot;0852&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (08:52):&lt;/a&gt; Well, it depends what you expect. We never had teenage children in Paris when we were living there. We had just a small baby, but our French friends had teenagers and were living in the center of Paris. We had a very good friend living in Le Marais. The advantage for them is that, as soon as they were 10, 12 years old, those children were completely independent. They will go to library, museum, movies, or meet some friends and take the subway. They had roller skates. I remember, also, they will go around the city in roller skates. They were 12 years old. This was considered to be normal. I think Americans would have been very, very uneasy about that. That's a bit difference of culture.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#0932&quot; id=&quot;0932&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (09:32):&lt;/a&gt; The idea in France that, as soon as your children are teenagers, you have to drive them around to their judo lesson or their music lesson or their practice of soccer, it's completely unknown. You don't do that. The children are supposed to be independent. When I was brought up in Marseilles, I would go to the Boy Scout, for instance. I would go on my own. I would walk half an hour to go to where they were and something like that and we would take the tramway to go to picnic or something. The parents were absolutely not being the taxi for the children. It never happened.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1009&quot; id=&quot;1009&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (10:09):&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yeah. And that means the children are more independent, but the parents are more independent, as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1014&quot; id=&quot;1014&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (10:14):&lt;/a&gt; Exactly, yes. I mean, of course, I've been brought up that way, so it's normal. I think, especially living in the suburbs now, I think the life of the parents, when the children are teenagers, is really ... I think it's terrible. I mean, probably they get some reward of watching their kids play soccer or tennis or whatever, but I don't know. I think they are too much the slave of their children and I don't think it's that good for the children either because they are entirely also dependent on their parents, but I don't know. Those are just different cultures.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1049&quot; id=&quot;1049&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (10:49):&lt;/a&gt; I imagine features of the city really depend on how safe and how comfortable and how practical it is for children to have flexibility to wander around. And you two have lived in a lot of different cities with children. How did your experience in places like Bangkok versus Port-au-Prince versus New York City vary in terms of you feeling comfortable letting your children wander around and have a lot of independence?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1114&quot; id=&quot;1114&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (11:14):&lt;/a&gt; And for entertaining, the children entertained themselves because they were surrounded in a safe place with other children about the same age. Even when we were in Thailand, our child Yann was, at that time 12, 14 years old. We would let him stay with Thai children on the beach. And for one week, he will be living in a Thai family, very poor family, but we knew that he was safe. We knew the family. We knew the children and it was a good advantage for our son to be independent for one week, like in a camp, but surrounded by nice people and he loves windsurfing and the people who are around him were windsurfers. So he started very quickly to be a very strong windsurfer guy in Thailand because the wind is perfect and the temperature of the water is perfect. So we can surf any time during the year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1216&quot; id=&quot;1216&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (12:16):&lt;/a&gt; Were your children free to wander around, independently, around Bangkok and go from place to place and take themselves to school?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1223&quot; id=&quot;1223&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (12:23):&lt;/a&gt; Sometimes, they would go in the street, but in the neighborhood streets and buy street food for us by themselves. In Bangkok, you have a lot of street food, people selling food in the street, but they did not go outside the neighborhoods. Certainly not, no.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1237&quot; id=&quot;1237&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (12:37):&lt;/a&gt; In which city did you feel like your children were most safe?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1240&quot; id=&quot;1240&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (12:40):&lt;/a&gt; Everywhere, yes. Even in El Salvador, at the time ... Now, El Salvador is very unsafe, but at the time, they were a little older. They were 10 and eight. They would go around the neighborhood by themselves, by the way. They had schoolmates, which were within, I would say, one thousand yards from our house and they would go by themselves and then come back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1301&quot; id=&quot;1301&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (13:01):&lt;/a&gt; They would go to the swimming pool of the hotel. It was about three blocks from our place, and they went by themselves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1309&quot; id=&quot;1309&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (13:09):&lt;/a&gt; And at the time, there was no telephone that we could use. I mean, the telephones were already in the house, but let's say, we were not exceptional. That was the normal thing to do. Their schoolmates in El Salvador, they were all Salvadorian, by the way. There were practically no foreigners in El Salvador in the school. And so the parents found that completely normal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1328&quot; id=&quot;1328&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (13:28):&lt;/a&gt; What was a time that they got in trouble?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1331&quot; id=&quot;1331&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (13:31):&lt;/a&gt; Yann was very independent and he was early working because he was windsurfing and he realized that we couldn't buy him, every six months, a new sail or a new board. So he worked, at the age of 16, he worked in a surf shop next door and he was getting all the material he could test and play with. And Veronique was more going to friend's place and I will drive, if I was available. If not, she will take the subway and go to the friend's place. But Marion was born later, when the children were eight and 10. She was maybe less mobile than the oldest one because the oldest had been brought up in so many countries. When Marion, born in El Salvador, when she was at the age of three, we moved to Thailand. And in Thailand, next to the office, we had a kindergarten where she went and she learned Thai, all the good manners. And she will be very polite and very respecting of adults, as the Thai children are. And we found that she was quite obedient and no problem when they get teenager.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1504&quot; id=&quot;1504&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (15:04):&lt;/a&gt; Were there any moments where you were anxious for their safety?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1508&quot; id=&quot;1508&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (15:08):&lt;/a&gt; I can remember only one time where we were really worried. We were traveling with a Volkswagen camper in Mexico and Yann, at the time, was three years old and Veronique was close to one. I think Yann was three years old. And so we were in a restaurant in the center of Guadalajara, in the center of the city, and we had parked the car about five or six blocks from there. All the waiters were very attentive to the children because it was two blonde children. They were taking them to the kitchen, giving them tortilla, whatever, fruits. And so we didn't pay too much attention to them. And then, when we left and paid our bill and we left, suddenly, our son was missing. Nobody knew where he was. We assumed he was in the kitchen, as he has been several times with the waiters. And then they told, &quot;No, we haven't seen him.&quot; And we found that he had left the restaurant by himself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1604&quot; id=&quot;1604&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (16:04):&lt;/a&gt; And suddenly, then, we really panicked because we were in the center of the city with rough traffic. And so Marie-Agnes went on one side, I went on the other asking, &quot;Did you see a blonde child, three years old, walking around by himself?&quot; And so, as it was a little uncommon at the time, Yann was very blonde. His hairs were nearly white. So people noticed him in Mexico and they said, &quot;Yes, he went this way.&quot; And eventually, we found him. He had walked five blocks. That means he crossed the street by himself several times and he was waiting for us next to the car. That was the only time where, really, we panicked about our children and we wished things were different.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1647&quot; id=&quot;1647&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (16:47):&lt;/a&gt; How long did it take for you to find him back at the car?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1650&quot; id=&quot;1650&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (16:50):&lt;/a&gt; Oh, maybe 20, 25 minutes because we were looking a bit everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1654&quot; id=&quot;1654&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (16:54):&lt;/a&gt; And we were ready to go to the police station.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1658&quot; id=&quot;1658&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (16:58):&lt;/a&gt; Police station. Yeah, yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1659&quot; id=&quot;1659&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (16:59):&lt;/a&gt; We thought maybe he has been kidnapped or something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1702&quot; id=&quot;1702&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (17:02):&lt;/a&gt; Again, at the time, Mexico was not as violent as it is now, but still, a three-year-old kid in the middle of the traffic, imagine downtown Guadalajara, the traffic is pretty, pretty... and it's not very disciplined. So you really panic about that, what can happen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1723&quot; id=&quot;1723&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (17:23):&lt;/a&gt; Did he explain why he'd decided to leave?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1725&quot; id=&quot;1725&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (17:25):&lt;/a&gt; He's very independent and he has always liked cars. And for him, the car was really the thing that he was interested in and he thought he was bored in the restaurant probably and he thought the car, if he could get ... but not get into the car, of course, because it was locked. Because we were moving for three months in this Volkswagen camper. So for him, that was his house and he liked it because he liked everything which is mechanical and technological. He likes cars.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1752&quot; id=&quot;1752&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (17:52):&lt;/a&gt; And still, he likes cars. And I think he's like Alain and I. He has a very good sense of orientation and very early, at the age of three, he remembered exactly where the car was and taking the initiative just to walk back to the car. At three years old, few children have this idea about direction.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1815&quot; id=&quot;1815&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (18:15):&lt;/a&gt; Right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1817&quot; id=&quot;1817&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (18:17):&lt;/a&gt; And the idea of leaving the restaurant where his parents were and just go by himself. Again, it shows a sense of independence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1825&quot; id=&quot;1825&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (18:25):&lt;/a&gt; You mentioned before that your youngest child studied, in Thailand, Thai manners and went to a Thai school?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1832&quot; id=&quot;1832&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (18:32):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. She was only two and a half years old when we moved to Thailand. And both we were working in this outfit, the Housing Authority in Thailand. It's a government business. Very, very large office. And the government company had a kindergarten just next to the office. So we would drop Marion to the kindergarten and, the first month, we get the report from the kindergarten all written in Thai and we couldn't read the report, so we asked a colleague of ours to make a translation weekly about what was in the report. So she starts to do the translation verbally and then stop. Then I saw that there were two pages and she stopped after some time. And I said, &quot;What about the other page?&quot; And she said, &quot;Well, I'm very embarrassed.&quot; I said, &quot;No, no, just tell us.&quot; And the other page was saying that Marion has a tendency at the time of the break to go quickly to the swing and mobilize the swing for herself and not to let the other children use the swing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1943&quot; id=&quot;1943&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (19:43):&lt;/a&gt; And that was not a good manner for the Thai. You have to share. You have to let the others take the swing. And so she would push the other children and go to the swing immediately. They were also complaining about her not respecting carefully the rules. And the rules were, at the beginning, she didn't know the rules, the rules were to bow to the teacher, take your shoes off when you enter the classroom and put the shoes all well aligned and she would not do that. So she learned very quickly. After the second month, the report was very positive and very nice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2024&quot; id=&quot;2024&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (20:24):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. And especially, what was amazing was that, after, when she would come home, she would keep those manners. For instance, the way she would curtsy to us before asking something or, in the morning, she will have exactly mimicked the Thai way, which is extremely respectful with adults, always having graceful gestures. Also, every gesture to take something or to receive something is rehearsed, a bit like a ballet, in a way. You have certain gestures. You have to put your finger in a certain way and not another. If not, it's impolite. Never show the back of your feet, for instance. There are a lot of rules like that, which are extremely intricate, but that the children learn very early. And I suppose it's not a burden for them because it's become a reflex.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2108&quot; id=&quot;2108&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (21:08):&lt;/a&gt; But as soon as she left the school, after, when she came back, she became a normal American child again. She would not curtsy to us in the morning or something like that. When we were in Yemen, Yann, our son, he was already three to five and he started learning school, but our neighbors, we had a neighbor who was the CIA station chief and his wife was a schoolteacher and she was British. And he has two daughters who were about the age of my son. The wife of this guy would take Yann and there was a school of, let's say, three children. And he learned English that way, the first time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2147&quot; id=&quot;2147&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (21:47):&lt;/a&gt; But for Veronique, she was younger, so it was a little more difficult. The last year we were there, when Veronique was four years old, then we wanted her to meet some kids her age. So the only solution was to put her, in fact, in a koranic school. Normally, girls in Yemen will not go to school, except koranic school. So we put her there in this koranic school. So she learned Arabic that way and also, unfortunately, she copied the manners of the kids. And one of the things Yemeni children did at the time, like their adults, was spitting all the time. So you have this little blonde girl, three years old, suddenly racking her throat and spitting. That was just opposite of the Thai manners. So we had to explain here saying, &quot;Well, no, you should not spit all the time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2243&quot; id=&quot;2243&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (22:43):&lt;/a&gt; Has she kept any of those habits? Not necessarily the spitting, but anything else, if you were to meet her as an adult today? She behaves differently than an American or a French girl would?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2253&quot; id=&quot;2253&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (22:53):&lt;/a&gt; I think children try to imitate their environment and mostly the environment of their peer, to do what their peers do. So as soon as she comes to America, she wants to be an American kid. Yann, for instance, my son, when he was a teenager, always had a baseball cap and he would absolutely refuse to even taste wine or things like that. He wanted to look American. When he was 18, he would start drinking beer out of his six pack and absolutely not touching wine or anything like that because he thought it was un-American. And by the way, when he went to California, then people say, &quot;Oh, you are French. You must know about wine,&quot; and then he finds people who were knowledgeable about wine and, suddenly, he realizes that he has to learn about wine, too, just, I guess, to mix with the Californians. It was different from Maryland, so he abandoned his six pack there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2343&quot; id=&quot;2343&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (23:43):&lt;/a&gt; They're very shaped by their environment, it sounds like.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2345&quot; id=&quot;2345&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (23:45):&lt;/a&gt; And their peers. When we came back to the States, they were a little ashamed of our accents. They were embarrassed by our accent. For instance, if we would go to a restaurant, even a fast food or something when they were 15 or something, they would say, &quot;Let us order because the waiter will not understand you because of your accent.&quot; And they were embarrassed that, in front of other people, they would be with those adults who do not speak English with an American accent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2413&quot; id=&quot;2413&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (24:13):&lt;/a&gt; Do your children have an American accent?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2415&quot; id=&quot;2415&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (24:15):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. I mean, they are better at English than French, but their French is completely fluent, but sometimes it's a domestic language, although they study French at school. But let's say, they are much more fluent in English. Actually, if we discuss politics or something a little difficult, we will switch to English with them because it's easier for them, but not for day-to-day conversation. Then we'll stick to French.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2759&quot; id=&quot;2759&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (27:59):&lt;/a&gt; What factors do transportation planners need to take into account to serve children and families?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2805&quot; id=&quot;2805&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (28:05):&lt;/a&gt; Well, certainly, the safety of transport is very important. So the design of subway stations or bus stations are important, but it's really the attitude of the public, in general, toward the child, whether they will be protected. The design has to do something. Again, the design of a bus stop or a subway station is important, too, so that it will be safe for children including, by the way, in Asian subway stations, usually the subway platform is completely protected when the train is not here. There are doors which open only when the train is here. So again, a child cannot be pushed or fall on the track. So that's already, for instance, a feature which I encourage children for taking the subway and being safe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2854&quot; id=&quot;2854&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (28:54):&lt;/a&gt; But say, you could see in Paris ... I suppose it's still true now, but when we were living in Paris, kids of eight or nine taking the subway by themselves and, at the time, the platform was not protected and they knew about it. And I assume also there that the passengers who were waiting, if they see a kid alone, will make sure that the kid doesn't go too close from the edge of the platform.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2918&quot; id=&quot;2918&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (29:18):&lt;/a&gt; If I told you we had to put your three children in a city to live alone while they were growing up, just for, let's say, a month, the three of them were to move there together with no parents, no grandparents around, what city do you think that they would be safest in and that they would be able to get around the most easily?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2934&quot; id=&quot;2934&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (29:34):&lt;/a&gt; Thailand may be the best because people in Thailand are very, very protective of the children. They respect and the people are very concerned and all the time ready to help you. And if we were to leave them alone, I would not have have to ask in the neighborhood or the person who was working for us, she was not sleeping in our house. She was just coming for the day, but she would have agreed, for sure, to take the children and I would have even been accommodating her children if she was to sleep in our house so they could have an adult. This woman was very, very beautiful concerning cleanness and education. She would be very careful that they never get in trouble.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3028&quot; id=&quot;3028&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (30:28):&lt;/a&gt; And very polite. The Thai are extremely polite at every level of society. There is not a politeness which is kind of upper class and then middle class and then, let's say, poorer class, they all have the same standards of politeness so that it makes relationships between social classes very, very easy. Compare it to India, for instance, where the level of politeness is not the same, depending on the social class. The people of upper class have often a contempt for the lower class and they show it in their manners. They are impolite, literally, with the people who work for them. So that's, again, a difficult thing to accept when you live there. But in Thailand, what we absolutely loved was these very elaborate manners were exactly the same at every level of society.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3116&quot; id=&quot;3116&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (31:16):&lt;/a&gt; By the way, I found that in Southeast Asia, in general, I found the same thing in Indonesia or Vietnam, but especially Indonesia that people are extremely polite with each other. It doesn't mean that they cannot be exploitative or something like that. Yes, they could be, but at least they don't humiliate people who are in the lower, let's say, grade of society. That, I think, is very, very positive. In India, sometimes you see people humiliating other people because they can do it. And it's extremely, I think, disheartening. So that's, again, those culture differences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3153&quot; id=&quot;3153&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (31:53):&lt;/a&gt; Why do you think there are those cultural differences? Why do you see that behavior in some places, but not necessarily in others?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3200&quot; id=&quot;3200&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (32:00):&lt;/a&gt; Because in a way, say, if you compare India and Thailand, well, Thailand is a Buddhist country. It's not Hindu, but the culture in Thailand is very, in many ways, came from India. The characters they use to write Thai are, in fact, derived from Sanskrit, or their folklore ideas they use Ramayana all the time in their stories and things like that. So it's all coming from India, except that they do not have caste. And in India, the caste system was really the structure of society and it's still there now. What's interesting in India that, when they became independent, they banned caste, but at the same time, they established very quickly a system of affirmative action for castes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3409&quot; id=&quot;3409&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (34:09):&lt;/a&gt; Why is it less strong in the cities?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3411&quot; id=&quot;3411&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (34:11):&lt;/a&gt; Because I think that some people of lower caste has made it well. And so wealth attenuates this a bit, but not completely. Also, if you are trading, if you have a restaurant and half of your clients are lower caste, probably you have to treat them equally if you want to keep their patronage. So I think that it attenuates, but it's much more extreme in villages. In villages, still now in India, the lower castes often have no access to the water faucets, to the wells that the others castes use. There are certain restaurants where they cannot even go to eat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3451&quot; id=&quot;3451&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (34:51):&lt;/a&gt; Wow. I guess, in the city, there's more opportunity for people to be mobile and interact with different types of people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3727&quot; id=&quot;3727&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (37:27):&lt;/a&gt; It's a very clever way to generally do well in your career, is to find things that you don't mind doing as much as some other people mind doing, and make that your strength and just go for it. And you can become really good at it because you have less competition.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3741&quot; id=&quot;3741&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (37:41):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. That's interesting you say that, yes. One day, I got a fantastic job with the UN after I left Haiti. I was working for a consulting firm in Washington before we went to El Salvador and I was asked to go to Bhutan. That was in '75. And with Marie-Agnes for a month, to look at building materials in Bhutan, whether those building materials could be used for modern housing. So it was a perfect assignment. Imagine going around Bhutan for one month, looking at building temples, people were like ... So it was perfect.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3816&quot; id=&quot;3816&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (38:16):&lt;/a&gt; So when I came back and I had a debriefing in New York at the UN about my mission in Bhutan. And I told them, &quot;Gee, I really like this assignment. This is wonderful. I'm glad you remembered I was an architect and have a very strong interest in local building material.&quot; And they told me, &quot;Ah, yes, that's right, but we didn't select you because of that, frankly. We looked at our roster of consultants and we thought, 'What consultant will accept to go to a country which has no hotels?' And everybody said, 'Bertaud would do that,'&quot; because of my stay in Yemen. I never complained in Yemen about living conditions. And they knew I was ... In Yemen, I would go to small village some time, towns were there were no hotels, obviously, and things like that and I never complained.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3904&quot; id=&quot;3904&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (39:04):&lt;/a&gt; So in a way, I had this reputation of being ready to do things that others will not do and it gave me a comparative advantage, but for me, it was fun.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3913&quot; id=&quot;3913&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (39:13):&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3915&quot; id=&quot;3915&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (39:15):&lt;/a&gt; And of course, the stay in Bhutan was fantastically comfortable because, in fact, the Bhutanese have a system in the monastery which are, in fact, the monasteries are also part of the administrative structure. So they have a guesthouse for the civil servants who travels through Bhutan because there aren't hotels. So they stay in the monasteries in special rooms for guests and they are extremely well-treated. The food is excellent and things like that. So it's not a hotel in the traditional way, but it's very comfortable and extremely beautiful. You have a room which is painted with frescoes, which have been done in the maybe 15th century or something like that. What can you ask more?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3955&quot; id=&quot;3955&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (39:55):&lt;/a&gt; That sounds even better than a hotel and more interesting, to boot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3958&quot; id=&quot;3958&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (39:58):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, yeah. It was certainly better and you are right on the spot and you can attend the religious service, too. Any time when you hear some music, you go there and it was a fantastic thing. But for them, they thought most people will not go because there were no hotels. There was no modern hotels.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4017&quot; id=&quot;4017&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (40:17):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. I work for GitHub, which is a software company, and a big part of my job as a product manager here is talking to a lot of developers and a lot of software engineers and programmers and going all around the world and traveling and also doing some press and, basically, having a lot of conversations with interesting people all over the world. And this is great. This is exactly what I want to be doing and I love doing that, but I recently had a conversation with someone on my team who was like, &quot;Oh, thank goodness you do that. I can't believe you put up with it, but thank you for taking one for the team.&quot; And I realized that some people just don't want to do that. Some people don't want to go travel all the time, be in a different bed every week, and some people are more introverted. So it's really great to be able to find something that's a comparative advantage for you where not only are you willing to put up with it, but you are excited to do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4104&quot; id=&quot;4104&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (41:04):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. That's right. Absolutely, absolutely. Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4107&quot; id=&quot;4107&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (41:07):&lt;/a&gt; And in Bhutan, I had the chance to cook for ... We were stuck in a very mountainous place. Then there was a huge storm and the road was washed out and we couldn't pass. The car was stuck there and there was a little kind of tea shop that was serving tea and some little things. And they had a farm on this place and the lady was there with just some eggs. And I said, &quot;Can I do an omelet with the eggs?&quot; But she didn't understand what I was asking, but she let me use the eggs and the grease and we had an omelet with all the people who were there and we were very happy to be warm and nice. And then the schoolteacher was there, in this place, and after all, there were no hotels. And the schoolteacher, &quot;Okay, maybe the road will not be reestablished before tomorrow. Maybe you would like to come in the school and sleep there.&quot; So we slept on the floor in a school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4213&quot; id=&quot;4213&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (42:13):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. That was really wonderful. That was one of the best trips we had, actually.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4217&quot; id=&quot;4217&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (42:17):&lt;/a&gt; That sounds like a great adventure. Yeah. You understand the place from a much better perspective. I mean, I could imagine staying in a hotel could actually really hinder your understanding of a city because the people who live there don't live in hotels. And so you end up actually missing a lot of the perspective of what it's actually like to live there. So if you're trying to provide advice for how to improve the city as far as residents, it really makes more sense to live in a context ... or in the schoolhouse where the children go and so that you can see it from that view.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4246&quot; id=&quot;4246&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (42:46):&lt;/a&gt; Yes. That's a difficult thing sometimes. It's true. The hotel is a little haven of efficiency and tends to lose contact with reality... I remember, in Dhaka ... for instance, in Bangladesh, we were going to this place... it was a hotel run by Japanese. It was absolutely superb and, as soon as you enter, everything works well, everything is perfect, but you tend to forget then the difficulties of other people who are living in the rest of the city. It's a tiny little part of the city. And it's true, this is a problem. So that's why sometimes you are obliged to stay there in a big city because of communication. You have to work late at night, so the electricity should be in and things like that, but you have to escape. For instance, take your meals outside the hotel as much as possible. At least go to a local restaurant or something and walk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4341&quot; id=&quot;4341&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (43:41):&lt;/a&gt; For me, in my job, our job is to walk around the city everywhere, all the time. You don't spend your time at the hotel, except when you have to sleep or write your report or something like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4352&quot; id=&quot;4352&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (43:52):&lt;/a&gt; Right. So both of you worked during very much of the time that you had children, you were raising your children, but it sounds like you both had a lot of freedom and ability to get your jobs done and you brought them around with you instead of just sort of following their schedule. By contrast, I feel like, here in America, I see that a lot of parents will put their children's schedule first. They'll pack that schedule, but because the children can't get around, the parents, usually the mother, ends up driving them from place to place. And their life kind of gets taken over by children. And so this question is sort of self-motivated because I personally would like to have children one day, but I also love the work that I do. And honestly, I don't just want to be sitting in piano lessons all the time. What advice would you have for me and for other people who would potentially want to be parents and try to live more of a life of freedom and flexibility with their children and not having it quite so much taken over by the lifestyle?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4451&quot; id=&quot;4451&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (44:51):&lt;/a&gt; I believe, if you have enough money to keep your job and raise a family, you have to have some help. And we've been lucky because going to developing countries, getting someone to live with you or be coming to help you during the time you are in the office is a very, very necessity because if you are all the time obliged to do all the parents that ... I see my daughter. She has a professional life, but at the beginning, that was a problem with her husband. He has been raised with a mother who was a teacher, the husband and the father was a postman, and they had a very comfortable life. And the children, because she was a teacher, so she has the same time, when the children were on vacation, she was on vacation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4549&quot; id=&quot;4549&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (45:49):&lt;/a&gt; When you have a very demanding job like you or us, you cannot be all the time driving the children to the sport or to the piano lesson. And we make the choice, really, at the beginning. I was working in New York and then I was also working at the city planning commission. And my salary ... I have a babysitter. I would drop my children at her home, and my salary was split between me and her. And I knew that my son would be well taken care of because this woman had a child. And on my way to the subway, I would drop the child and taking the child back home when I was done with my work. And it was a perfect arrangement. And we have beautiful moment with this woman and her husband. We were very close friends after all and we would do picnic on the weekend together with the children and doing all sort of activity when we were not at work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4658&quot; id=&quot;4658&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (46:58):&lt;/a&gt; When we were in New York and Marie-Agnes started working, she didn't have a very high salary. Nor did I, by the way, but she was ready to spend half of her salary on babysitting for our child, at the time. And it was worth it, in a way. A kind of priority, in a way. Again, living in a very small apartment, in one-room apartment, but having a babysitter every day that you pay well. It's just a tradeoff and I think it's worth it. I mean, for Marie-Agnes, it was certainly worth it and for me, too, in a way, to have a wife who is also in the world professionally. We were not in the same department, not working in the same department, but it was interesting, at the end of the day, to discuss about things we have done other than if she has been confined to just taking care of the child and doing some shopping and things like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4752&quot; id=&quot;4752&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (47:52):&lt;/a&gt; It's good for the children, by the way, too, with other adults with authority which are different from their parents. I think that's very good also. It's a good habit, that they aren't necessarily always only with their parents.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4806&quot; id=&quot;4806&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (48:06):&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. What you were saying about both you and Marie-Agnes having work experience that you can come home and share is definitely an experience that I've had with Sebastian, where I feel like it's an experience I've had with my boyfriend, which is he has made me much better at my job because he has very interesting thoughts from the work he does, which is sort of tangential. He works also as a software engineer. And at least, in theory, I think I've helped him with his work, as well, just by being able to share that. I also really liked your phrasing, Marie-Agnes, that you split the salary with the babysitter. I think most people phrase it as, &quot;We paid the babysitter,&quot; as sort of a separate thing, but it's cool for you to be framing that way because it shows how the woman who took care of your children enabled you to then go out and have more flexibility. And so she's really enabling you to go do what you want as opposed to it just being sort of a service that you're paying for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4857&quot; id=&quot;4857&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (48:57):&lt;/a&gt; A friend of mine recently brought his three year old to visit her grandfather in Chicago for the first time. And when they came back, he said, &quot;Every time we bring her to a new place, it feels like she makes a step function in cognitive development.&quot; Your children traveled at a young age much more than, really, any other children that I know. I'm curious, how did this affect their development, relative to their peers? Is there anything that they understood at a younger age than most other children because they'd lived in all of these different countries?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4925&quot; id=&quot;4925&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (49:25):&lt;/a&gt; They understand the poverty of place. When we were in India, for example, they saw that some people were very poor... Even the rich, the children were invited to go to the swimming pool and the swimming pool was not what they were expecting. The children saw the swimming pool as we can see in France or the US and the swimming pool was just a basin with green algae floating and they didn't dare to put their feet in the water because they saw that it was not a swimming pool. But they see the difference between the way people live and the way we were living. Even so, we were working in this place, we all the time be in a comfortable apartment or houses with a lot of facility, but they could see the other children, very poor children, were asking for food or begging.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5024&quot; id=&quot;5024&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (50:24):&lt;/a&gt; And I remember, when we were in Mumbai and we were in the Taj Mahal Hotel, and we went out visit, just out in the street. And Veronique was only 10 years old and she was scared to see the children at the gate of the hotel without arms or legs and begging. She was horrified by seeing a child be without an arm or without a leg and that was maybe shocking for her, but certainly, it gave them the feeling that we were rich and the poor people were ... But Veronique, when we were living in Washington, DC, she went to the French school. And for lunchtime, normally the parents will give a lunchbox for lunch. And Veronique had her lunchbox going to the French school, but in the French school, you had the children from embassies, from African Embassy, particularly, where at lunchtime, the driver of the embassy will bring for the children a warm lunch because the driver was supposed to care also for the children.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5143&quot; id=&quot;5143&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (51:43):&lt;/a&gt; And Veronique asked us, &quot;Are we poor?&quot; And we said, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; And she said, &quot;But we don't have a driver to bring me the lunch at school.&quot; She was about 12 years old, 10 or 12 years old, when she asked this question. That surprised us, thinking that because we didn't have a driver, we were poor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5209&quot; id=&quot;5209&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (52:09):&lt;/a&gt; That shows that, in fact, they had forgotten the lesson that they had seen when they were younger. When we were in Yemen or even in Thailand or even in El Salvador, they saw very poor people and they were struck by it. They talked about how privileged we were. But as soon as we were in Washington, again, it was their peers they compared with, not with what they have learned before. And so they thought that, compared to their peers, they were poor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5238&quot; id=&quot;5238&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (52:38):&lt;/a&gt; What a breadth of experience, seeing everything from children begging on the street to children getting a hot lunch from their driver. You end up getting a much broader cross section of life than if you end up living in just one place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5251&quot; id=&quot;5251&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (52:51):&lt;/a&gt; Yes, yes. Exactly. Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5254&quot; id=&quot;5254&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (52:54):&lt;/a&gt; Well, this was a really fun conversation. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thank you very much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5259&quot; id=&quot;5259&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (52:59):&lt;/a&gt; Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup id='footnote-label--1' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1em; color: #006699&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. &lt;span style=&quot;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. &lt;/span&gt;From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;You&lt;/span&gt; can break the coordination trap! &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup id='footnote-label--2' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1em; color: #006699&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;more effective&lt;/span&gt;. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bringing it into a private space&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup id='footnote-label--3' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1em; color: #006699&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;Thanks to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;Sebastián&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt; Bensusan and John Backus for reading and providing feedback on drafts of this essay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; vertical-align: super;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(54, 124, 162); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The technical term for these silent onlookers is &quot;lurkers&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(54, 124, 162); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;EDIT 7/4/2020:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt; My friend Zooko &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1279492581655588864&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt; this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;Imagine a &quot;ಠ_ಠ&quot; button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(54, 124, 162); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--1').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $(&quot;#footnote-content--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-label--1').offset().top}, 200);}); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--2&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--2').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--3&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--3').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/owd-0-welcome-to-order-without-design&quot;&gt;my recent post&lt;/a&gt;, I'm starting a podcast with my friends, Marie-Agnes and Alain Bertaud, who also happen to be the most interesting couple I know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Over the course of this first conversation, we traveled all around the globe for a whirlwind tour of the adventurous life they've led together. Here are just a few spots that were on our itinerary:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;We started in &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Tunisia&lt;/span&gt; to hear about Marie-Agnes' childhood, then hopped over to neighboring &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Algeria&lt;/span&gt;, where Marie-Agnes and Alain first met. This is also when Alain was first drafted to work as an urban planner in the midst of Algeria's independence from France.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then, we made our way to the US, visiting &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; to hear about how Alain and Marie-Agnes started a family when they were penniless but optimistic immigrants to America.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our next stop was &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/span&gt;, where Alain and Marie-Agnes worked for three years as urban planners and befriended Yemeni artisans, tribespeople, and farmers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then we picked up speed, zipping around the globe to learn about their experiences working in &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Bangkok&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;San Salvador&lt;/span&gt;, and beyond and how their identity as foreigners played a role in what they were able to achieve.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The conversation then moved on to the topic of &quot;city deflation&quot;, and how declining populations are a new challenge for cities this century. We made stops in &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;France&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/span&gt;, and we visited cities in &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/span&gt; that lost so much population after the Soviet Union fell that they were formally closed. Then we went to &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Detroit&lt;/span&gt;, where we discussed why the water was turned off and how it's a more nuanced story than is normally told when looked at through the lens of &quot;city deflation&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It was a fabulous conversation, and we're so excited to get to share it with you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel&quot;&gt;Let us know what you think!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000000&quot; id=&quot;000000&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:00:00)&lt;/a&gt;There are certain things in every city which will surprise you. Why do you have a barbershop at this corner and why would you have no department store in this city? So you ask this question and you try to understand why it is like that. [music 00:00:24]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000024&quot; id=&quot;000024&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:00:24)&lt;/a&gt;Welcome to the Order Without Design podcast. I'm Devon, and my co-hosts are the most interesting couple I know: Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud. Alain is an urban planner and economist and Marie-Agnes is a pioneer in mapping and geospatial methods. This project is an extension of their book, Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With its focus on economic theory, you might not realize that this fantastic book is the product of the adventurous life these two have shared together. They have the most incredible stories from living their nomadic lifestyle. This podcast series is my excuse to hear and share those stories.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This first episode is an introduction to the Bertauds. Later episodes will focus on a particular dimension of their life, such as work, education, mobility or parenting and how those facets of their life have been shaped by the cities they've called home.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The three of us don't really have a grand vision for what this podcast will become. Much like the adventures they've had together, we're not really sure where we'll end up, but I can guarantee it'll be interesting if the Bertauds are involved. We had fun putting together this first episode and we can't wait to hear what you think. You can find a link to the transcript and photos in the description.&lt;div class=&quot;medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e50e2c88-1565-4ad5-a0cc-ad50603ce27e/885db074-a233-4847-8528-167ad0121442.jpg&quot; width=&quot;254&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So with that let's get started. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thank you for agreeing to do this with me. I'm super excited about this project. Today we're going to focus on your shared work as urbanists and how that's shaped your life and perspective.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So the first question is what was the path that brought you to the adventurous nomadic life that you two have led? I know Marie-Agnes you were born in Tunisia, so perhaps that's a good place to start.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000204&quot; id=&quot;000204&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:02:04)&lt;/a&gt; Yes, I was born up out of the financial hole if you can say, because early in my life, I live in Tunisia with French parents in the time where Tunisia was still under the protectorate or the French government and when the Tunisia get kind of independence my father was sent to Algeria at the war started almost as soon as we were there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000240&quot; id=&quot;000240&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:02:40)&lt;/a&gt; I know you mentioned that you met Alain when you were in Algeria. How did you guys meet and what were you doing at the time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000248&quot; id=&quot;000248&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:02:48)&lt;/a&gt; I was a teacher, and Alain was a kind of Peace Corps volunteer and instead of doing military service. He was sent to Algeria to become an urban planner and he was in charge of a small city in new West of Algeria called Clemson. When before I met Alain I was teaching in Tunisia also and when I saw the Tunisian getting, having problem with the French government, we know that one one day we'll be leaving the country. So we went as with my parents, I went to Algeria and when Algeria started to also rebel against the French, my sister and I both were teacher and we were planning to go to a special kind of teaching abode and we were almost ready to go to Africa where still the French government have a running school in Mauritania, in the Senegal. So we were almost ready to move.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000408&quot; id=&quot;000408&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:04:08)&lt;/a&gt; And then I met Alain and that changed my life. At the time I met her Alain, Alain teach me about dwellings and he was an architect or headed to be an architect and I started to be interested in architecture and I move in the same direction and Alain, going during a certain month drawing houses in Algeria and from there I take the opportunity to learn more about mapping and about GIS, geographic information system, to do all the work I've done for Alain book, analyzing land use, analyzing land density in cities and making data available for Alain to process and do this book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000507&quot; id=&quot;000507&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:05:07)&lt;/a&gt; Wow, what an incredible experience. So Alain, Marie-Agnes said that you really changed her life when she ended up meeting you in Algeria and I know you are originally from Marseille in France. So can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up in Algeria and what your path was through school and what you were envisioning the work you would be doing in your career when you were young?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000532&quot; id=&quot;000532&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:05:32)&lt;/a&gt; Very early I wanted to be an architect, probably at the age of 12 or 13 or something like that. And my father would, had a business, engineering business and he would have wished me to be an engineer, but he realized very quickly that I was very independent and things like that and I must say he didn't contradict my advocation if I get good at that. So I am very grateful for that because at the time, this is a long time ago, it was in the fifties. It was normal for parents to impose a profession on their, especially on their son. So I'm very grateful for my parents to be very liberal on that. So after that I finished my degree in Marseilles and then I moved to [Grenoble 00:06:26] to study architecture, but at the time there was only one school of architecture in France.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000632&quot; id=&quot;000632&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:06:32)&lt;/a&gt; It was in Paris and the decentralization system, the French way was that you could study in any town you wanted, but every month and a half you had to go to Paris to pass your exam because there was only one school and there was one entrance exam for entire France, which was in Paris. So it was a strange situation. I went to Grenoble because at the time I was doing competition skiing. I was a downhill icer and so for me when you are 19, 20 sports is very important for a boy. And so I thought so I will study architecture in Grenoble and then with my colleagues every month and a half we will go to Paris and spend a week in Paris passing our exams. Then we'll go back to Grenoble. Eventually after two or three years, maybe when you get smarter as a boy, you lose interest in competition.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000728&quot; id=&quot;000728&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:07:28)&lt;/a&gt; You realize that it takes too much of your time. So then I moved to Paris to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and then that's where I reached 25 and that's a time there was a draft in France. So you could postpone your, you could have a deferment when you were a student, but at a certain point when you were 25 usually you had to do your military service. So I was drafted in the army. I did six months of bootcamps and things like that, but I had applied also it was a new program. Algeria had been just recently independent two years before and the French were eager to maintain good relation with Algeria in spite of the very bitter and nasty fight to place for independence and so they started the equivalent of the Peace Corps.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000823&quot; id=&quot;000823&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:08:23)&lt;/a&gt; But for people will be in, instead of finishing their military service in a barrack in France, the one who I had degree in could go to usually Algeria at the time. It was only Algeria to be the equivalent of a Peace Corps. So after six months, certainly I receive my new papers saying that I will be an urban planner in Oean first, the city of Oran. So I went there, spent a few months there to familiarize myself with a job with Algeria, supervised by older Frenchmen who were still there after independence. They're this special kind of a assistant thing and then after that, then I was nominated to be on my own as an urban planner in the city of Clemson, but I met Marie-Agnes in Oran and it's also changed my life because at the time I was interested in many, many things and maybe I was not clearly focusing on a career or I was very much interested in archeology, in artistry, in mathematics also at the same time and I liked very much to challenge my professors, which is not a good way of getting very grade sometime.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#000956&quot; id=&quot;000956&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:09:56)&lt;/a&gt; And then when I met Marie-Agnes suddenly I realized that I have to concentrate on something and that something was in fact urban planning because although my training... At the time by the way at the École des Beaux-Arts they didn't make any difference between urban planning and architecture. For them a city was just a big building, which is of course a terrible mistake. A city is absolutely not a big building. So that means that it should be planning all details in advance and then after that you implement your plan. But my stay, I was always interested in cities because when before going to Algeria before when I was still a student, I will spend most of my summer very often in the Middle East, first in Europe and then in the middle East, looking at because of my interest in art history, looking at ruins usually and the Middle East is full of them, layers of civilization. So I will spend my summer there and because I was traveling in very, let's say I was not going to stand out hotels or similar to that. The type of hotel I would go to where hotels where you are 10 people per room and you don't know your roommates. That's the type of hotels in the Middle East I was staying in. So I get an interest, I was always living in the poor, the poorest quarter of say Istanbul or Ankara or Tehran or Shiraz or Isfahan and so I was interested in the city themselves because I realized that this poor neighborhood that they had a life of their own, which was very different from what I knew and that people knew how to organize themselves with very, very little resources.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001154&quot; id=&quot;001154&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:11:54)&lt;/a&gt; So that was I developed an interest in urban planning at that time or the year I spent in Algeria on the job, in the frontline, not studying, not reading books, not reading article, not making project for the bazaar, but a real problem. Like I explained in the book, receiving building permits every morning, having to take a decision whether to give the permit or not. These were really frontline decision and I found that very interesting. And that's Marie-Agnes is a very practical woman as you have guessed. She encouraged me in this direction. So that decided a bit my career.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001239&quot; id=&quot;001239&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:12:39)&lt;/a&gt; Your practical bottom of approach to understanding cities is really what stood out to me about your book. So it's cool to hear about sort of the turning point when that happened. When you mentioned that the École des Beaux-Arts had this approach that for them a city was just a big building where there's just more details to get right, but at the end of the day you can sort of design the whole thing and you ended up having a very different experience on the ground when you actually were working on real problems in Algeria. What were some of the things that you needed to learn and how did you change your mind over that process?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001313&quot; id=&quot;001313&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:13:13)&lt;/a&gt; Well, the approach of the École des Beaux-Arts is that an architect or a planner is a genius. So everything is in his head and he has to impose his ideas on others. This is the essence of it that in a way the public is uneducated and this job is to educate them and impose these ideas. By living in those cities, by being confronted very early and by the way, before going to Algeria, I have spent nine months in India and working in Chandigarh in the city built by Corbusier after India independence. So that was three years before I did my military service and here I learn also the difference between the theory about a city that you read in books or in papers and what it is to live in a city, go to work every morning, meet your friends and things like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pull-quote medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&quot;Cities have a physiology which is just like human beings. We have different culture, we have different history, we have a different environment.&quot; — Alain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001413&quot; id=&quot;001413&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:14:13)&lt;/a&gt; And then I sought, here I realized that there was a very, very big difference and if you want to be useful in a city, the first thing is to look around and look what people are doing and try to understand why they do it that way and then you can later say, &quot;Well maybe there's a better way of doing it,&quot; but first you have to understand why they do it that way and very often you find that they have a very good reason of doing things that way, including by the way things like informal settlement or something like that and former settlement or it's a very clever response of very poor people to situation. It is not something which necessarily have to be eradicated or something like that. So that's what I learned really that way. That's very, very different.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001505&quot; id=&quot;001505&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:15:05)&lt;/a&gt; And so the big difference also that an architect but especially an urban planner is certainly not a genius and should not be a genius. It should be more like a family doctor, somebody who will really look it very carefully about these patient. Cities have a lot of things in common, whether it's a city in a poor country or in a rich country, they have a physiology which is the same really like human being. We have the same physiology. However, like human beings, we have different culture, we have different history, we have a different environment which shaped us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001542&quot; id=&quot;001542&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:15:42)&lt;/a&gt; And so we have to take into account that. So let's say if I have to use a metaphor for an urban planner, the closest one would be a family doctor. Somebody would try to learn about his patient, their history, what is special to this patient, but at the same time relies on knowledge about the physiology, which is the same for every human being and the same for every city. The city has a physiology where, that's where urban economics comes in. The physiology in fact is explained by urban economics and so you have to go back and forth between the theory and the detail.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001626&quot; id=&quot;001626&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:16:26)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, definitely. And that firsthand experience gives you lots of stories and anecdotes to really understand with intuition what's going on, but then you can draw those out into broader lessons that you can then bring in apply. And one thing I love about the life that you and Marie-Agnes have lived together is that you've both lived together, is that you've lived in so many different places and experienced them both as residents as well as planners and urbanists. Was that something that you intended to do with your life or did it just sort of end up being that way and in the end you pulled all the threads together?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001702&quot; id=&quot;001702&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:17:02)&lt;/a&gt; Well we certainly, both Marie-Agnes and I, we love traveling and we are absolutely not afraid of a new environment and new, we are not attached to land. For Marie-Agnes, yes it's because she always lived in a foreign country in fact. She knew she was French in a foreign country, so one day she would have to leave. So I think it was natural to her. For me, my father liked traveling a lot. He traveled a lot and kept traveling to his death practically around the world. And so I learned these things about traveling, being an important and observing, looking around was something which was important. So we definitely wanted to travel. It was a bit a romantic thing. It was a bit the romanticism of the explorer of the 19th century, that discovering. I remember reading about René Caillié, the first European went to Timbuktu. For me this was really the wonderful thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001811&quot; id=&quot;001811&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:18:11)&lt;/a&gt; Of course it was a little too late in the century to discover Timbuktu, but it was the next best thing in a way to become. So when I graduated, we were trying to apply for a job as urban planner in a foreign country. Probably the, the easiest way would have been a former French colony. We were looking at Cambodia or Vietnam or area like that and then we had a friend was just coming from an American college. She had been in Oberlin College in Ohio and she was French and she had spent one year there and she said, &quot;The United States is so different. It's so incredible and you should at least spend a year there before you go to Cambodia or Africa, whatever.&quot; And she somehow convinced us. It was a time, so that was 1967, it was a time, she came back with a record of Bob Dylan and thing like that which was complicated for sure for us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#001918&quot; id=&quot;001918&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:19:18)&lt;/a&gt; And so we decided to do that for one year, go to the US for one year just to get an experience. And then we, in a way the US became our base. We traveled a lot after that, but became our base. I mean it was certainly decision to travel, but to spend a lot or at least a number of years traveling. But there was no real plan and so we arrive in the US at this job, found a job with Philip Johnson, the architect in New York and Marie-Agnes had to learn English there and she learned about few months and she was able to have a job with the city planning commission after that. That's drafting thing and things like that and doing surveys.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002012&quot; id=&quot;002012&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:20:12)&lt;/a&gt; So we integrated. We loved the New York very much, but then there was this, we saw an advertisement for Yemen. I told Marie-Agnes one evening, &quot;Hey, there's this job for an urban planner in Yemen.&quot; She immediately say, &quot;Yes, this is wonderful. Let's go.&quot; And by that time we had two young children. So that's rather unique because many of my friends or relative sometime the spouse, the man have a drop somewhere because of his career. He has to move from Paris to Leon, Marseilles or whatever. And usually the wife says, &quot;No, no, no. We have a house here. We have our friend. We cannot move.&quot; Now Marine-Agnes is opposite. She was absolutely delighted. She had no problem with that. So again, that was not, and then from there so we went from, we spent two and a half years in New York and then for Yemen we had the contract of two years and then we renew it for one year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002122&quot; id=&quot;002122&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:21:22)&lt;/a&gt; So we spent three years in Yemen and that was under the UN. But again, it was not planned and after we loved Yemen and we loved the job there. The only problem we realize is that we had no cure there. I was the only urban planner, architect in the entire country and the people who like me praised my work, but usually I had a lot of support. Everybody with the government and everybody, I was, we were very popular in a way because we... But we had no feedback professionally. We thought that at the end we will become kind of a notability in Yemen, but maybe we were not doing the right thing because we were just alone. Nobody criticize us for what we're doing. So we decided to... at the time though there was a World Bank project in Yemen the last year, the last year we were there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002222&quot; id=&quot;002222&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:22:22)&lt;/a&gt; And among all the foreigners coming to Yemen after the end of the civil war, the World Bank was only one I was impressed with. I think the other many of these visitors were a bit amateurs and the World Bank seems to have an approach which was leading to projects, didn't get to lending, to specific project, not just something fuzzy and they had money too, of course to finance those projects. So I thought that was interesting. So after we left Yemen, I went to Washington and I had an interview with the World Bank with my background again Chandigarh, India, Algeria, Yemen and New York, it was a good resume. So they offered me a job because at the time they had just started an urban department, up to that date.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002324&quot; id=&quot;002324&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:23:24)&lt;/a&gt; That was in '74 they had mostly financed big infrastructure like highways, railways, ports, and McNamara decided that cities were important and that a bank should have a special department just for cities. So I was very lucky again here, very lucky to arrive at this moment. So they offered me a job, but at the same time I had an interview with a small consulting firm who happened to have a job doing the master plan of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. And again talking with Marie-Agnes she was very enthusiastic about going to Haiti because compared to Yemen, this will be a complete cultural difference, that nothing in common with the two countries certainly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002413&quot; id=&quot;002413&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:24:13)&lt;/a&gt; And so we decided to accept the job in Haiti. So I called the World Bank and say, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not taking the job. I'm going to Haiti instead,&quot; and they were absolutely furious. They could not understand how you could refuse it, a job at the World Bank for doing the master plan of Port-au- Prince. So I told them, &quot;Well after two years in Haiti I will have more experience in the field a very different country, a different culture. I will be more useful to the World Bank if you are still interested,&quot; and the guy on the phone bang the phone and say &quot;After two years in Haiti you will be useless,&quot; and then he hang up the phone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002451&quot; id=&quot;002451&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:24:51)&lt;/a&gt; So you both have spent a lot of time in a lot of new cities and done some really good work in shaping master plans and various rules and regulations. What's your process for understanding a new city? So let's say I drop you in Dar es-Salaam Tanzania, which I understand is a place you've never been before and I just give you six days to get to know the city and ask you to give me recommendations to improve the way it's run.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002516&quot; id=&quot;002516&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:25:16)&lt;/a&gt; First thing, when I know where I'm going especially now with the technology, the Google has satellite imagery. I go on the internet and I adjust it before and I just check Dar es-Salaam Tanzania and I get the city of Dar es-Salaam and then navigate in the city and I can realize already a number of things will be very interesting to investigate when before going and I use satellite imagery Googlers in many, many of the new project we are having now and we do that on my computer and I use-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002603&quot; id=&quot;002603&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:26:03)&lt;/a&gt; And we do that on my computer, and I use a satellite imagery and all the tools that go with Google Pro, Google Earth Pro, and started to measure and look at the different type of construction, different type of development, where the cities is located. Dar es Salaam is a port, and is in Tanzania, and I check the facility along the port, I check the airport, I will check all the different type of land use, industries, residential. And you can check on the... Dar es Salaam, for example, you have formal and informal development. And just by looking at those images you can already see that there is a huge proportion of the population live in slum, not a slum, but informal development. May not be necessarily terrible, but you can see the shape of the plot, the type of houses, and you can also, on the internet, check for the population of the cities, where are the possibility of, what will be the next population in 20 years or 30 years from now?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pull-quote medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&quot;In many of the places we have lived, there was no existing map.&quot; — Marie-Agnes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002736&quot; id=&quot;002736&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:27:36)&lt;/a&gt; The projection, for example, Dar es Salaam now is four million point three and they projected for 2015, 20 million. So the city will grow as much in less than 50 years in 40 years, and you need to have more development. And I can already check in the satellite imagery where the development will happen. And you can see already on the edge of the city a number of new developments starting land where have been clear. And so you can already before going, do your own work and do an evaluation of what is the city now and what you expect when you arrive there? So in six days I can already before leaving, register a number of sites where I can go when I should go to take some more information concerning the condition of the houses, the condition of the people live in this place. Have they access to water? Have they access to school? Have they access to other facilities? So it's a huge... We are in this, years now, compare it to what, my first study in Karachi was done about the same way as I just described now, is because of the access, before you go, having access to information that it cost nothing compared to the \$10,000 the World Bank pay for the satellite imagery. Here you have any place on Earth in Google Earth Pro. All the information you can get before you step in a place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#002941&quot; id=&quot;002941&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:29:41)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. That bird's eye view is so important. I've recently started using this app called Zenly, which it's sort of like Find My Friends, but sort of in the Snapchat age if you want to think of it in those terms. And what it does is it tracks your location around the city and you can see how much of the city you've actually explored. And it's been very surprising for me. I live in San Francisco and I thought I knew this city really well, but according to Zenly, I have only seen 13% of the city because what I do is I go to all the same neighborhoods. My friends tend to live in certain neighborhoods, not in other neighborhoods, and so I've started trying to, now that I have that perspective on the map, I've been trying to explore other parts of the city that I don't go to as much. And so I love your approach here of the bird's eye view of the satellite imagery so that you get more of a holistic sense of what the city looks like as opposed to just getting to know the places that you happen to be on that visit, or the places with restaurants that looked nice to go to or where your hotel or home, where you're staying is.&lt;div class=&quot;small-wrap-pull-right img-no-shadow--wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-no-shadow--wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e50e2c88-1565-4ad5-a0cc-ad50603ce27e/dc3f9fa6-5f1b-4a87-ae90-9bf3b4530a89.png&quot; width=&quot;169&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003049&quot; id=&quot;003049&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 3 (00:30:49)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003049&quot; id=&quot;003049&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:30:49)&lt;/a&gt; Exactly. And the very good thing I do also like you do when we have to visit a friend and we don't know the place. Okay. You go to Google Map, but also you have with Google Map the satellite data. And if you zoom in the place at the location you're going, you know before in advance where the people live is a house, is an apartment, is it next to a subway? If you don't drive, what are the means of transportation you can get, you can have, to go to this place? So, so much information now is available compared to when we started say, how many years now? 15 years ago where we were working on cities and before you were related only of books or maps, existing map, but many of the place we have been, you know in a developing world, there were no map, no existing map, and I remember when we arrive in Sanaa, Yemen, Alain has no map and maybe he can tell you the story but he took his Land Rover and goes to the next mountain next to Sanaa.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003214&quot; id=&quot;003214&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:32:14)&lt;/a&gt; There's a huge mountain and he go up to there and took out his camera and took photo of the city. But we have located now all the planners and when we teach at NYU now, and people start to look at the data we have gathered and I said, &quot;Look, you are lucky you are living in a data driving society and you should use the data.&quot; In the US, you have access to all the data compared to when we are in India or someplace, and we can derive a lot of information with a satellite, with existing data, managing information as I do with the satellite imagery and map. We match information for population, land value, location of school, network for public transport, access to the public transport according to the network of transport.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003328&quot; id=&quot;003328&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:33:28)&lt;/a&gt; And so you can match population who can have access to a metro station. For example, calculate around the metro station, say a kilometer around this metro station, how many population can be having access to the station in less than 10 minutes walk? Before to do a study like we are doing now with the computer, it will take six months. And now with the technology we have on hand, with your graphic information system, satellite imagery, existing map, merging data, it can done in one month.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003412&quot; id=&quot;003412&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:34:12)&lt;/a&gt; I imagine this doesn't just change the quantity but also the quality of the work that you do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003418&quot; id=&quot;003418&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:34:18)&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely. Before we were, like in Karachi at first, in order to have access to those aerial photo, I have to prove that I was having already this formation in hand. I came with a big print of the satellite imagery that I carry with me and when they see what I was having as already information, they let me dig in their door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003450&quot; id=&quot;003450&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:34:50)&lt;/a&gt; If not, I will have asked three or four officers and then be accompanied to security guard just to open the door of the aerial photo of the city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003506&quot; id=&quot;003506&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:35:06)&lt;/a&gt; Why were they so protective of that data?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003508&quot; id=&quot;003508&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:35:08)&lt;/a&gt; At that time and still now, they have a potential of war between India and Pakistan. And they thought if we have access to those aerial photo, someone, a spy like me, they thought maybe I may be a spy that can take picture or copy of the photo and target and if the coordinate of these place and if someone targeted this place with bombs or anything.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003538&quot; id=&quot;003538&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:35:38)&lt;/a&gt; I see. So given aerial photography or looking at Google Maps and once you've sort of done your homework before going into a place, how do you decide which sites you want to go to and how do you get around the city?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003550&quot; id=&quot;003550&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (00:35:50)&lt;/a&gt; In the Google Earth now, I will check the coordinate of different type of development, land use development, housing development, and infrastructure, location of schools, and all these services. And after that, I will maybe survey, go to the site and survey maybe 20 place in less than six days. You can do that, no problem. You just order a taxi or an interpreter if you don't speak the language. That was the case in Karachi, few people speak English. So with an interpreter, a driver, and myself, we visit in less than three days, 20 site. Took measurement, question the situation of the people for what to supply, problem, et cetera.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003652&quot; id=&quot;003652&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:36:52)&lt;/a&gt; So Alain?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003653&quot; id=&quot;003653&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:36:53)&lt;/a&gt; Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003654&quot; id=&quot;003654&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:36:54)&lt;/a&gt; What's your process for understanding a new city? Say I drop you in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and give you six days to get to know the city, and then I ask you to give me recommendations for how to improve the way it's run. Where would you start?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003707&quot; id=&quot;003707&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:37:07)&lt;/a&gt; Well, do you drop me within an institution or do you drop me just like a tourist, like saying, so that's quite different actually. So you see if you arrive but you have already contacted an institution, usually you have a contract with a municipality or something, with your company or... So, the first thing is a contact with this institution. But on the other hand, you could work in a situation where you don't know anybody and you are just asked by some other institution, maybe international, give me a quick assessment of what the city is like. You know, what is its potential or something. So, that's two different things. You know the approach will be a little different in either situation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003802&quot; id=&quot;003802&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:38:02)&lt;/a&gt; So, if I am dropped there and say well, let's say you are an international institution and say what is Dar es Salaam like? And of course, normally you would have read something about it, but if you are not, the first thing is to go look of course now at the satellite imagery, as Marie-Agnes has said. But for me, really, a lot of it is just to walk through the streets. On the satellite, you will select some neighborhoods you absolutely want to visit. And if you can have a local contact, it could be a taxi driver, it could be somebody you meet in the street, or in a cafe, start asking question. But the most important thing is to just look. Look what happened. And if you are experienced in looking at cities, there are certain things in every city which will surprise you. You know why do you have a barbershop at this corner? And this is unusual. Why would you have no department store in this city? There are cities, for instance, which have no Central Business District (CBD). So you ask this question and you try to understand why it is like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#003929&quot; id=&quot;003929&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:39:29)&lt;/a&gt; Also, what is important is to observe, there's a wide area of incomes within a city and you should have a complete sample of what Marie-Agnes has called the topology, the type of housing where these different people of different income live. Many people will visit the city, usually stay in the most comfortable area. You have to go everywhere. And so again, before the satellite imagery, when you have just a plan or a tourist plan, you had to discover those neighborhoods a bit randomly by walking around. I had a methodology before, was to start from the center and then walk, say east, or west, or south, for two or three hours until I reached the outskirt of the city. To have a complete cross-section of the city, at least in several axes, in order to see how it is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004039&quot; id=&quot;004039&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:40:39)&lt;/a&gt; And then you stumble there on, obviously, maybe randomly, but on very low income neighborhood, middle income, high income, and you observe how much land they consume, how tall are the building? If they are well-built, if they are not well-built and things like that. When you are experienced enough by having seen many cities, you could even, by looking at the neighborhood, roughly assess to the density, the number of people per hectare and usually you are not wrong, maybe you are wrong by 10% but not much more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004119&quot; id=&quot;004119&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:41:19)&lt;/a&gt; As you walk around, do you have a particular rubric or particular categories that you are trying to keep an eye on and sort of fill out a list? Or is it just whatever catches your eye, you'll note it down and then think about it later?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004131&quot; id=&quot;004131&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:41:31)&lt;/a&gt; Yes, whatever catch my eye. But say, the way people use land, if you have a lot of commerce in the street. On the country, there are cities which are completely shuttered in, you see very few shops, or the shops are all concentrated in one street and the rest are entirely residential, for instance. So those things are very important to observe because they usually, sometimes people are obliged to do something in a certain way because, for regulation or poverty, but most of the time it's a choice they are making. They are making a trade off. And you have to understand this trade off and you have to be completely, in a way, do not judge it by the standard of your own culture. If you judge by comparing cities to another as one being... Say, if you live in New York and say, well New York is really a wonderful city and you go to Dar es Salaam, you will always say, well, there's no grid, the buildings are too low or things like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004249&quot; id=&quot;004249&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:42:49)&lt;/a&gt; So you have to completely abstract to judge it, to say, well this is the way people do things. Now, there are certain things that you realize are, for instance, if you see an open sewer in the middle of the street, you know that this is not because people like it that way. It's because they are too poor to pay for a sewer. Or maybe because the municipality is so incompetent that they are completely unable to put a sewer there. So you don't take that as it's a cultural thing that they enjoy the sewer, but there are certain things that are cultural and you have to respect that, and not infer your own culture on it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004331&quot; id=&quot;004331&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:43:31)&lt;/a&gt; What do most people who develop cities, including urban planners, urban economists, mayors, other local representatives, what do they not pay enough attention to? And what do you think that they pay too much attention to?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004343&quot; id=&quot;004343&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:43:43)&lt;/a&gt; They don't pay enough attention to mobility first. You know the way people move around the city. Many planners, or even mayors, consider that mobility is a bad thing. That if you could work and live in the same place, it will be wonderful, which is not mobility. Mobility means that you can move around the city and maybe work at civil jobs or something that and change up. So they consider that, very often, mobility is the enemy, where in fact mobility is a friend of the city. And the other thing is affordability. It's important that there's enough supply of land so that everybody, whatever his income, can afford a house. And it's a necessity in a city. I mean it's a reality that you have a wide array of income within the city.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004448&quot; id=&quot;004448&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:44:48)&lt;/a&gt; In my book I describe civil income distribution curve. You should not divide the population into low income, middle income, and high income. You should have a complete income distribution curve. Some planners have a tendency when they work in developing country to feel also that poverty is a necessity, not a necessity, but it's fate, and that the city should be designed entirely for the poor. Implying that development, economic development, is not important, that you have just to get it to the poor. Others have just the opposite saying, &quot;Well everybody should be rich and even people who are too poor maybe should not live in a city.&quot; So you see you have those two extremes. For politician, they are very reluctant usually to admit that a lot of people in their city are poor and that it will take time for them to become non poor, to reach a middle class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004556&quot; id=&quot;004556&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:45:56)&lt;/a&gt; And so they tend to hide it, or to even wish that those people will go away by making life difficult for them. So, that's even the worst thing they can do. Because for me, the job of a city, especially a city in a country which is developing, which is urbanizing, it's a machine for taking people with low skill from rural area, where they have skill in a rural area, but their skills are usually not very useful in the city. So take those people with low skills, and within maybe half a generation, if you are successful, or one generation, transform them to citizens who have an urban job, who are very productive in the city. And the faster you integrate those people in the city life, the more successful is a city. And the success of the city should be measured by that, how fast you integrate this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004656&quot; id=&quot;004656&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:46:56)&lt;/a&gt; For instance a city like Hong Kong, or even Singapore, but Singapore is a very special story. But Hong Kong, I knew on Hong Kong, I visited Hong Kong in what 1977? I think '76. The first time and they were still have slums in Hong Kong, really bad slums. And the city managed, because they were a lot of refugees coming from China, people were escaping from Mao China, and arriving in Hong Kong with just a shirt on their back. And the city of Hong Kong was able, within half a generation, to integrate these people in city life, in an urban life. And that's again for me, that's the success of the city. That's integration here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#004745&quot; id=&quot;004745&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:47:45)&lt;/a&gt; Now, these are cities which are growing. In this century now, we are going to see a lot of cities which are not growing, or even shrinking. The cities of Europe are going to shrink, unless they take care of immigrant. And it's possible that if you stop the flow of immigration in the US, you will have also shrinking cities. So, that's a very different problem. But you will still have a lot of cities growing extremely fast like in Africa and Asia, so you will have this duality where in all my career, I was always dealing with cities which were growing fast, either growing fast because you had migration from the countryside, like India or China or Indonesia, or because incomes were going up. And so the city, that was the case in Paris for instance the '50s '60s, income was going up very fast, household size were going down. So that means that the city has also to develop and change very fast to accommodate those changes. So but now we will see cities which are, I have visited such cities in Japan. Cities which are very affluent too, which are very nicely designed, very nicely managed. But their main problem is losing population. And this is something, it's a bit like, in monitoring a field, you know to deal with inflation. Nobody knows how to deal with deflation. And it will be a bit the same thing for a city. I could see the struggle of those mayor who have shrinking cities, very competent mayors, very competent with disparity, running the system extremely well. And I had no idea to solve these problems. You know, once, when I was in Russia, that was about 10 years ago, and I was doing a study on, they asked me to do a study on the new master plan of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. And then they asked me, &quot;Could you help us? We are going to close 60 cities in Russia and could you help us to do that?&quot; And I told them, &quot;I have no idea what to do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005013&quot; id=&quot;005013&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:50:13)&lt;/a&gt; I mean it's an interesting problem. We are ready to look at it, but I have no experience at all. My experience is just opposite, closing cities, I don't know. And they had to close cities because of demography, and cities which were badly located at the time of communism. So they were a city of 200,000 people. We had to just close them and bring people back to two cities which had the economic potential. So I don't think we will close cities in Western Europe, but I think that they will be very, very serious demographic problem unless we consider that immigration is not just being nice with people, or something like that. But immigration is in fact an economic necessity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005106&quot; id=&quot;005106&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Speaker 2 (00:51:06)&lt;/a&gt; In cases like Europe and Japan where cities are depopulating but not necessarily going so far as closing, what happens to the city when it loses population? Why is that bad?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005118&quot; id=&quot;005118&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:51:18)&lt;/a&gt; Well, first, when it loses population, it means usually that it's aging. You know that you have a lot of old... The active population become a smaller part of the total population. Those cities usually are affluent, and therefore they have a welfare system. There is a lot of transfer between active people to inactive people. And when the inactive people become more numerous and the active people, it's a burden. It's a tax burden on the active one, which is unbearable. That's why they moved to larger, usually larger cities where they... That's a case of Tokyo first. Tokyo is still growing, it-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005203&quot; id=&quot;005203&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:03)&lt;/a&gt; That's the case of Tokyo, first. Tokyo is still growing at 1% or 2% a year, but it's growing not because of natural demography, it's growing because it's taking the young people from smaller city which are losing population.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005217&quot; id=&quot;005217&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:17)&lt;/a&gt; The problem with that, for instance, in Toyama, one of the city where we spent quite some time, we spent about a week there, two, three years ago, the problem was that there were entire area where the houses were abandoned. If you have a shrinking population, you have houses, and there's nobody to buy those houses, so they stay empty. So you have, in a way, the same problem that they had in Detroit at the same time, when they lost population, too. That those houses are deteriorating. You have to bulldoze them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005257&quot; id=&quot;005257&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:52:57)&lt;/a&gt; The municipality in Toyama was trying to consolidate whatever people were left in those neighborhoods, to try to move them back to the center of the city, because it's very difficult to run services in a neighborhood where half of the houses are empty. Your sewer system and all that doesn't work very well anymore. Your schools, you still need some schools, but the schools have only two or three students per class, so you have to consolidate them. It's a very, very big problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005331&quot; id=&quot;005331&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:53:31)&lt;/a&gt; If I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that leaving the houses abandoned is not just a problem of now the houses deteriorate, but also the services don't scale as well across the rest of the community, and so it becomes more expensive for everybody. Is this part of the reason why, in Detroit, people's water ended up being turned off, because it was just too expensive for the city to serve their half-empty neighborhood?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005356&quot; id=&quot;005356&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:53:56)&lt;/a&gt; Yes. I think that's one of the reasons. One of the absurd reasons, too, in Detroit that I found, I don't know if it's still true now. I learn it about last year, is that the city, when a building was abandoned, the city will still charge whoever was legally owning this building the property tax. So anybody who wanted to redevelop this building, it was usually not in good condition, would have to pay all the arrear of property tax. And that made it uneconomical to develop it in a way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005440&quot; id=&quot;005440&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:54:40)&lt;/a&gt; So I think that, in a way, one of the problems in Detroit I think was really the attitude of the municipality. The municipality should consider property tax as a ... it's a tax on productivity. If the lot has no production, it's not productivity. Well, you have no reason to tax it. I'm a big fan of property tax, by the way. It's not that I think that it should not be. But I think that the city should realize the impact it has when ... a lot of people will be attracted to go to a city where land and housing is extremely cheap. You could buy a house in Detroit, I suppose, at some neighborhoods for probably $ 50, $100. So it's a good bargain. But if you have to pay \$50,000 of arrears in property tax, it's not a good bargain, because you're ... so then you end up continuing the problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005545&quot; id=&quot;005545&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:55:45)&lt;/a&gt; Well, that's Detroit problem. But say, Toyama, the city we visited in Japan was losing population. Didn't have this problem. But their problem was, in a way, when they move people from a suburb to the center, the value of the house in the suburb is zero, even if it's in good condition, because there's no taker. So you see, you have a loss of the value of capital assets. When you have a shrinking city, this is the problem you have. Where, normally, a city is thriving because of the value of capital assets, if your capital assets are shrinking, and shrinking not only by losing value but shrinking in terms of size, the size of the city, then it's a huge problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005642&quot; id=&quot;005642&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:56:42)&lt;/a&gt; Again, the older utilities, all the infrastructure of the city, which is the major capital expenditure of a city, sewer system, transport, schools, hospital, are based on these certain densities. If this density go much lower than the current, you have a big restructuring problem, and if you have still, let's say, 300 inhabitant in a neighborhood, and you close the school, and you don't maintain the water very well or you cut it, then it become uninhabitable, and those people are not happy, obviously. You have to take care of them. They are just like if they were homeless, although they are in fact middle class people who had a very nice house. But you have to take care of them like if they were homeless.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005730&quot; id=&quot;005730&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:57:30)&lt;/a&gt; In these cities, as they're growing, when Detroit was in its boom town, as Japan's population was growing, they made certain assumptions around how many people would be in a particular place, how much investment to make in the infrastructure. And now you still have to maintain the infrastructure, but the assumptions are now wrong. And so you're in this position where the value added for the cost is not as high, but people are depending on that infrastructure for their life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005756&quot; id=&quot;005756&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:57:56)&lt;/a&gt; And in a way, if you ... I don't know if you have followed the gilets jaunes, yellow vest riots in France last year, but one of their, let's say, one of their complaints was that in smaller town, or some rural area, the population was shrinking, and therefore the government was canceling a lot of service. Post office will close, school will close, small dispensary hospital will close. If you ... maternity, for instance, before, a woman was delivering a baby will be within 20 minutes, let's say, maximum from an hospital with a maternity, and suddenly became an hour and a half.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005845&quot; id=&quot;005845&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:58:45)&lt;/a&gt; This was, again, because of a shrinking population in a rural area, in small towns. You have to say, &quot;We are going to tax more the people who are more productive in the cities, in order to maintain people in non-productive area, where they cannot be very productive.&quot; But we have to maintain a maternity in an area where they will deliver maybe 15 babies a year, which is not financially feasible. Or it's a big luxury, if you do that. So the taxes for the other are increasing, and to maintain people who are in the location which are not very productive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005934&quot; id=&quot;005934&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (00:59:34)&lt;/a&gt; Again, I'm thinking aloud here, because I think nobody has tackled this problem really. Probably the Japanese now are starting to look at it that way, and the Korean are next now. And the Chinese are going to be next, in the next 20 years, probably they will have the same problem of Japan's.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#005956&quot; id=&quot;005956&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (00:59:56)&lt;/a&gt; I have sympathy for both sides of this equation, because on one hand, you don't want to cut off maternity service to a family that has built their life around being in a particular place. On the other hand, you want to be able to help as many people in a society as possible, and if you're expending a lot of resources to help one particular household, when potentially you could support 10 at that same price point, it makes sense to try to encourage people to move to the cities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010023&quot; id=&quot;010023&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:00:23)&lt;/a&gt; Have you seen any efforts by various cities or societies that try to encourage people to move to the cities with some sort of incentive? Or not necessarily to cities, but to places where the infrastructure costs are more reasonable?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010039&quot; id=&quot;010039&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:00:39)&lt;/a&gt; The only place I've seen is Japan. Yeah. The Japanese are doing that. Yes, yes. But to do that, they still need subsidy from the central government. Again, you have this question of, do you maintain services in area which ... the resources of a country are limited. If you maintain those services in those empty area, or nearly empty area, you have to decrease the services in the one which are productive. There's no ... or you increase the taxes enormously. But it means a very large amount of increase in taxes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010120&quot; id=&quot;010120&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:01:20)&lt;/a&gt; And there are some services when you cannot increase productivity. For instance, I think all the medical service, where you can computerize all lot of things, but it's very labor intensive. A teacher, for instance, you cannot, so far, unless we manage to teach children entirely with computers, but normally, a teacher productivity cannot be increased. But that's not true of some services.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010153&quot; id=&quot;010153&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:01:53)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. And it'll be interesting to see how different countries and different cities approach these problems. Because in the United States, we have some similar challenges, though not just with depopulation, but also we've spent generations paving roads, building highways, far into the wilderness, that costs a lot of money, to create that much roadway over such a large country, instead of investing in core cities. That's sort of, in my opinion, a bit of a self-imposed problem. But then also, to compound that with the fact that those towns that we've built roads out to maybe depopulating even faster now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010232&quot; id=&quot;010232&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:02:32)&lt;/a&gt; Right, yeah. But, you see, in the US, you have also the way your political structure is organized, around state, and the density of the state is not taken into account. It's only ... so that will compound the thing, in a way. You have two senators per state, so every state wants the same amount of roads. But that's beyond my ... I must say this is a political organization which is completely beyond my competence, but ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010307&quot; id=&quot;010307&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:03:07)&lt;/a&gt; And the structure of the politics, and the way that institutions are formed really affects the way that these decisions can be made. I imagine in Japan, because so much is centered around Tokyo, and it's such a central part of all of Japanese society, whereas the US is a much more distributed country, and states have a lot more decision-making power.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010328&quot; id=&quot;010328&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:03:28)&lt;/a&gt; Although Japan has still a number of cities like Osaka who are still very dynamic, but there are only three or four left, yes. Right. Yeah. With trust-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010339&quot; id=&quot;010339&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:03:39)&lt;/a&gt; Right. And many more decisions are made at the national level. I know the zoning laws are basically determined at the national level.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010347&quot; id=&quot;010347&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:03:47)&lt;/a&gt; More stunning, though, by the way ... it's very specific to the US to have this extreme decentralization of zoning law. The, let's say, many country, the mayor takes decision whether an area is residential or industrial, that that's done at a local level. But usually the definition of what is residential, that forces what will be the density, what will be the standards, is usually national or regional. And here in the US, any city can decide, or to calculate floor ratio, any town can decide or to calculate floor ratio, or to calculate the height of a building. If you have maximum heights. In my town, in Glen Rock, the way you calculate the height of a building is different from the next town of Ridgewood, which is just across, you know ... so this extreme decentralization is specific to the US, by the way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010447&quot; id=&quot;010447&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:04:47)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. I could list an endless list of disadvantages of that approach. But I'm curious, what do you see as the advantages? What are the plus sides?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010456&quot; id=&quot;010456&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:04:56)&lt;/a&gt; Well, the plus side is, of course, the feeling that the citizen are in charge. But I think that if you have very small boundaries ... there is some literature on that. Some economists say, &quot;Well, all those small town, say 8,000 people, 5,000 people, are just like clubs. So they decide how much tax they want to use, and they decide their infrastructure or their standards according ... the same way as you have club, you have rich man club and you have poor man's club.&quot; So if we want to adjust to what ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010533&quot; id=&quot;010533&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:05:33)&lt;/a&gt; I am not very convinced by that, because, at the end, especially if those cities, these towns, are part of a larger metropolitan area, they tend to be very ... I won't use the word egoistic, but say, in a way, they don't want any large hospital, for instance. They don't want certainly anything to process waste. And because they know they can use it at a metropolitan level, somebody else will have it. They don't want people slightly lower income than they have, so they will adjust their zoning so that nobody with a lower income than them could come, by imposing, again, minimum floor size or things like that, or a floor ratio.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010626&quot; id=&quot;010626&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:06:26)&lt;/a&gt; I'm not sure it's a such a good thing. You know? What is optimum size? I don't know. I think that many decision on land use should be taken at the metropolitan size. Even with a referendum and something ... in a way, the way the Swiss are doing, where a lot of decision in Switzerland are taken at the cantonal level, canton is ... sometime it correspond to a city, but very often it's a group of villages, really. And you vote for everything. But it's relatively large, compared to a town in the US.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010714&quot; id=&quot;010714&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:07:14)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. Something I find quite frustrating in my own metropolitan region of San Francisco, the Bay Area, is that there's a lot of people who I think think of themselves as standing up for minority rights, for poor people's rights, and things like that, and being very progressive, but actually, they're ... and they certainly are, they generally vote that way on the issues that they realize affect those people. But I think they then will push for things like minimum floor size, or not allowing an apartment to be built in their neighborhood, not having access to ... yeah. Pushing out waste facilities to poorer towns nearby, without really thinking about it in those terms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010757&quot; id=&quot;010757&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:07:57)&lt;/a&gt; Instead, they think, &quot;Oh, well, of course I don't want my child to have to walk past a sewage facility.&quot; No one wants to make their child do that. But by having more political power and time, and pushing those things out, and saying, &quot;We don't want these problems within our neighborhood,&quot; it then ends up impacting people, I would argue, actually more than some of the other issues that people may push for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010822&quot; id=&quot;010822&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:08:22)&lt;/a&gt; Something I've been trying to figure out how to do is how to ... one of the things I'm excited about for this podcast is how you and Marie-Agnes have this great view of human flourishing in general, beyond just the most obvious hot button issues, but also how the shape of the city ends up really impacting people's lives.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010843&quot; id=&quot;010843&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:08:43)&lt;/a&gt; Right. Yes, yes, yes. Certainly, yeah. Those trade off, and in a way, some decision I think will be better taken, I think, at the metropolitan level, just using, in a way, a non-political view, but just a technocratic view. But other decisions are better at the political level. I still, I think, as a planner, we have to recognize that, at the end, it's an elected mayor, who established the priorities. There is no scientific way of establishing priorities. These are political decisions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#010926&quot; id=&quot;010926&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:09:26)&lt;/a&gt; Now, as a technician, you can also of course try to influence a mayor, saying, &quot;Well, you have a really bad housing problem, and we had better deal with it before it become really even more acute,&quot; and you can document it and probably convincing. I am a strong believer in convincing people, by the way. I think people have reason, they use reason. They use passion, but they use also reason. And I think that sometimes we neglect a bit this aspect, that if you have a well well-informed argument and you are not pompous about it or pedantic about it, you can convince people what is the right thing to do. And it's easier to convince a metropolitan population to do the right thing than to convince a neighborhood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011019&quot; id=&quot;011019&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:10:19)&lt;/a&gt; As you've lived in all these different cities and worked in all these different cities, it seems like you've built really strong relationships with many of the locals, both just normal residents, but also people within the government, and with NGOs, and the UN. How did it feel to work with other people in each of these places, and how did the work culture differ?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011041&quot; id=&quot;011041&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:10:41)&lt;/a&gt; We, in Yemen, for example, I was the only woman working in the office, and because of being a woman in a country where men and women are separately, I was having some advantage here, because I was a foreign woman. I could go in the two society, the women and the men. And women have different way to see life than men. The men are entertaining themself, and the women stays in between themself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011117&quot; id=&quot;011117&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:11:17)&lt;/a&gt; There are two way to entertaining, to be entertained, but they love to receive. And I was all the time when we were invited to a party or to a gathering, the women have nothing to do with the life outside the house. So I was, when we go inside a house, I will all the time let the men go first, and the men normally goes up to the top floor, where they receive the guests, and the women are living in the first floor, second floor, third floor. So I will be working behind the men, and turning my head, and the women will grab me by the hand and drag me to their kitchen or to their room, and then with my poor Arabic, I was still able to converse with the women, and see the situation they were living in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011218&quot; id=&quot;011218&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:12:18)&lt;/a&gt; For example, in a kitchen, the women are cooking with charcoal and wood, and there were no evacuation for the smoke. So most of the women, after cooking in front of the fire, get conjunctivitis, red eyes, and there was a little problem there. And so we realize that it was an obligation for the future house to have a kind of evacuation for the smoke. And we build in our house, we build a little fireplace with evacuation, and a fireplace with an evacuation, and people will come to visit our house. And they will see that we have a made an improvement in a way we should have the kitchen be having a smoke evacuation for the fumes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011322&quot; id=&quot;011322&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:13:22)&lt;/a&gt; But this is in Yemen. In other place, women participate. I works in Indonesia and the women are having, in Indonesia, a lot to say and they are participating in the work, in the office, and be, again, a woman, it was the same thing as in Yemen. I could talk to the women more about women problem than men can talk, especially in Muslim country, like in Indonesia. They are not all Muslim, but the majority are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011404&quot; id=&quot;011404&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:14:04)&lt;/a&gt; Also, the work with NGO. There were few NGO in Yemen, when we were there, because the country was not yet in the map for many people, and the only NGO were the few NGO was working with the embassies. So there were people were just there for few days, and doing some data gathering, but they have nothing to do with what we were doing, most of the NGO. But in Indonesia the NGO are very active, and when you visit a site in a slum ... not a slum, they call a compound, it's a village who have been integrated to a city, who receive ... where the government give some very infrastructure, like the water, the sewage, garbage collection. And they also monitor the school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011506&quot; id=&quot;011506&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:15:06)&lt;/a&gt; So the compound in Indonesia are very organized, and many work are done by the women there. So we connect with those women, and we get to to work with them, for doing some surveys in the place, or something like this. We have, Alain and I, some kind of loners, some people think, because we are a team, and we work together, and the people let us work together because they know we are very efficient, and we connect with the other group of people. If it's the World Bank, we connect for the other information we need, and we have good relation with all the people in the field, with the local people we have to work with, or with the people that works with the World Bank, or professional who are working with us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011610&quot; id=&quot;011610&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:16:10)&lt;/a&gt; The professional in Yemen, they give me so much lead. One time, I wanted to get Yemeni promote the artisanal production. They were doing a number of beautiful thing, like pots, and embroideries, and they were starting to have some tourists coming to Yemen. And I discussed with the people in the ministry of tourism, and I propose to make a little shop where the tourists can buy things that are interesting for tourism. The little pottery or little fabrics and dresses that the Yemeni do embroider, and they give me free lead, and give me cash money, to do all the things I was supposed to do, without any discussion about how I'll operate or anything.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011728&quot; id=&quot;011728&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:17:28)&lt;/a&gt; The Yemeni were very keen on having people doing the work they thought they couldn't immediately figure out. So I did that in less than two months. I built a little art shop next to the post office in Sana'a, and we gather all the things that tourists are interested, and the shop was successful, but the Yemeni are not good for maintenance, and I was not interested in-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011803&quot; id=&quot;011803&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:18:03)&lt;/a&gt; ... and I was not interested in doing all the managing of the place and we couldn't find anybody to take care, so fortunately things fall out. But we are very easy... I mean I connect very easy with any people. I speak some Spanish and some Arabic and we managed to speak some Thai, even though Thai is more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011836&quot; id=&quot;011836&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:18:36)&lt;/a&gt; But we all the time have very easy, I mean we have a lot of friends, so much friends in Yemen that we will blush to pretend that we are not there. We will close all the windows. And there was one home where we have a skylight, with the children at night we will retreat in a room without any window in it and we have light, just a low light and we will not respond to the bell because they were coming at any time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#011915&quot; id=&quot;011915&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Marie-Agnes (01:19:15)&lt;/a&gt; The Yemeni have no hours and they come early morning, they can come at 10 at night and the Yemeni, they are very hospitable. When you visit someone, they all time serves tea or cake or they quickly gives you something to eat. So I was doing the same, I will offer tea and cookies. And so they will stay for hours and hours and we have the children with us, so we wanted the children to go to bed. So we have to do some kind of trick so people will not come at certain hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012001&quot; id=&quot;012001&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:20:01)&lt;/a&gt; You were a newcomer to many of the places that you worked. What were the challenges of doing your work as an outsider to those communities and what were the advantages?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012012&quot; id=&quot;012012&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:20:12)&lt;/a&gt; Let's start with the advantages. The advantages was that because I was a foreigner, they consider me to be more even ended in my opinion. That if I, say for instance you have to develop your sewer, they didn't infer that my brother-in-law was a contractor making sure and that's why I was advocating that. So there was a naivety of being a foreigner, which I think is a big advantage. It seems that you are really an honest worker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012044&quot; id=&quot;012044&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:20:44)&lt;/a&gt; The disadvantage of course is that you may ignore certain things which are important either in the culture or in politics. And sometime you may say things that you don't realize you are entering a minefield or something like that. So you have to be careful about that. For instance say, you may ask question about there was a project to bring water to the slum, but I see that it has never been done. And why is it? What was the problem?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012124&quot; id=&quot;012124&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:21:24)&lt;/a&gt; And suddenly you see everybody kind of freeze because there was a big corruption problem and the Mayor is involved in it and so they cannot say anything without attacking the Mayor or something like that. So if you are aware of it, if you were aware of the local story, then you will ask the question in different way, you see. But so again, being a foreigner that way, sometime you do naive things or certain things you don't quite understand, even if you try to understand. But again, one of the big advantage is to be an honest worker, to have no... In Yemen, it was a very, very clear things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012211&quot; id=&quot;012211&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:22:11)&lt;/a&gt; One of my job that I decided was the most important job was in fact to establish, to trace new streets in the suburb of Sana'a. And the farmers who were owning the land there, like me to do it because they knew I had no idea what tribe were there, who was owner of this. I will propose something which made sense from the way to link all this piece of land with a network of transporting in Sana'a. But they knew I had absolutely no dog in the fight and they told me so. They liked it for that, there was kind of a naivety who protected me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012258&quot; id=&quot;012258&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:22:58)&lt;/a&gt; And where they will have assumed that any Yemeni doing that will have in the back of his mind saying, &quot;Well, this is good for my brother-in-law who wants that,&quot; or something like that. In this tribal society, there is always a suspicion of corruption. I mean they will not call it corruption by the way, they will call it... It's a way of defending your tribe which is normal. It's a tribal patriotism I will call it. And in a way if you are not suspected of that, it's a big advantage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012336&quot; id=&quot;012336&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:23:36)&lt;/a&gt; You had the credibility to come in and they assumed that really when you made a suggestion it was what was globally best for the whole community as opposed to someone trying to claim that credibility.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012346&quot; id=&quot;012346&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:23:46)&lt;/a&gt; Well, one thing which I think they appreciated very much is first, they see if you are working hard, a variable. And even if it's hard, you say, &quot;I'm going to trace those streets.&quot; You are there with your transits, you trace them, you are there in the full sun and you don't complain. And they appreciate enormously hard work. And then the other thing is to be interested in the country and their culture.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012419&quot; id=&quot;012419&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:24:19)&lt;/a&gt; If you learn something about the local poets, the local writers, if you have read if it's a country which has writers and things like that, then you read a translation, you know the local writer, they appreciate enormously that you make this effort. And it will give you more credit than if you were a local and of course you knew about it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012443&quot; id=&quot;012443&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:24:43)&lt;/a&gt; I imagine it's very important to show that you respect their culture and their history, so that, as opposed to coming in and saying, &quot;This is the way things have to be done. This is the way we did it where I'm from.&quot; But at the same time, not having all of the baggage and the potential for corruption and you don't have necessarily a horse in the race, you can make more fair judgements as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012508&quot; id=&quot;012508&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:25:08)&lt;/a&gt; That's right, yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012509&quot; id=&quot;012509&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:25:09)&lt;/a&gt; So you've had a really interesting career. That was really showed through your book and one of the reasons I was so excited to meet both you and Marie-Agnes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012519&quot; id=&quot;012519&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:25:19)&lt;/a&gt; If you wanted to give advice to a young urbanist who wanted to lead a career like yours, though of course not following perfectly in your footsteps but sort of paving their own path, what three cities would you suggest they live in? Imagine they have a year and they're going to live in each city for four months each. What are the three cities that you would send them to?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012542&quot; id=&quot;012542&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:25:42)&lt;/a&gt; Well, it's a difficult question. Because again we did most of our career in Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia and a little Latin America and a little US. But things are different now. The real dynamism is still in Asia I think. And but it's in Africa. And Africa, I must say I avoided it except South Africa. But I avoided it because I thought again there was not much urban tradition and I felt the few contact I had when I was surprised to go there, that the corruption was so high that it was beyond my ability to solve problem there. And so I avoided Africa.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012634&quot; id=&quot;012634&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:26:34)&lt;/a&gt; But I think now, you cannot avoid Africa, you have to move. I think it has done a lot of progress too. Africa, in the seventies or eighties were still in the decolonization period. And by the way, being also a member of a nation which was a colonial power, was I think in Africa was a liability. I told so to my colleague in the World Bank when sometime because I spoke French, they wanted me to go to Africa. And I said they had French there for 50 or 100 years, they would like to see somebody else. And I think it's a little unfair.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012724&quot; id=&quot;012724&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:27:24)&lt;/a&gt; This is a World Bank, it's international. They have so many already french assistance that they get to another French, whatever, exactly the same idea. Because it's true. The French and their colonies, contrary to the British, wanted really to establish a French Republic there. So everything was imitated; the French administrative structure, department prefet, all the administrative. Where the British, there was somebody on top but then they were more using the local structure for instance to collect taxes. They use for instance in India, they use the local structure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012813&quot; id=&quot;012813&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:28:13)&lt;/a&gt; Whereas the French will create a little France there. You see it even in the cities. If you go to Vietnam, you go to Hanoi, you see the main Plaza of Hanoi is exactly like a little French town, with the post office, the church and city hall on the street side. And then the opera, a little next thing. So that's why I thought that it was not a good idea for me to go in a former French colony in spite of my beginning in Algeria.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012849&quot; id=&quot;012849&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:28:49)&lt;/a&gt; I see. You felt like the advice that you would give would not be very interesting to the city because they would already know.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012856&quot; id=&quot;012856&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:28:56)&lt;/a&gt; Oh yeah, no. Myself, I think I was... Let's say I had traveled enough not to impose the French model. In a way, in Algeria, in my book I explained why I thought for instance using the French law in Algeria was a big mistake and I tried not to do it. But the perception is very important. As I told you, in Yemen this perception that I was a naive, uninformed foreigner was very good when dealing with land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But if the perception was that... In Yemen, it would have been an agent of Nasser or maybe the British Intelligence Service, they were a friend of the Brits. It will have really put me in jeopardy. Or let's say not dangerous, but it would have been a lack of confidence. Saying, well he is saying that because of this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#012954&quot; id=&quot;012954&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:29:54)&lt;/a&gt; I see. So who you are really matters for your ability to get the job done effectively. It almost doesn't matter how smart you are in some cases.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013002&quot; id=&quot;013002&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:30:02)&lt;/a&gt; Well you see, there was this example when I start working for the City Planning Commission, so that was in '68, '69, in a way it was a time of the Black Panthers. There were riots. And the city wanted to do something in in Harlem, and they asked me to take charge of the project because my French accent will put me... When I worked with the black community there, my French accent was such that they couldn't locate me. They had already put people in boxes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pull-quote medium-wrap-pull-right&quot;&gt;&quot;When I worked with the black community in Harlem, my French accent was such that they couldn't locate me... Because I was a foreigner, in a way that was an advantage. Again, the naivete—they knew I had no axe to grind.&quot; — Alain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013040&quot; id=&quot;013040&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:30:40)&lt;/a&gt; White people in a white liberals, for instance they were in a box. And then they were the white racists were in another box. And in a way here I was really a foreigner and in a way they liked it. I didn't get the type of crap that my white colleague would get when they were trying to deal with the black community there at the time. Because I was a foreigner in a way was an advantage. Again, the naivete, I had no axe to grind in a way. I think being a foreigner sometime is a big advantage, if you work with empathy, if you are not arrogant if you never talk about your own country as a model.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013129&quot; id=&quot;013129&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:31:29)&lt;/a&gt; Even if you think that your country sometime is doing good things in certain area, I think you should never mention it as your country usually. Maybe use a idea but not... And then they say an implication of arrogance. And that's completely destroy the advice you will give that you are imposing, you think you are superior. Arrogance means that you are not looking at their own problem, you are already projecting what you know from outside and say this is what should be done. And so you lose credibility.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013207&quot; id=&quot;013207&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:32:07)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, that really mirrors my experience in the work that I do with open source software communities, where I am a software developer and I've contributed to some open source projects, but I don't have deep roots in any particular project.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013221&quot; id=&quot;013221&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:32:21)&lt;/a&gt; And so now that I'm building tools for open source developers of all sorts, I think it's been very helpful for people to not see me as, &quot;Oh, she's just from Linux,&quot; or &quot;She's just from the JavaScript world.&quot; But at the same time, because I don't know specifics from these communities, I go in, I try to understand the nuances of how different groups work as opposed to me saying this is the right way to do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013247&quot; id=&quot;013247&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:32:47)&lt;/a&gt; That's right. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly, very similar problem. Yes, yes. Yeah. Impartiality is very important when you give advice. And the appearance of impartiality, even if you are impartial but you have people suspect that maybe you may not be, then it destroy your credibility. And again, this ability to reason and communicate and convince. You have to convince people and so to convince people you have to have credibility.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013314&quot; id=&quot;013314&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:33:14)&lt;/a&gt; Absolutely. Okay. So if you have to pick three, it sounds like you would pick one in Africa, one in Asia. Which specific ones would you pick and what would be the third?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013325&quot; id=&quot;013325&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:33:25)&lt;/a&gt; I will pick a city like Lagos which mesmerized me. Although I've never been there, but I look at it on Google and it's an amazing place. It's a complete mess in a certain way from the outside, but it's still work. And Lagos, in Nigeria. Lagos. Yeah, yeah. In Nigeria. The problem also is government. For instance, a city like Cairo is fantastically interesting, but I will not... The form of government right now, I don't think you can do anything. I had this theory before that if you are a planner, you can always... Planning a city is such a human thing that even the dictator, you could convince a dictator to do the right thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013424&quot; id=&quot;013424&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:34:24)&lt;/a&gt; And our experience in Haiti at the time of Duvalier convinced me that I was wrong on that. There is a cutoff. If a regime is so dictatorial and such a bad dictatorship, you have to avoid working there because you will lose your time. You may learn something by the way, by working in a dictatorship, but you will not be able to do anything useful and you may even compromise yourself. So I will put Egypt in this. In Nigeria, there's a lot of corruption I understand, but it's a big mess. So if it's a big mess, I think it's all right in a certain way, you can work. If it's not true, where you have a dictator really control everything. Like I think it's a case now in Egypt. It was not the case in the time of Mubarek. I think you could still do something in the time of Mubarek. But now it's Sisi, I think.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013532&quot; id=&quot;013532&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:35:32)&lt;/a&gt; The way I see it, I will not advise to work there. But again here, the situation is in a way we were very lucky to be born the years, at two years interval when we were born, because we were a first a generation. We were just before the baby boomer. We were six years before the baby boomers, so our generation was empty. It was in terms of Europe or even in a certain way the United States, but it's in Europe. We were an empty generation. We were few of us because... And then it was a time of decolonization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013614&quot; id=&quot;013614&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:36:14)&lt;/a&gt; So that's why all these countries were desperate to have some kind of expertise coming. And even if we were relatively inexperienced like when I went to Yemen, you had more responsibility that you would have otherwise. When I was in Yemen... Yeah, I was 30-years-old. A young guy of 30-years-old will never have the job I had in Yemen now. Where Yemen is a special case. But say in another Arab country you will be very junior assistant of somebody.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013654&quot; id=&quot;013654&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:36:54)&lt;/a&gt; And so we were very, very lucky. And we also lucky to be able... We could travel that way because of that, because of this expertise we had in a decolonizing world. So people were ready to employ us without question.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013715&quot; id=&quot;013715&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:37:15)&lt;/a&gt; Right. Those demographic shifts, the demographic trends make a really big difference in what opportunities are available.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013722&quot; id=&quot;013722&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:37:22)&lt;/a&gt; And the political situation. The history of the world is changing, has changed. Colonization was a big, 19th century and just until the mid 20th century was a big thing, and decolonization was... Now this is over, the whole country's been free for a long time. So they have developed their own expertise. And so it's a different situation. So again, I am not so sure in what... As you say, it's not to just duplicate our career, it can never be done.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013803&quot; id=&quot;013803&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:38:03)&lt;/a&gt; But we have to realize that we are in a very specific period. We live in a specific period and things are different. So, but I still think that for anybody interested in cities, living in many different cities is very important. I take again the simile of the doctor. You will not want to see a doctor who has seen only one patient in his whole life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013835&quot; id=&quot;013835&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:38:35)&lt;/a&gt; And so I think to be able, and to live... You see what is also important I think is to be in a city, not to do a study in a city. I mean you always learn something if you do a study, but to be in an executive position. To be the assistant of the chief planner or to be the planner or something where you have to take decision every day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013905&quot; id=&quot;013905&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:39:05)&lt;/a&gt; It's very different from saying, &quot;Well, I'm doing a study and I would like to get your data.&quot; And you talk with the planners, you talk to them. And you may spend six months there, you may know the city pretty well, have friends there and that's nice. But you have to be in a position where you have to take decision, where you are really part of a local administration.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#013934&quot; id=&quot;013934&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:39:34)&lt;/a&gt; And this we had the luck to be in this position. When we were in Thailand, in Bangkok, we were working for the Housing Authority, which was purely Thai operation. We were the only two foreigners there. They were about 4,000 employees. But we were there not doing a study, we had a job there inside that. My job was to select a new land for low cost housing in Bangkok and to inference a policy of the Housing Authority. So this is what's important, other than to come and say, &quot;I'm doing a study, could you give me your data?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014017&quot; id=&quot;014017&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:40:17)&lt;/a&gt; Yeah. The fastest way to learn is to have some responsibility, to have to actually answer a question and take action because it really sharpens your focus and helps you understand what you're trying to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014029&quot; id=&quot;014029&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Alain (01:40:29)&lt;/a&gt; And you see how decision are taken. You see the constraint.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014036&quot; id=&quot;014036&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:40:36)&lt;/a&gt; Thanks so much for tuning in to our first episode. You can find a link to the transcript and photos in the description. The next episode will focus on the Bertaud's experience as parents and how raising children shaped how they saw the city. Thank you to the hundreds of helpful people on Twitter who offered feedback for this first episode.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014056&quot; id=&quot;014056&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:40:56)&lt;/a&gt; I especially want to thank Michael Kleyn for volunteering his audio engineering expertise and to my friend Wheezy for the kick ass intro music. Special thanks also to Scott Hanselman, Daniel Compton, and Sonal Chokshi who helped me learn the basics of podcasting. If I make any mistakes, it's because I didn't listen to them closely enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#014119&quot; id=&quot;014119&quot; class=&quot;transcript-timestamp&quot;&gt;Devon (01:41:19)&lt;/a&gt; And thanks to Market Urbanism for offering to financially sponsor the podcast. It was incredible to see how much unsolicited help we got just from sharing what we were doing on the internet. I'm continually surprised by how learning in public is always even better than I expect. See you next time.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The purpose of this writeup was to summarize something interesting I learned recently, to make sure I understood it. I figured others might find it interesting, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Digital signal processing corrects for errors better than its analog counterpart. This is one of the reasons why modern electronics are always digital.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Concretely, let's say you have a digital component that expects either 0V or 10V, and it outputs the same value it received as input.* In practice, we live in a noisy world, so the input it receives may not be exactly 0V or 10V. If the digital component receives an 8V input, it'll correct that error by &quot;rounding up&quot; and out 10V. Similarly, if the digital component receives a 3V input, it'll round down to 0V. It does not propagate the error but rather improves it before handing off its output as input to the next component. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another way to put it: digital components are resilient to minor errors coming in, and then they take that signal and construct the result within a more strict range. The outgoing result has less error than the incoming signal. The error bars of the input are bigger than the error bars of the output.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By contrast, analog inputs cannot do such a correction on a range, because they work by giving a continuous range of values rather than discrete values. This means that you cannot &quot;round up&quot; to the nearest accepted value, because all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/real-numbers.html&quot;&gt;reals&lt;/a&gt; are accepted! Thus, as you chain analog inputs and outputs, you lose fidelity at every step, because you cannot correct for errors with confidence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;* You can think of this as the &quot;identity component&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Thanks to Sebastián for originally explaining this to me and then reviewing this writeup. 🙂 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm starting a new podcast called &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Order Without Design&lt;/span&gt; with the most interesting couple I know: Alain &amp; Marie-Agnes Bertaud.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This project is an extension of their book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2I3t0q0&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities&lt;/a&gt;. With its focus on economic theory, you might not realize that this book is the product of the adventurous life these two have shared together. This podcast series is my excuse to hear and share those stories.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Join the three of us on a journey to the Bertauds' past lives in Bangkok, NYC, San Salvador, Algiers, and beyond! We'll explore the incredible stories that informed the theories in the book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We'll be publishing the first few episodes in the coming weeks. Subscribe to this feed now to get the first full episode delivered straight to your queue. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Chat soon 👋&lt;/div&gt;

Part of the future I believe I'm seeing is a change in the software ecosystem which, for the moment, I'm calling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;situated software. This is software designed in and for a particular social situation or context. This way of making software is in contrast with what I'll call the Web School (the paradigm I learned to program in), where scalability, generality, and completeness were the key virtues.
&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
I see my students cheerfully ignoring Web School practices and yet making interesting work, a fact that has given me persistent cognitive dissonance for a year, so I want to describe the pattern here, even in its nascent stages, to see if other people are seeing the same thing elsewhere.

category, with the following additional characteristic --
it is
designed for use by a specific social group, rather than for a generic

The biggest difference this creates relative to classic web applications is that it becomes easy to build &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;applications to be used by dozens of users, an absurd target population in current design practice&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. Making form-fit software for a small group of users has typically been the province of banks and research labs -- because of the costs involved, Web School applications have concentrated on getting large-scale audiences. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;by privileging the value that comes with scale, Web School applications put other kinds of value, particularly social value, out of reach&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
We've been killing conversations about software with &quot;That won't scale&quot; for so long we've forgotten that scaling problems aren't inherently fatal. The N-squared problem is only a problem if N is large, and in social situations, N is usually not large. A reading group works better with 5 members than 15; a seminar works better with 15 than 25, much less 50, and so on.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
This in turn gives &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;software form-fit to a particular group a number of desirable characteristics -- it's cheaper and faster to build, has fewer issues of scalability, and likelier uptake by its target users&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. It also has several obvious downsides, including less likelihood of use outside its original environment, greater brittleness if it is later called on to handle larger groups, and a potentially shorter lifespan.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
I see my students making some of these tradeoffs, though, because the kinds of scarcities the Web School was meant to address -- the expense of adequate hardware, the rarity of programming talent, and the sparse distribution of potential users -- are no longer the constraints they once were.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Teachers on the Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
The first inkling I got that the Web School rationale might be weakening was an application written by two of my former students, Paul Berry and Keren Merimeh. In November of 2002, as a project for a class on the feeling of online spaces called Social Weather, they created an application called (alarmingly) Teachers on the Run.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Teachers on the Run was essentially HotorNot for ITP professors, to allow students to describe and rate us in advance of spring course registration. Every professor was listed in a database; students could come by anonymously and either enter a comment about a professor or cast a vote agreeing or disagreeing with an earlier comment. The descriptions were sorted in vote total order, so that a +5 description (5 more students had agreed than disagreed) was displayed higher than a +2 or a -3. And that was it -- a list of names, a list of comments, click to vote, and a simple sorting algorithm.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
They launched it on a Friday. By Saturday night, another student called me at home to tell me I'd better take a look at it. There are only 200 or so students at ITP, but Teachers on the Run had already accumulated hundreds of comments, most positive, some negative, a few potentially libelous. More importantly, though, there had been over a thousand votes in 24 hours. By Monday morning, I had students telling me they knew what was on the site, not because they'd seen it, but because it had been the only topic of conversation over the weekend.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
The curious thing to me about Teachers on the Run was that it worked where the Web School version failed. RateMyProfessors.com has been available for years, with a feature set that put the simplistic write/read/vote capabilities of Teachers on the Run to shame. Yet no one at ITP had ever bothered to use RateMyProfessors.com, though the weekend's orgy of rating and voting demonstrated untapped demand.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Despite the social energy it unleashed, I missed the importance of Teachers on the Run. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;I told myself that it had succeeded for a number of reasons that were vaguely unfair: The users knew the programmers; the names database had been populated in advance; the programmers could use the in-house mailing list to launch the application&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; rather than trying to get attention through press releases and banner ads. Most damning of all, it wouldn't scale, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;sine qua non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; of successful Web applications. DOA, QED.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Then I saw the design process my most recent class went through.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

In a class called Social Software, which I taught last fall, the students worked in small groups to design and launch software &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;to support some form of group interaction&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. To anchor the class, I required that whatever project they came up with be used by other ITP students. This first order benefits of this strategy were simple: the designers came from the same population as the users, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;could thus treat their own instincts as valid&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;; beta-testers could be recruited by walking down the hall; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;it kept people from grandiose &quot;boil the ocean&quot; attempts&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
What I hadn't anticipated was the second-order benefits. Time and again the groups came up against problems that they solved in part by taking advantage of social infrastructure or context-sensitive information that wouldn't be available to adherents of the Web School. Two strategies in particular stand out.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; The first had to do with reputation systems. One project, The
Orderer (designed by Vena Chitturi, Fa-yi Chou, Rachel Fishman, and Cindy
Yang) was for coordinating group restaurant orders, common in
late-night work sessions. The other, WeBe (Brandon Brown, Yoonjung
Kim, Olivier Massot, Megan Phalines) was a tool for coordinating
group purchases of things like chips or motors. Because money was
involved, a Web School approach would require some way of dealing with
the threat of non-payment, using things like pre-pay or escrow accounts, or formal
reputation systems.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Instead, in both projects the students decided that since all the users were part of the ITP community, they would simply make it easy to track the deadbeats, with the threat of public broadcast of their names. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;The possibility of being shamed in front of the community became part of the application design, even though the community and the putative shame were outside the framework of the application itself.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Communal Attention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
The other strategy had to do with communal attention. Two other projects, Scout (Karen Bonna, Christine Brumback, Dennis Crowley, Alex Rainert) and CoDeck (Mark Argo, Dan Melinger, Shawn Van Every, Ahmi Wolf) ended up being situated in the community in a more literal fashion. Scout indicates physical presence, by allowing students to register themselves as being present somewhere on the ITP floor, and displaying that information. CoDeck is a community-based video server, designed to allow video artists to share and comment on each other's work.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Both groups had the classic problem of notification -- getting a user to tune in requires interrupting their current activity, not something users have been known to relish. Billions were spent on Web School applications that assumed users would bookmark for a return visit, or would happily accept email alerts, but despite a few well-publicized successes like Schwab.com and eBay, users have mostly refused to &quot;check back often.&quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Both Scout and CoDeck hit on the same solution: take most of the interface off the PC's dislocated screen, and move it into a physical object in the lounge, the meeting place/dining room/foosball emporium in the center of the ITP floor. Scout and CoDeck each built kiosks in the lounge with physical interfaces in lieu of keyboard/mouse interaction. Scout used a bar code reader to swipe in; CoDeck gutted a mid-70's BetaMax chassis and put a Linux machine inside, then used the BetaMax buttons to let the user control the video stream. Both Scout and CoDeck have web sites where users can enter or retrieve data, but the core piece of each is location in physical space that puts the application in a social context.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
These projects all took the course's original dictum -- the application must be useful to the community -- and began to work with its corollary as well -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;the community must be useful to the application&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Group Capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
We constantly rely on the cognitive capabilities of individuals in software design -- we assume a user can associate the mouse with the cursor, or that icons will be informative. We rarely rely on the cognitive capabilities of groups, however, though we rely on those capabilities in the real world all the time.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
In brainstorming sessions, a group can generate not just more ideas but more kinds of ideas than the same individuals working in isolation, and a group consensus is often more accurate than the guess of the group's most knowledgeable individual. Groups also know a lot about themselves. People in work groups know who to go to for design advice, or who is unreliable in a pinch, without any formal designation of those roles. Members of social groups know who it's fun to go drinking with or who you shouldn't lend money to (often the same person) without needing that knowledge to be spelled out in a FAQ.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Web School software ignores this kind of knowledge, because it is hard to make explicit. On most large mailing lists, for example, only a handful of posters start discussions, while most posters simply follow-up; and, at a higher level, only a handful of the members post at all, while a most simply lurk. We've known about these patterns for decades, but mailing list software still does not offer any features specific to starting vs. continuing threads, nor does it treat high-volume posters and lurkers differently.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
There is another strategy, however, analogous to asking the user to recognizing icons; the designer can simply assume the group has a certain capability, without needing to recapitulate it in code. If you have an uncollected payment in a communal buying pool, the software can kick out a message that says &quot;Deadbeat alert. Deal with it.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;A real world group will have some way of handling the problem&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;, usually through moral suasion or the threat of lost reputational capital, or even, in extreme cases, ostracism.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
This is no different than what happens in offline groups every day, but the solution feels wrong, in Web School terms, because those web applications can't assume there is a tacit reputation system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;By relying on existing social fabric, situated software is guaranteed not to work at the scale Web School apps do, but for the same reason, it can work in ways Web School software can't.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Outside Eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

I finally started regarding situated software as a practical development strategy, rather than as a degenerate case of &quot;real&quot; application development, when I invited outside reviewers into the Social Software class for a mid-term critique. These were all people who work with social software for a living, and the critique session was enormously valuable. Two of the recommendations made by the reviewers, however, struck me funny.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
The first was the suggestion, made to the CoDeck group, that they should make all the features of their video tool available over the web -- upload, download, comment, and so on. The second recommendation was an exhortation to the WeBe group that they should look at Web School group-buying sites like Mercata and MobShop as guides to their own work.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
This was the moment for me when cognitive dissonance finally became unsupportable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;Each of those comments was a) exactly what I would have said, had I been an outside reviewer in someone else's class, and b) obviously wrong, given the problem the respective groups were attacking.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

The suggestion about general web accessibility for the CoDeck interface came in the form of a rhetorical question -- &quot;Why not make it as broadly accessible as possible?&quot; In the Web School, of course, the answer is &quot;No reason&quot;, since more users are always A Good Thing, but for CoDeck there were several good reasons for not simply turning their project into a Web video app.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

Second, since CoDeck serves a tight community, the density of communication among ITP video makers would be diluted by general accessibility. Third, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;having the video deck in the lounge makes it self-policing; the cohesion of the community keeps it largely free from abuse, whereas a generally accessible and password-free &quot;upload and critique&quot; video site would become a cesspool of porn within hours&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. Finally, serving a local community maximizes use of free bandwidth on the local network, enabling features that would saddle a public system with crippling costs.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

Similarly, the recommendation that WeBe should look at Mercata and MobShop carried with it the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;assumption that the goal should eventually be to operate at large scale&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. However, Mercata and MobShop failed because they were built to scale.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Those sites required a virtuous circle, where more users meant more savings meant more users. Alas, the thought that somewhere, someone else was saving a bundle on Tupperware was never enough to attract users, and without critical mass, the virtuous circle turned vicious. Like RateMyProfessors.com, the mere existence of a Web School app wasn't enough, and having been built for tens of thousands of users, it couldn't operate for dozens or even hundreds.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
WeBe, on the other hand, was copying a small-scale pattern they first observed when a fellow student, Scott Fitzgerald, orchestrated a 30-license discount purchase of Max, the multi-media editing software. He used the ITP mailing list to recruit buyers, and then walked around the floor twisting arms and collecting checks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;This required real social fabric to work -- everyone knew and trusted Scott.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

As the instigator, Scott also benefited from the good karma -- everyone who participated saved quite a bit of money, enhancing his reputation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;Unlike actual capital, reputational capital is easier to accumulate in smaller and more closed social systems&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. The idea for WeBe came about in part because Scott said the purchase, though successful, had required too much work. Whatever the WeBe group could do to make ITP group purchases easier, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;they didn't need to build identity or reputation systems. Because the software was situated in a particular (and particularly tight) community, they got those things for free.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Old Scarcities Fade Away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Where the Web School works well, it works because it is the right kind of response to some sort of scarcity. There's scarcity of funds: Servers are expensive, not to mention load-balancing routers, tape backups, and the other accouterments of serious uptime. There's scarcity of talent: Good programmers are hard to find; great programmers are scarce as hen's teeth. And there's scarcity of use: Users are busy, they are creatures of habit, and there is significant competition for their attention.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
However, addressing these scarcities can give Web School design a kind of merry-go-round quality. You need to scale because building a useful web application is so expensive, but much of the expense comes from the requirements of scale. Furthermore, these scarcities amplify one another: You need a big hardware budget to build an application that can scale, but you need good programmers and system administrators to handle the load, whose salaries require an increased marketing budget, to attract enough users to pay for it all.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
What I think I'm seeing my students do is get off that ride. They can do this because none of the scarcities the Web School addresses are as significant as they used to be. First of all, Moore's Law and its equivalent for storage, plus the gradual improvement in operating systems, means that an $800 desktop machine can also be a pretty good server right out of the box.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Second, user attention was scarce in part because there were so few users at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;In the 90's, launching an application on the Web meant forgoing any direct connection with a particular real world community, because internet users were spread thin&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;outside the IT industry, most real world groups had only a sub-set of members who were online&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Those days are ending, and in some places they are over already. In the US today, if you are under 35 or make over 35,000 dollars a year, you are probably online, and if both of those things are true, then most of the people you know are probably online as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;You can now launch an application for a real world group, confident that all of them will have access to the internet.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;The Nature of Programming, and the Curious Case of MySQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

Finally, the practice of programming is changing. Gartner recently caused a stir by saying there would be 235,000 fewer programmers in the US ten years from now. This would have been like predicting in the 80s, that there would be fewer typists in the US by 2004. Such a prediction would be true in one sense -- the office typing pool has disappeared, and much data entry work has moved overseas. But actual typing, fingers hitting the keyboard, has not disappeared, it has spread everywhere.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
So with programming; though all the attention is going to outsourcing, there's also a lot of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;downsourcing going on, the movement of programming from a job description to a more widely practiced skill&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. If by programmer we mean &quot;people who write code&quot; instead of &quot;people who are paid to write code&quot;, the number of programmers is going to go up, way up, by 2015, even though many of the people using perl and JavaScript and Flash don't think of themselves as programmers.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
A variety of technologies are driving this -- perl, PHP, ActionScript, DHTML -- with a lot of mixing and matching and no one core tool, with one curious exception. Every application of this pattern I've seen has used a MySQL database.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
There's an analogy here with web server software. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;In the mid-90s, getting a web server running was such a messy endeavor that it was a project goal in and of itself. Then Apache came along&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;, and so simplified the process that the web server became a simple building block for larger things.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
MySQL does this for databases. This matters for the development of group applications, because the ability to sort is a public good. If Teachers on the Run had simply been a list of professors with attached comments, it would have been a write-only application, like those worthless &quot;Tell us what you think!&quot; comment forms on the bottom of news articles. One of the critical things any group wants to know is &quot;What does everyone else think?&quot;, especially if there is reason to believe that the group in aggregate knows more than any individual. Adding the 'users rate comments' system, and then pulling the data out by rating instead of time, made the system valuable.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
You can of course build these kind of features in other ways, but MySQL makes the job much easier, so much easier in fact that after MySQL, it becomes a different kind of job. There are complicated technical arguments for and against using MySQL vs. other databases, but none of those arguments matter anymore. For whatever reason, MySQL seems to be a core tool for this particular crop of new applications.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Software for Your Mom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Situated software isn't a technological strategy so much as an attitude about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;closeness of fit between software and its group of users, and a refusal to embrace scale, generality or completeness as unqualified virtues&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. Seen in this light, the obsession with personalization of Web School software is an apology for the obvious truth -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;most web applications are impersonal by design, as they are built for a generic user&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. Allowing the user to customize the interface of a Web site might make it more useful, but it doesn't make it any more personal than the ATM putting your name on the screen while it spits out your money.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Situated software, by contrast, doesn't need to be personalized -- it is personal from its inception. Teachers on the Run worked this way. Everyone knew that Paul and Keren built it. You could only rate Clay and Marianne and Tom and the other ITP professors. You didn't even know it even existed unless you were on the ITP mailing list. The application's lack of generality or completeness, in other words, communicated something -- &quot;We built this for you&quot; -- that the impersonal facade of RateMyProfessors.com doesn't have and can't fake.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
One of my students mentioned building a web application for his
mother, a schoolteacher, to keep track of her class. If you were
working alone, unpaid, and in your spare time, there's no way you
could make an application that would satisfy the general and complete needs of schoolteachers everywhere. You could make one for your mom, though.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
Small, purpose-built apps have always existed, of course -- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;learning BASIC used to be a rite of passage for PC owners&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;, and data intensive institutions like investment banks and research labs write software for small groups of users. Now, though, the combination of good tools, talented users and the internet as a social stage makes the construction of such software simpler, the quality of the result better, and the delivery to the users as simple as clicking a link. The design center of a dozen users, so hard to serve in the past, may become normal practice.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;
So what happens next? If what I'm seeing is not transitory or limited to a narrow set of situations, then we'll see a rise in these small &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;form-fit applications&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;. This will carry some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;obvious downsides, including tying the developers of such applications to community support roles, and shortening the useful lifespan of the software&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; made in this way.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;

Once it's cheap and easy to throw together an application, though, that rationale weakens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;Businesses routinely ask teams of well-paid people to put hundreds of hours of work creating a single PowerPoint deck that will be looked at in a single meeting&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;.

Indeed, as a matter of effect, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; cursor: pointer; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation start &lt;/span&gt;most software built for large numbers of users or designed to last indefinitely fails at both goals anyway.&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; position: absolute; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); overflow: hidden; font-size: 12pt; background-color: rgb(255, 210, 181); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; annotation end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; Situated software is a way of saying &quot;Most software gets only a few users for a short period; why not take advantage of designing with that in mind?&quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt; This, strangely, is a kind of progress, not because situated
software will replace other kinds of applications, but because it
mostly won't. For all the value we get out of the current software
ecosystem, it doesn't include getting an application built for
a handful of users to use for a few months. Now, though, I think we're
starting to see a new software niche, where communities get form-fit
tools for very particular needs, tools that fail most previous test of
design quality or success, but which nevertheless function well,
because they are so well situated in the community that uses them.

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The book that etched the deepest grooves in my mind last year was &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2u4MnIw&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Against the Grain&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott. It explores how the unique characteristics of grain-based agriculture shaped &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;the early history of states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;While I did learn many interesting historical facts and trends from the book, what stood out to me most was Scott's emphasis on epistemics. When he pointed to the archaeological record, he wouldn't simply cherrypick a basket of facts that supported his arguments. Instead he explained how archaeological evidence is gathered, and where that leaves systematic holes in our knowledge. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;For example, he pointed out that what we envision when we think of archaeology is really just the archaeology of states, cities, and monuments, rather than of nomadic or indigenous peoples, because those are the sites that are lowest-hanging fruit for archaeologists to find:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&quot;That states would have come to dominate the archaeological and historical record is no mystery... A great deal of archaeology and history throughout the world is state-sponsored and often amounts to a narcissistic exercise in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165); color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;-evernote-highlight:true;&quot;&gt;self-portraiture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;. Compounding this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165); color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;-evernote-highlight:true;&quot;&gt;institutional bias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; is the archaeological tradition [...] of excavation and analysis of major historical ruins. Thus if you built, monumentally, in stone and left your debris conveniently in a single place, you were likely to be &quot;discovered&quot; and dominate the pages of history. If, on the other hands, you built with wood, bamboo, or reeds, you were much less likely to appear in the archaeological record. And if your were hunter-gatherers or nomads, however numerous, spreading your biodegrade able trash thinly across the landscape, you were likely to vanish entirely from the archaeological record.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;The entire framing of archaeology as an exercise in epistemics was new to me &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;and immensely thought-provoking. &lt;/span&gt;He then pointed out that &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;the state has dominated only the last 0.2% of our species' political life&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;, despite the standard archaeological lens focusing on states&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;. T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;his stark numerical contrast blew my mind, comparing the dominance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;in my own mind &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;of monumental archaeology—the Parthenons, the Pyramids, the Machu Picchus of the world—to the shrinkingly small sliver of human history they represent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Overall the book did a fantastic job of helping me, a complete newcomer to archaeology, build mental models about the discipline. Most books I've read about early history are just a monotone timeline of facts of events, without much theory tying them together, let alone the meta work of explaining how they got to their conclusions so that the reader can judge the historian's intellectual path for themselves. For example, Scott writes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&quot;History records no cassava states, no sago, yam, taro, plantain, bread fruit, or sweet potato states...only grains are best suited to concentrated production, tax assessment, appropriation, cadastral surveys, storage, and rationing.&quot; I adore how he dives into the actual dynamics of the system whose history he's writing about, and explaining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding&quot;&gt;&quot;gears&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt; of change. That's sadly rare in all writing, not just history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I've historically found it difficult to care about or appreciate history that goes sufficiently far back. The greater the distance grows between modern day and the time I'm reading about, the harder tends to be for me to continue paying attention. I'm excited to say that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Against the Grain &lt;/span&gt;shattered this correlation. And not only is it a massive outlier, but I can't stop thinking about the topics explored in the book, and it's made me eager to read more books about the deep past—so long as they help me build mental models, rather than simply offering a monotone timeline of facts and events.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Here are some notes and quotes that particularly stood out to me from each chapter of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2u4MnIw&quot;&gt;Against the Grain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This isn't a summary of the book. It's mostly for my future self to refer back to (and thus probably missing a lot for someone who hasn't read it), but the tidbits are so interesting that I figured I'd share it nonetheless in case it's remotely helpful to someone else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;You can read my more coherent review of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/book-review-against-the-grain-by-james-c-scott&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They were said to have &quot;entered the map&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Threat posted by barbarians was the single most important factor limiting the growth of the states &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;It was better to be a barbarian once there were states, so long as those states weren't too strong; pillaging was a lucrative form of hunting and foraging. &quot;The carrying capacity of barbarian ecology is enhanced by the existence of petty states.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;States served as trading posts. Because states represented such narrow agro-ecologies, they relied on products from outside, and the barbarians grew rich providing those products.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Plunder of and trade with the state made economic life on the state's margins more viable and lucrative.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;'Barbarians' are not a 'stage' of historical/evolutionary progress in which the highest stage of life is the state as taxpayer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Barbarian&quot; is best understood as a position vis-a-vis a state.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Barbarian geography is all those geographies that are unsuitable for state making (mountains, steps, forest, swamps, deserts, moors, the sea). They are best defined as the negative space around state making zones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Among the Romans, the contrast between their diet of grain compared to the Gallic diet of meat/dairy was a key marker of their claim to civilized status. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Barbarian societies can be quite hierarchical, but generally not based on inherited property.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The barbarian story is deeply subversive &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;States preceded tribes and, in fact, largely invented them as an instrument of rule&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Contemporary piracy suggests that even today, speed, mobility, and surprise can tactically prevail over quasi-sedentary container ships&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Raiding is self-liquidating. Raiders are most likely to adjust their strategy to a &quot;protection racket&quot;. In extracting a sustainable surplus from sedentary community i es and fending off external attacks to protect its base, a stable protection racket is hard to distinguish from the archaic state itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Barbarian-state relations can be seen as a contest for the right to appropriate the surplus from the sedentary grain-and-manpower module.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The larger and more navigable the river, the larger the potential polity, because these communities were dependent on trade and exchange with other ecological zones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;As technology improved and population increased, trade became more valuable. Metcalfe's law.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The peripheries of the agrarian states became valuable commercial landscapes, as sites of valuable commodities. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;You can conquer a kingdom on horseback, but to rule it you have to dismount.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Nomads require sedentary communities as depots of manpower, revenue, and trading outlets; they tend to disappear when their host collapses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Political enclosure movement&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Fiscally invisible&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There would've been periods when leaving behind the plough of a state subject to take up foraging, pastoralism, and marine collecting would've represented both a rational economic calculation as we as a bolt for freedom &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/96aa2936-e9e3-48d2-821b-d7bc8cd121de.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/bf89bb1b-bef2-4b57-9d05-d035faf0b8ae.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/6d2a4269-923c-4d8b-83a6-7f2a0dcfc903.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/221e06d3-25e5-4ca7-bc55-c52b3dae51f6.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/492db73b-1b90-4a01-8802-d440f8877270.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/f6144b15-e9cd-458a-a3b6-e40065910b2c.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/72f1b7bc-7f8b-4351-bca5-d47eeff0f61e.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/b608d228-3482-4625-b205-fd38a9d3da60.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/66173495-b018-4674-9c84-0bf60dfd0a3b.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/09c3b653-8fff-4718-baa7-c806c605c182/207ea461-3462-47c5-89a4-c23222e870d0.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Language skills are highly multi-dimensional&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Andale Mono&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id='footnote-label--1' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; font-family:monospace; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1em; color: #006699&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so while learning a language, it's important to come at it from lots of different directions. Here are some of the tricks I've used to practice Spanish that I haven't heard so many other people use. (They're likely useful for other languages too, of course.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(1) Translate past writing you've already published in English &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One fun exercise is to take something you wrote in English, translate it to Spanish, ask a friend to proofread for mistakes, and re-publish it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/zonificacion-norteamericana-vs-japonesa&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is a good way to learn domain-specific vocabulary for topics you care about. For example, I think a lot about economics, transportation, and urban planning, but these aren't topics you'll find in top 1,000 word flash card sets or a Duolingo course or most other materials meant for Spanish-language learners. Those materials have to cater to the lowest common denominator of language, teaching vocabulary that's useful to everyone, not your niche interests. By contrast, I obviously have a special interest in learning to express those concepts since I already used them in a non-Spanish context. Translating a piece of writing you yourself wrote is a good forcing function to look up those words in a contextual way. Rather than synthetically building up a list of words that come to mind, this instead is a much more organic way to learn the words you actually use.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another perk is that if you publish your translation you then are publishing content &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;to the world &lt;/span&gt;in that language you're learning. &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;It's good for the Spanish-speaking world, because they get access to content that might never otherwise be translated into Spanish.&lt;/span&gt; This is also good for you personally, because it signals that you're interested in learning that language and thus acts as a lighthouse to attract other people who are also interested in that. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(2) Start a Spanish-speaking Twitter account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've had lots of fun with my Spanish-speaking Twitter alt account, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/devon_dos&quot;&gt;@devon_dos&lt;/a&gt;. With that account, I follow Spanish language accounts and tweet almost exclusively in Spanish. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Sometimes, these tweets just quote my usual English-language tweets in my primary account and translate what I've already said directly. This is great for the same reason as my first suggestion above—your own tweets are a sort of &quot;found&quot; language, where you're practicing saying things you clearly actually want to say, since you said them already in your native tongue. You already have things you clearly want to be able to say, so you're really learning how to express yourself. One of my biggest problems with most language-learning approaches is that they decontextualize the language you're trying to learn. The result is that you often find yourself not knowing vocabulary about the things that are most important to you because they were never covered in the textbook.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Sometimes, there are topics I'm much more excited about tweeting about in Spanish than in English for some reason, so I go for that and it's fine. (It'd be interesting to look at which topics these tend to correlate too... something something Sapir-Whorf?)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Tweeting and following accounts in Spanish is another approach to the lighthouse theory of the internet. It shows people that this is something you care about and are investing your time in, so more people will come out of the woodwork. It's also so fun to see the people who follow you then crowdsource corrections for you when you make a mistake. Making mistakes is fun when you let people help you improve!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is also a great method for learning slang, for developing a sense of how people joke around in the particular country's flavor you're targeting, and for following trends. Twitter is much more akin to the kind of language you'll find on the street of a Latin American or Spanish city, compared to your blog which is generally going to be a lot more formal. It's fun to try to incorporate the language patterns of Spanish speakers you follow into your own tweets. Also the contents of your blog are limited to just whatever you could come up with; a well-seeded Twitter feed injects a lot more randomness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Also, tweeting as I along my language-learning journey has also served as a fun sort of diary for tracking what I've learned. For example, &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;I tweet/retweet things I learn about the language. It also serves as a nice archive of little tricks I've learned so I can find them again later, in case I've forgotten them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aprendí a poner un acento rápidamente en una Mac!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Option ⌥ + E, y después cualquier vocal que querés acentuar. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IUbaV4ZQZN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IUbaV4ZQZN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Devon número dos ☀️ (@devon_dos) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devon_dos/status/1175588239647707136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Finally, tweets are very un-intimidating because they're so small. So it's easy to convince yourself to just tweet once a day, or once a week, or whatever cadence you want to get just a little bit of practice every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(3) Rewatch your favorite kids movies in Spanish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My writing of this post is appropriately timed with the recent launch of Disney Plus. Because I'm already familiar with the stories in my favorite childhood movies, they're much more accessible than some artsy film might be. These are also often movies that I miss and haven't seen in a long time but won't otherwise take an evening to re-watch, so it's a good excuse to revisit your favorite movies from childhood. Disney movies are particularly good because they tend to have really high quality dubbing, with a different voice actor for each character rather than just a single voice for the whole show, which is standard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One tip: I find it's useful to have subtitles in Spanish while watching a movie with Spanish audio dubbing, because even though I understand most of what's going on in the movie, it can be challenging to parse words every once in a while.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/7ae9eacf-9a66-4555-83ae-53e563495b14/59560fa2-76df-44db-8589-f402331cb4f4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(4) Set up a quick-access translator app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One tool I've found really helpful is getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/intelligent-translator/id1217010477?mt=12&quot;&gt;Intelligent Translator&lt;/a&gt; in my Mac menu bar. It's much faster than continuously opening Google Translate tabs, dramatically reducing the friction for looking anything up. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This means that not only can you translate words you read or sentences you're trying to say but are stuck on faster, but also that it means you're more likely to look things up in the first place and try more challenging language tasks. For example, I now feel more comfortable reading tweets and articles in Spanish because I know it'll only take a moment to look up an unfamiliar word, whereas before it was more of a slog. And sometimes I have a strike if fancy where I think things like &quot;Huh I wonder how you'd say 'saffron' in Spanish&quot; or some other random concept that pops into my head, and it's just a keystroke away to fulfill that whim.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The ergonomics of the app are quite good. I have a custom hotkey to open it from any other app (&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;CMD+SHIFT+W to toggle to toggle the menu popup) and another to translate to translate my highlighted cursor selection (&lt;/span&gt;CTRL+CMD+C). It also immediately translates everything on your clipboard and displays a small preview in the menu bar, if you set it to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(5) Opt for e-books rather than physical ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I have a special place in my heart for dead-tree books, but an ebook is a godsend when learning a foreign language. It's easy to select a word or phrase and use the lookup function to quickly get a translation, compared to having to pull out a dictionary or translation app every time you get stuck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/7ae9eacf-9a66-4555-83ae-53e563495b14/af27fb37-5ba1-4415-a527-d2a9bfcda02e.jpg&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;&quot; width=&quot;2388&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(6) Subscribe to Spanish language podcasts and YouTube channels &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've had a bit of a hard time finding many good podcasts and YouTube channels in Spanish. There is lots of language learning content, but much of it runs into the same problems as textbooks, where they focus on boring topics rather than contextualized topics you actually care about. When I listen to most of these shows, my only interest in them is that they're in intermediate Spanish and thus something I'll actually have a chance of understanding, but otherwise I'm uninterested in their content. Unfortunately this means that I get bored quickly and zone out, which reduces their effectiveness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;However, podcasts and YouTube channels are a good source of practice for understand informal uses of language, which for me is more difficult to parse than more regularized, formal audio samples like audiobooks. So despite having a hard time finding great content to consume, I've been determined to keep looking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;From searching for a while, I've found a few shows that are actually quite interesting in their own right, while still being simple enough for me to follow along for the most part. Here are a few podcasts I've found, which may be more interesting for you:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://podcast.duolingo.com/spanish&quot;&gt;Duolingo Spanish Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://catastrofeultravioleta.com/&quot;&gt;Catástrofe ultravioleta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosasdeinternet.fm/&quot;&gt;Cosas de Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colectivoburbuja.org/category/burbuja-radio/colectivo-burbuja-economia-directa/&quot;&gt;Economía directa &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://entiendetumente.info/&quot;&gt;Entiende tu Mente&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripeando.org/&quot;&gt;Tripeando: Conocimiento Colectivo &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/voces-emprendedoras/id1053570654&quot;&gt;Voces Emprendedoras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And here are a few YouTube channels in Spanish I've found somewhat interesting to play in the background while I'm doing paperwork-type tasks:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/macaroneru&quot;&gt;Nekojitablog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDoWEe-N0L4&quot;&gt;Harry Potter audiobook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNycxtiBvicVeMLHDBqoRtA&quot;&gt;Me Llamo Nathan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vvyl4IIpkQ&quot;&gt;Japanistic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I wouldn't say any of these are among my favorite podcasts or channels overall, but they're interesting enough if you're looking for something in Spanish. If you have additional recommendations, please do let me know!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(7) Use spaced repetition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Spaced repetition is a useful tool for embedding vocabulary and phrases deep into your brain so it can't get dislodged. An example where this has been especially useful for me: while I already know that &quot;mucho gusto&quot; is what you'd say as a greeting when you meet someone for the first time, my retrieval is pretty slow in the moment when I actually need to say it, and in those social interactions, pacing is everything. If you don't get out the proper greeting in the right moment, you've generally lost your chance and the conversation has moved on. As a result, I've added that phrase to my spaced repetition flashcard deck so that I have it on the tip of my tongue in the moments where I need it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I also try to put every cool phrase I come across that I particularly like into spaced repetition deck. In particular, I've added lots of Argentinian idioms into my deck. That way I can deploy them in appropriate moments and surprise everyone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I must say that flashcards are my least favorite method I'm suggesting here, though they do have their uses. Flash cards decontextualize words, which as you can tell from above I'm not a huge fan of. However, they are incredibly helpful for getting key vocabulary on the tip of your tongue at the right moment, which can do wonders for increasing your reaction velocity and confidence in conversations. So I recommend flash cards less for learning new words and more for imprinting the ones you already know and simply want faster retrieval for into your mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;None of the spaced repetition apps are great, so here are a few that I've tried and are &quot;just fine&quot;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quizlet/id546473125&quot;&gt;Quizlet&lt;/a&gt; (this is the one I currently use) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/studies/id986066259&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(8) Word of the Day newsletters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To get a little injection of new vocabulary into my day, I'm subscribed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transparent.com/word-of-the-day/today/spanish.html&quot;&gt;Spanish Word of the Day newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. It blends into all my other threads pouring into my inbox, so I don't have to exercise additional self control to go look up a new word each day. This means that every day I learn at least one new word in Spanish, even if I forget or don't have time to do any other practice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(9) Change your phone's system language to Spanish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My key fluency goal is to be so comfortable in Spanish that I don't even think about the fact I'm using it. While it felt very odd to see all of my phone's menus in Spanish at first, I use my phone so frequently that it quickly faded into the background and I now have very little problem with understanding the UI. (It's also an interesting exercise in seeing which parts of the UX are intuitive on their own without labels, and which ones I'm more dependent on the labels for.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I still haven't changed my system language on my laptop, because I do far more complex tasks there and view many more different UIs, whereas the set of apps and the flexibility of the OS on my phone is more limited. Also I do actual work there, where I don't want my discomfort with the language to get in the way of getting my work done. Maybe one day I'll give it a try though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(10) Build muscle memory for typing accented characters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This isn't exactly to learn Spanish, but it makes it easier to type in Spanish: learn the hotkeys for the Spanish characters!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;ñ — Option + n, n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;á — Option + e, a&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;é — Option + e, e&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;í — Option + e, i&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;ó — Option + e, o&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;ú — Option + e, u&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;ü — Option + u, u&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;inverted question mark (¿) — Shift + Option + ?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;inverted exclamation point (¡) — Option + 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;left angle quote («) — Option + \&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;right angle quote (») — Shift + Option + \&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(11) It is fine to fill in the gaps with English and Spanglish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My instinct when I don't know a particular word in Spanish is to stop dead in my tracks and ask what the proper word is. Instead, I've learned it's more fun and practical to override that instinct and instead just power through and take my best guess. This is&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt; a great source of entertainment for everyone, and I'm constantly surprised by how frequently I hit upon the actually correct word (or at least something close to it) when I thought I was just taking a wild guess. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, yesterday I was talking about the word &quot;despegar&quot;, which means &quot;to take off&quot;, and I asked &quot;despegar como un rockete?&quot;. &quot;Rockete&quot; is not the word for rocket—the proper word would've been &quot;cohete&quot;—but it &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;could've&lt;/span&gt; been, and it was a good enough guess that my speaking partner could correct me quickly and teach me the right word. (Also apparently it was hilarious.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The general pattern I use is to first say a sentence fully with the guess word in place of the vocabulary I'm not sure of, then to make a facial expression to my conversational partner to indicate that I'm not confident of what I just said. The facial expression is shorthand for &quot;I realize the sentence I just said may be extremely confusing, so please correct me if I'm wrong... and if I said it coherently, please give me positive reinforcement so I know I can keep going.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;(12) Date an Argentinian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The single biggest piece of advice I can give is to start dating someone whose first language is Spanish. (Though I suppose this is easier said than done. 😋)  I studied Spanish in school for years, but my comprehension, verbal skills, and confidence with the language grew an order of magnitude faster as soon as I met my boyfriend, who grew up in Buenos Aires. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I learned more Spanish in the first few months we dated than in the half decade I studied it in school, including the summer I lived in Panama. Now that I'm with him, I am far more motivated, our conversations are contextual, and I feel even more comfortable than usual at being a beginner because I'm with someone I trust.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There is no greater motivation to learn a language than wanting to impress your boyfriend's parents. His &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;family lives in Argentina, and it's very important to me that I can communicate with them in their native tongue. I can't exactly explain why—they all speak English so it's not like I wouldn't be able to communicate with them at all—but it feels like an important sign of respect, and I want to be able to participate fully in their family and social life when we visit. This winter I'll be back for my second visit, and I'm really looking forward to seeing their reactions when they see how much my Spanish has improved. &lt;/span&gt;😊&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another benefit is similar to the contextual nature of the first two suggestions here—when I speak with my boyfriend in Spanish around the house, our conversations are about real things that I actually care about, rather than an artificial set of words compiled in a textbook trying to take a stab at what topics will be useful to the greatest number of people. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Also, the language I use with him is situated in space, so I can associate words in a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace&quot;&gt;memory palace&lt;/a&gt;. My language use is now grounded in the physical world as we go around daily life, instead of learning new vocabulary in a classroom, severed from the environment where they're used. For example, I re-learned the word for &quot;fork&quot;—&quot;tenedor&quot;, which I always had a hard time remember in school—while we were in the kitchen while I was holding an actual fork in my hand. This etched a much deeper pathway in my mind for that word than when I saw it on a vocabulary sheet printed out by my high school Spanish teacher. (Or at least that's how it feels... I'm not actually sure of the cognitive science here.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Finally, it's incredible what a difference it makes to learn a language with someone you deeply trust and who can simulate your speech patterns and mental models well. He understands my Spanish better than most other people, and he can simulate where I'm likely to get lost and give me some assistance. It's interesting to see how wide a range there is on this front when talking to different people. It's particularly stark between talking to native Spanish speakers who have done exchange programs abroad where they had to learn a new language, and to native Spanish speakers who don't have the personal experience of being throttled on your ability to express themself. The former group has a lot more empathy and can better predict where you might get stuck. Now that I have had more of that experience, I'd like to think that I've also improved on my ability to speak with English language learners.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:monospace; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;I drafted an essay about this a while ago but haven't gotten around to polishing and publishing it. I will link it as soon as it's up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--1').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $(&quot;#footnote-content--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-label--1').offset().top}, 200);}); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the time, it was the most widely shared take I’d ever written. I learned several things from writing this piece, and none of them had to do with Dropbox: I learned, for instance, that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;a great way to get people to click on your blog post is to make them mad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; I also learned about a company called Social Capital, after my soon-to-be-colleague Ray reached out to me about what I’d written. I’m certainly thankful I wrote it.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;Today, Dropbox is not dead. I’m glad! I certainly never &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; the business to do poorly. I used it all the time back then, continue to have friends who work there, and generally would rather not cheer for companies to fail; that’s not a great look. But I think it’s fair to say that the take didn’t turn out to be egregiously wrong. (Dropbox had last raised at a $10 billion valuation the year before, and currently trade at an 8 billion dollar market cap. So over the last five years that’s a -4% annual return, compared to the S&amp;P at around 10%. Not dead, but hardly what I think most people pictured the next 5 years to be like.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a huge bummer, for sure; and also a reminder of a hidden price we pay for modern technology. Everything is amazing, but nothing is ours.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s also why files are called files, and why we got rid of them by dragging them into the trash can. Software was pretty &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44);&quot;&gt;skeuomorphic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; in design and in function. The file as an atomic unit for productivity made sense. It’s a solid, distinct object you could understand, and that was yours. You had to take care of it, name it properly, and save it in the right place, just like a paper file.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

New technology generally reorganizes our consumption away from ownership and towards access. 100 years ago, music came from a piano, then it came from the record store, and now it comes from Spotify. 100 years ago, food came from a farm, then it came for a grocery store, and now it comes from DoorDash. There’s no denying that this is forward progress for the consumer. You would not want to go backwards. But there’s a cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;The more you can access, the less it’s yours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You just push the Uber button and somebody comes and picks you up. But it’s also not funny, because we’ve all experienced the particularly modern frustration of seeing the Uber drive in the opposite direction, spin around 4 times, then cancel.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;&quot;The other day, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;I came across a website I’d written over two decades ago. I double-clicked the file, and it opened and ran perfectly. Then I tried to run a website I’d written 18 months ago and found I couldn’t run it without firing up a web server, and when I ran NPM install, one or two of those 65,000 files had issues that meant node failed to install them and the website didn’t run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; When I did get it working, it needed a database. And then it relied on some third-party APIs and there was an issue with CORS because I hadn’t whitelisted localhost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 1.8rem; box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;My website made of files carried on, chugging along. This isn’t me saying that things were better in the old days. I’m just saying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.05em; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;years ago websites were made of files; now they are made of dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The delta in performance is irresistible, and dependencies are a compelling building block: they seem like just a piece of logic, with no cost and no friction. But they absolutely have a cost: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;the cost is complexity, outsourced agency, and brittleness. The cost of ownership is up front and visible; the cost of access is back-dated and hidden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If the world is going to get reorganized into services and dependencies, so be it; but find what’s air gapped, and find what’s ours. People are smart enough to tell what’s solid and what isn’t. Product teams who go out of their way to give us real, tangible objects we feel that we can own will find a great deal of success.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They’ve built an incredible user experience for multiplayer design software – a domain that’s been fully SaaSed – by taking &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; the excessive, &quot;everything must be live access&quot; type of dependencies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; color: rgb(195, 66, 44);&quot;&gt;in favour of simpler, stabler architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; that works fabulously and feels solid, like something you can trust. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ecosystem is having a real effect on how people think about ownership versus access, as people learn about how to store and manage their private keys, and by extension, come to realize everything that access isn’t.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But I’d love to see more teams embrace the idea that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;less friction isn’t always best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; If the current trend of technology is sweeping us in a direction of &quot;everything is amazing, but nothing is ours&quot;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt;Technology that’s Actually Yours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; line-height: 28.8px;&quot;&gt; could be the next great counter-trend. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Music enthusiasts will tell you there's nothing quite like &quot;tube sound&quot;, the warm, rich sound quality that old vacuum tube amplifiers bring to the music played through them. And they'll pay top dollar for it! Once considered obsolete, vintage vacuum tube amps now sell at a premium, because audiophiles want to reproduce the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PbJ1GZMi_ho?t=114&quot;&gt;harmonic distortions&lt;/a&gt; this old tech is so famous for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This now-beloved distortion was initially seen as a bug, not a feature. It was an unintentional byproduct of the technology used at the time, an artifact of how vacuum tubes work rather than a premeditated characteristic of the hardware design. Later, we developed transistor amps, which have a &quot;pure&quot; sound that eliminated those distortions. Only once those transistor amps came onto the scene did audiophiles begin to reminisce about &quot;tube sound&quot;. In fixing the flaws of the old paradigm, the new design brought to light that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; of those flaws—like tube sound—were actually quite enjoyable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 321px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 321px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 321px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot; color=&quot;#797979&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/43e2115c-c352-4e3e-8df1-c8d2a3b91eda/e83ca754-f3dd-4658-8662-b78034ab04bf.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Embracing these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenrockwell.com/audio/why-tubes-sound-better.htm&quot;&gt;euphonic distortions&lt;/a&gt; is a common way people relate to and embrace outdated tech. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16973914/tvs-crt-restoration-led-gaming-vintage&quot;&gt;CRT televisions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/search?q=pixel+art&quot;&gt;8-bit pixel art&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.photoancestry.com/what-is-sepia.html&quot;&gt;sepia photography&lt;/a&gt; all have enthusiasts who adore these once-ubiquitous technologies. We've now surpassed the technical limits of those old mediums, but these aficionados savor precisely the aesthetics produced those old constraints that have been &quot;solved&quot; by newer tech. They take inspiration from those aesthetics and recreate them with new technology.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;These old, flawed mediums are nostalgia machines, and that's a big part of the draw. You don't have to be a CRT television connoisseur to appreciate their distinct aesthetic. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=496507&quot;&gt;crackly flicker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tested.com/tech/gaming/456719-best-crt-retro-games/&quot;&gt;scan lines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenakedscientists.com/get-naked/experiments/magnets-and-tvs&quot;&gt;magnetic damage&lt;/a&gt; make each of these TVs a time machine, teleporting you back to an earlier era. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Euphonic distortion, in the purest sense, is a product of is time. In a way these distortions are most &quot;authentic&quot; artifacts of a given era. No one planned for them, and only after removing these random errors do we appreciate the value they added. Their lack of self-consciousness is disarming. Euphonic distortion is authentic because it's not something you'd come up with; it simply arises as a function of the technical constraints of a particular moment. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But it's not just about nostalgia. The constraints imposed by an old technology can also produce joy in their own right. For example, stick-shift cars make you feel one with the vehicle in a way an automatic transmission cannot. The extra complexity to shift gears in manual transmission cars is exactly why most American consumers abandoned them for automatic... and it's exactly what draws enthusiasts back to manual cars. What was once a function of circumstance is now a conscious choice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course this &quot;vacuum tube nostalgia&quot; is not the fate of every historical glitch. Few accidental artifacts are beloved. Many more are abandoned as fast as we come up with a better way, something that overcomes that a limitation. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in&quot;&gt;screen burn-in&lt;/a&gt; is a phenomenon of phosphorus-based monitors that happens when a specific image literally burns the inside of the screen over a prolonged period. I find it hard to imagine that anyone would want that effect. You're never going to get a burn-in filter on Instagram. It just looks dirty and gross, and makes it hard to see other images on the screen later. Most flaws go the way of burn-in. Very few are actually charming or nostalgic; most are simply worse than the new and improved ways of doing things, and we abandoned those practices for good reason.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/43e2115c-c352-4e3e-8df1-c8d2a3b91eda/58969d7c-994c-46bb-9b8f-28b7291f0873.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Burn-in just doesn't look good. We're not going to get a burn-in filter on Instagram any time soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/43e2115c-c352-4e3e-8df1-c8d2a3b91eda/9bb1b368-fe7c-4ea0-abd5-6f934c5427d0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even those few historical glitches that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; beloved work well in some contexts but not in others. While I adore the aesthetic of 8-bit pixel art, I wouldn't want to live in the world of the 1980s, when digital artists were so constrained in their expression. The inflexibility of their medium gave rise to a beautiful, distinctive art style, but it also inhibited the range of aesthetic experiences they could create.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 309px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/43e2115c-c352-4e3e-8df1-c8d2a3b91eda/347ee3cd-1f39-458f-814b-9d6fe33efef6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;110&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 309px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/43e2115c-c352-4e3e-8df1-c8d2a3b91eda/f102c21c-198a-45a5-9057-e21b5d90a8c4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;144&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;As much as I love 8-bit art, I'm glad digital artists like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/danluvisiart/gallery&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dan Luvis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;i are no longer constrained by a narrow pixel palette for all of their work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can have the best of both worlds: digital artists now have a far more varied palette to choose from as they create art, but they can also go back to the old constraints of pixel art when seeking that particular style. Their toolset is all the richer for having gone through a period of arbitrary, unintended technical constraints, because 8-bit art is a style they may not have realized was possible or desirable if they hadn't at one point had the constraints. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;1 – There's now a thriving market for this obsolete amplifier technology, for the precise reasons that once made it outdated and uncompetitive. These amps are pricey, especially original vintage ones. If you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on your own tube amp, you can add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkbass.com/threads/whats-the-best-fake-tube-amp.1089320/page-6&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;artificial distortions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;through a special feature of many modern amps or in the post-processing step of an audio-editing tool. Many modern songs use this aesthetic in intros or as a trick to set the scene and set a particular aesthetic and time, and even recording studios that work in an all-digital medium use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-much-gear-so-little-time/750361-best-tube-mic-pre.html&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;tube pre-amplifiers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;inside of microphones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121);&quot;&gt;2 – I'm not an expert on any of this! Most of what I know here is from conversations with old musician friends and casual research. Please correct/add to this if you know more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

KATG  talk about the iPod on the show 194 (around 4 minutes). I disagree with them that the iPod is bad  mine is 3 months old. It's iTunes (6.0.1.3) that sucks.

So I followed the link marked &quot;lenses&quot; on the basis that overloading a term like lens would be about improving clarity, focus, access to normally inaccessible information.  It led to something called squidoo which contained mock web pages, AFAICS. What is it about? Were it not mentioned here, I'd now dismiss it as pointless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's not the lack of complexity that makes it inadequate for programming, but that it can give no direction to the beginner. All the reward of Notepad is for the experienced user. To the beginner with no experience it gives nothing back. Notepad is already located towards the top end of the curve in their case, but for the new bod just stepping into say, web programming, Notepad is right down at the bottom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The pre-modern state was, in many crucial respects, particularly blind; it knew precious little about its subjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields, their location, their very identity. It lacked anything like a detailed &quot;map&quot; of its terrain and its people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The state is not actually interested in the rich functional structure and complex behavior of the very organic entities that it governs (and indeed, is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;part &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;of, rather than &quot;above&quot;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;It merely views them as resources that must be organized in order to yield optimal returns according to a centralized, narrow, and strictly utilitarian logic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt; The attempt to maximize returns need not arise from the grasping greed of a predatory state.

The early modern state, Germany in this case, was only interested in maximizing tax revenues from forestry. This meant that the acreage, yield and market value of a forest had to be measured, and only these &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;obviously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;relevant variables were comprehended by the statist mental model. Traditional wild and unruly forests were literally illegible to the state surveyor’s eyes, and this gave birth to &quot;scientific&quot; forestry: the gradual transformation of forests with a rich diversity of species growing wildly and randomly into orderly stands of the highest-yielding varieties. The resulting catastrophes — better recognized these days as the problems of monoculture — were inevitable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Johnson tells the researcher that perhaps they should start by examining his brain’s baseline reaction to meaningless stimuli. He naively suggests a white-noise pattern as the right starter image. The researcher patiently informs him that subjects’ brains tend to go crazy when a white noise (high Shannon entropy) pattern is presented. The brain goes nuts trying to find order in the chaos. Instead, the researcher says, they usually start with something like a black-and-white checkerboard pattern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One of my favorite unexpected examples from the book is the &quot;rationalization&quot; of people names in the Philippines under Spanish rule (I won’t spoil it for you; read the book).

In some of the more redeeming examples, there is merely a shift in a balance of power between more global and more local interests. For example, we owe to this high-modernist formula the creation of a systematic, global scheme for measuring time, with sensible time zones. The bewilderingly illegible geography of time in the 18th century, while it served a lot of local purposes very well (and much better than even the best atomic clocks of today), would have made modern global infrastructure, ranging from the railroads (the original driver for temporal discipline in the United States) to airlines and the Internet, impossible. The Napoleanic era saw the spread of the metric system; again an idea that is highly rational from a centralized bird’s eye view, but often stupid with respect to the subtle local adaptions of  the systems it displaced. Again this displaced a good deal of local power and value, and created many injustices and local irrationalities, but the shift brought with it the benefits of improved communication and wide-area commerce.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But that would be missing the point. The reason the formula is generally dangerous, and a  formula for failure, is that it does not operate by a thoughtful consideration of local/global tradeoffs, but through the imposition of a singular view as &quot;best for all&quot; in a pseudo-scientific sense. The high-modernist reformer does not acknowledge (and often genuinely does not understand) that he/she is engineering a shift in optima and power, with costs as well as benefits. Instead, the process is driven by a naive &quot;best for everybody&quot; paternalism, that genuinely intends to improve the lives of the people it affects. The high-modernist reformer is driven by a naive-scientific Utopian vision that does not tolerate dissent, because it believes it is dealing in scientific truths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A generation of planners, inspired by the crazed visions of Le Corbusier, created unlivable urban infrastructure around the world, from Braslia to Chandigarh. These cities end up with deserted empty centers populated only by the government workers forced to live there in misery (there is even a condition known as &quot;Brasilitis&quot; apparently), with slums and shanty towns emerging on the periphery of the planned center; ad hoc, bottom-up, re-humanizing damage control as it were. The book summarizes a very elegant critique of this approach to urban planning, and the true richness of what it displaces, due to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(65, 66, 84);&quot;&gt;Jane Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(65, 66, 84); font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, Palatino, serif; line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The midnight second steak might be more the glamorous one, standing as it does a good three inches off the plate, but all it has to do is get you up and out of the restaurant and into bed (for the love of God, don't forget to drink water).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Misorder the first steak and you will either find yourself losing steam by eight o'clock, when no restaurant is open, or scampering to find an awkward third bridge steak, to tide you over until dinner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;All you need to know about the quality of pasture in the pampas is that cows  went feral in Argentina.    You can still see them grazing pretty much anywhere there is a horizontal patch of grass, all now firmly back in the hand of man, but still with a happy grassy glint in their eye.   This most docile, placid, and passive of large herbivores stepped off the boat, took one nibble at the pampas  and made a run for it.  It knew that it wanted to spend the rest of its life eating the pampas grass, without outside interference.   And the settlers, once they caught some of the early escapees, began to feel the same way about the beef. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;

You find yourself leaning on friends to come visit, and writing YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND in all caps  more often than feels comfortable.   Argentine beef really is extraordinary.   Almost all of this has to do with how the cows are raised.  There are no factory feedlots in Argentina; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;the animals still eat pampas grass their whole lives, in open pasture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;, and not  the chicken droppings and feathers mixed with corn that pass for animal feed in the United States.  Since this is the way of life a cow was  designed for, it is not necessary to pump the animal full of antibiotics.  The meat is leaner, healthier and more flavorful than that of corn-fed cattle.  It has fewer calories, contains less cholesterol, and tastes less mushy and waterlogged than American meat.   And the cows spend their lives out grazing in the field, not locked into some small pen.   You can taste the joy.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;When the meat is cooked, it is roasted in thick pieces over open coals by obsessive meat chefs who have been cooking meat all their lives, for other people who have been eating meat all their lives, in a country that takes its meat extremely seriously.   You are not likely to be disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;Steaks here are ridiculous - not so much in diameter, since they rarely overhang the plate by more than an inch or two - but in thickness, having roughly the proportions of an American canned ham.   But what the Argentines have really mastered is flavor.  Strange cuts of meat that would be ground into flavorless paste up north come to your table here infused with a delicious texture and flavor, provided they are cooked right.  And they are invariably cooked right.    The waiters are solicitous about asking (in English) how you want your meat done, but if you let them make the call, you get a two-inch thick of meat that transitions seamlessly from carbon to bright pink and back.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However the basic principles are simple.  Meat is prepared in two ways, either on a parrilla (charcoal grill) or an asador (a system of iron crucifixes circling an open fire).   The crucifix shape is suggestive and amusing.  An excellent essay on Argentine history by Martín Caparrós may give a clue to its origin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 249); padding: 12px 22px; margin: 20px 40px 20px 10px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 102); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 180%;&quot;&gt;
Juan Díaz de Solís, a Sevillian and a gentleman, arrived in the Freshwater Sea in February of 1516, when none of this existed yet.  He voyaged in three ships, as is fitting, and when some shameless natives made him a signal of welcome, he readily leaped onto the shore with his cross and his sword, only to land without further ceremony on the coals of a banquet: he was to be the main course.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 102); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 180%;&quot;&gt;His companions, who watched him slowly tranformed into a dish from the boat, then told the world of those who bury their dead that Argentine history had begun as an asado of their captain, skin and all.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;Surely Solís was wearing one of those crucifixes that shows Jesus actually hanging from the cross.   It must have been a simple mistake on the part of the natives, who saw him as a friendly gift from the visitors on the boat, complete with a serving suggestion suspended around his neck.   In any case, you will now see crucified lambs and calves in the front window of many a larger parrilla, roasting for hours in front of unfazed diners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Argentine steak stands alone, towering three inches over the plate, its edges  hanging delectably over the sides of its silver platter.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;Daytime steaks may be more coy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;  While the parsley sprig as garnish is unknown in Argentina, you will sometimes encounter a fried egg, an olive, or a strip of pickled red pepper, sometimes even a combination of all three:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;

An American who didn't know better might greet the lomito as an old dinnertime friend - the choice sirloin - but it bears about as much resemblance to a full Argentine steak as a rubber duck does to a battleship.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;Steaks come with a condiment called chimichurri, which is intermediate on the condiment spectrum between salsa and Worcestershire sauce, and can appear in any viscosity from liquid to little diced cubes.  Chimichurri is made from garlic, hot peppers, oregano, parsley and vinegar, in varying proportions.  Some of the best I've had resembles pesto, with barely any hot pepper and thick bergs of garlic; other chimichurri is much spicier and red in color.  It is there to help you - something about the sauce helps the steak go down without fuss - and you should let it do its job.  The same goes for Argentine wine; it is excellent and designed to get you safely through the large portions of beef.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;There is a darker side, too, to Argentine condiments, and it is called salsa golf, the unholy alliance of ketchup and mayonnaise.  This will sneak up on you when you least expect it, including in eight-star restaurants and the most delicate of seafood dishes.  Any trip to an Argentine supermarket should give you fair warning: you can find yogurt, for example, in little containers ranging up to about 200 mL in size, but mayonnaise is sold in foil bags (bags!) of up to two liters in size. These are great fun to drop off your balcony.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Steak is a staple food here, and you don't have to contend with Peter Lugar-style snobbishness.   You are dealing with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;food of the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;   Argentina is number one in world beef consumption, weighing in at 65 kilograms (about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;twelve steaks) per person per year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;, half again as much as Americans (!) eat.

For most people in Argentina, a vegetarian is something you eat.  One's diet will accordingly lean heavily on pastas, gnocchi, salads, and (for the less squeamish ) fish.  Vegans will not survive in Argentina.  However, even egg, milk and cheese-loving vegetarians should be careful not to get cocky.  Two vegetarians have visited me here during my stay, and from both I had to listen to many glowing words about the quality of Argentine fries, unable due to my impeccable upbringing to ask what they thought it was that made the fries taste so wonderful, or why they looked so deliciously yellow.  On even the most innocent box of crackers, in the slot where you would normally expect to find &quot;partially hydrogenated vegetable oil&quot;, it reads simpy &quot;beef tallow&quot;.   The homemade cookies bought in the minimarket downstairs taste of steak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;

The milk comes in plastic bags that would give any American marketing department a heart attack.  They proudly advertise &quot;GUARANTEED 100% BRUCELLOSIS AND HOOF-AND-MOUTH FREE&quot;.  One brand even brags that its bacteria count *never* exceeds 100,000 per mL, and prints daily statistics to prove it (only 82,000 bacteria/mL on Monday! mmm!).    Meanwhile, the butter here either has a different name than in the rest of Latin America (&quot;manteca&quot; usually means &quot;lard&quot; ), or else Argentine lard is the best I have ever tasted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Worst and most puzzling in a country settled by Italians is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;horrible ground coffee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;   Most cafés and restaurants serve  good espresso, but you are in the wilderness as soon as you try to find something you can brew at home.  The idea of purchasing beans to grind seems to be a great novelty - it took several days of hunting to find both a grinder and something to put in it.  Grocery store coffee is inevitably sold pre-ground and roasted with sugar, giving it a dark color and the taste and aroma of burnt socks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Every pharmacy has an aisle devoted to artificial sweeteners, for those who must do without, and there is a general inability to imagine a dessert that does not make your teeth hurt.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;Items are preventatively glazed with sugar whenever there is be the slightest doubt as to whether they are supposed to be sweet or savory; this is what prevents the otherwise excellent Argentine croissants (medialunas) from being the king of breakfasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I am talking about dulce de leche.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;Dulce de leche is a culinary cry for help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;  It says &quot;save us, we are baffled and alone in the kitchen, we don't know what to do for dessert and we're going to  boil condensed milk and sugar together until help arrives&quot;.   This cloying dessert tar is so impossibly sweet that  you wish you were ten years old again, just so you could actually enjoy it.   It is everywhere.  There is a special dulce de leche shelf in the supermarket dairy case, and the containers go up to a liter in size.  Even the churros are stuffed with it - the churros, Montresor!   For anyone who has had pastries in Europe, the added horror is that dulce de leche is identical in color, texture and consistency to a number  of much less sweet, tasty fillings, like the   earthy chestnut material the French call crème de marrons, or the tart kind of plum butter popular in Eastern European  bakeries.   You see a thick layer of dark brown jam-like material and think, this couldn't possibly be caramel, there's just too much of it.  And so worldliness leads you to great giant bites and then disaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Liquid nitrogen ice cream (recipe: heavy cream, walnuts, liquid nitrogen, sugar.  Stir) is delicious because the ice crystals it forms are so very small; this also makes the ice cream melt very fast.

Wander into any bistro or restaurant between eleven and six and you will be served a delicious lunch-sized meal, but you are likely to be the only person there, with the waiter mopping floors in the corner and the parrilla stacked with raw meat for the midnight dinner rush.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What distinguishes mate from coffee and tea is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;social context - two or more people share a gourd, with a designated pourer in charge of refilling it with hot water after each turn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;   The ritual is low-fuss but indispensible.   You can buy mate gourds and thermoses in any grocery store, and get your thermos filled with hot water at any convenience store or gas station, but you will never see mate served in restaurants or sold in little disposable paper gourds, to go.   it's not that people refuse to drink mate alone - anyone working a solitary shift will have a gourd in hand - but that the concept of being served mate by someone who does not share it with you seems impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Things level off at 970 mL.  In my case, it means I end up drinking 1940 mL of beer as a kind of personal protest, and all is well with the world.   To make up for the abundance of sizes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; padding: 2px 0px; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; max-width: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); color: black; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;beer comes in only one variety, Quilmes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;, which inevitably comes served with a tripartite platter of snacks - nuts, salty cylinders, and aged potato chips.    On rare occasions, you may even get a four-leaf platter (olives), this is considered lucky.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;Once you have had your afternoon chopp and its accompanying beer snacks, there is nothing better in the world than switching on the television to watch one of the many cooking shows that seem to be so popular here.   You can take your pick from superhip (filmed at an angle, chef has sleeveless T-shirt) to extremely low-pressure shows for frazzled moms (today's dessert: whipped cream!), but they all pale in the face of the program called &quot;Dulces Tentaciones&quot;, starring the Swiss radical nun Sister Bernarda.   This fantasy grandmother shows you how to make tarts, tortes, and other old world desserts, carefully cleaning her work area in between recipes while classical guitar or flute plays in the background.   It is the most relaxing television program ever created, better than any drug, better than any steak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This guide was originally written for foreign residents in Argentina and contains a lot of useful information; some basic tourist info has  been bolted on to widen its market, but it still looks like a good resource.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 160%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;Individual liberty is the single most important value that society should uphold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I’m more utilitarian and communitarian now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I still believe we should be extremely skeptical of sacrificing individual liberties for the sake of a greater good (in practice if not in theory), but I no longer hold liberty as sacrosanct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was interesting to read because I also was on this journey where I believed in individual liberty as being most important for a long time but over the last 2-3 years have started to question it, and have become a tad bit more communitarian.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I would love to hear about your experiences or the thought process which led you to question the long held beliefs and change your views.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;The remainder of this post is the response I shared with him (slightly modified for clarity).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's always tenuous to explain why someone changed their mind—especially your own, since it's &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;so easy to delude yourself&lt;/span&gt;—but I'll give it a try!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There wasn't a single lightbulb moment. Rather, it was a combination of several new frames of reference + a shift in my underlying values to which I only put a name after the fact + a radical change in my context.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I. New frames of reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Some of the key &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;new frames of reference&lt;/span&gt; I gained were:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;1. Intuition about externalities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I internalized the significance of externalities in a far more profound way. I mostly picked up this frame up reference through more plain old life experience and recognizing more instances of positive/negative externalities in day-to-day life. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Moving to a city especially drove this home. The side effects of others' behavior (and your own!) become self-evident when you live in close proximity to many people. Every time a motorcycle roars down my street at 3am, I'm reminded yet again that externalities are real and omnipresent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;2. The framing of &quot;coordination problems&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I learned the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://conceptually.org/concepts/coordination-problems&quot;&gt;coordination problems&lt;/a&gt;. This helped me see that some circumstances can systematically result in suboptimal outcomes for individual agents even when they're behaving in their own best interest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I came to pick up this concept through stumbling upon game theory, studying it, and then extending its implications to daily life. I just plain didn't have this label when I was 16 years old, so it was much harder to recognize the importance of this category of problems, which meant my views didn't address them. I now can't help but see instances of this category everywhere!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;3. Personal experience of working in a pack for the first time, rather than as a lone wolf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I personally experienced the feeling of joy that comes from being embedded in the fabric of a team that's greater than the sum of its parts. For contrast, I also saw people who I care about experience (and to some extent also personally experiencing myself) the isolation that can come about from being excessively independent. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This transition in my thinking occurred because I went from schoolwork, where excelling is a very individual activity, to actual work in the real world, where you really can't get much done without coordinating with other talented people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;II. Underlying shifts in values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here are some other changes more as &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;shifts in my underlying values&lt;/span&gt;, which are harder to explain from the result of specific events:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;4. Physical laws aren't such a useful analogy for moral systems &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;16-year-old Devon thought of morals as something that could be reducible to axioms, much in the way that physics/mechanics is reducible to basic laws. I thought that moral axioms of some sort were &quot;out there to be discovered&quot;, independent of whether or not humans followed them, sort of like how physics is real even if you don't believe it it. (It's not a coincidence this happened around the time I started to study physics.) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I came to realize that this was wishful thinking and not actually a &quot;correct&quot; way to view the world. Sure it'd be &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;nice&lt;/span&gt; if morality were that simple—just find the Newtonian laws or Maxwell's equations for ethics, and you're good to go!—but that doesn't mean that's actually the way things work. I realized I couldn't actually think of a reason why moral laws would be discoverable and &quot;out there to be discovered&quot; in the same way the laws of physics were, so I stopped believing it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This was a more gradual process than I've made it sound... there was no epiphany moment, the fact that what I believed was groundless over time steadily came into focus.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;5. Preference utilitarianism as a new (theoretical) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;North Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Related to the previous point, I now view preference utilitarianism as a more appropriate way to judge actions, at least theoretically. I don't think it's practical to actually know what everyone's preferences are, let alone to calculate them all out when deciding your own course of action, but in theory I do think it's the proper thing to strive for. At the very least it's a useful debugger. (I'll write more on that at some point in the future.) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The best (worst?) part is that it's nicely circular: my preference is for the world to maximize preference utility for all other conscious beings on earth, so within that system it's by definition correct! (Whether it's actionable is a different question...) This means it avoids the trap of &quot;discoverable axioms&quot; and the physical laws analogy mentioned above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;6. I downgraded the importance of consistency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I now value intellectual/moral consistency far less than I once did. I used to think consistency was paramount, that if you were inconsistent then you &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; change your views to become consistent, and in turn to be moral. Now, I see consistency as a useful heuristic but not the be-all-end all. All things equal, consistency is still something to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;strive for&lt;/span&gt;, but all things are not equal. Life is full of uncertainty, so if you enforce consistency on all your beliefs then you're most likely to just be wrong about &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;. All it takes is for your assumptions to be slightly off for you to now get everything wrong. Relaxing that constraint of consistency gives you more opportunity to error correct. And there will certainly be errors—it's foolish to think it's possible to always be correct—so error correction is crucial for having any hope of &quot;correctness&quot;, whatever that means.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's like if you're trying to get from point A to point B, and you know a few landmarks along the way but you don't know exactly how to get there. If you go in exactly the direction of the first landmark you see and refuse to change course when you see another one at a slightly different angle, then you're going to be way off base the farther away from your starting point you get. If you instead update your angle each time you see another landmark a bit off the mark from what you remembered, you'll zig zag a bit, but you'll end up heading in the roughly right direction on average. (Though of course you're totally screwed if you don't notice the landmarks in the first place!) Just like these sanity checks are crucial for effective navigation, they're also crucial for your moral judgements. If you're doing something because it's consistent with your other actions, but it feels like the outcome is horrible for the world, then that's good reason to change the action or at least reflect on it long and hard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;III. Changes in context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And finally here are the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;changes in context&lt;/span&gt; that had a big impact, most obvious being that I'm no longer an undergrad at a university in the SF Bay Area:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;7. My identity is less centered on intellectual edginess than it once was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's the most cynical answer: I came to care less about &quot;edginess&quot; in my views than I did in high school and college. Valuing individual liberty above all else was controversial in my college environment. I was hooked on the feeling of being different and borderline extreme, and now I really care so much less. That's probably because I have more things on which to peg my identity and feelings of self worth than my opinions. I actually build things and make things happen in the world now! Far more satisfying than writing op-eds in a fringe college newspaper. Not to say that wasn't a good use of my time back then—I'm very glad I did it—but I'm glad that wasn't my peak.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;8. When playing the part of Devil's Advocate, I accidentally became a method actor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I often play Devil's Advocate when I think a useful perspective was omitted from the conversation. When I see a conversation has gone too far in one direction, I often pull it in the other direction to give it more balance. Historically, I thought it would be necessary to make a more extreme argument than what I actually believed in the hope it'll average out. (It's a whole other conversation as to whether that's an effective strategy...)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/9b9ee2ca-90e2-4baf-b6a7-79682b76fa8d/aafc5a3a-3597-47e9-9b97-a859bceac3c1.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, at Stanford there's a widespread, deeply-rooted belief across most of the students and faculty that guns can only be bad, and that the world would &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/span&gt; be better off if we straight up banned them. My intuition was actually not that far off from that, but it was disturbing that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;no one&lt;/span&gt; around me questioned this dogma. And it was even more disturbing as I dug into it and found that my peers held this belief without actually having spent any time thinking about it. So I dove into research and made the case for why guns, concealed carry permits, etc were actually a great idea. I actually was not personally convinced that they're a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;great&lt;/span&gt; idea per se, but I was sure that (a) they're not literally the devil like the people around me thought they were and (b) they have &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; societal value, even if it's small. So I wanted to cause people to examine their beliefs a bit more and make the case, since it seemed like no one else was going to do it. I value having the best case made for every idea, no matter how terrible it is, so that the world can judge it as best as possible, and I saw a big gap for that particular issue (as well as others). That said, &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;&quot;&gt;I mixed up trying to pull the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window&quot;&gt;Overton Window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;&quot;&gt; in a particular direction with actually holding the extreme view&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Now with this framing, let's zoom back out to the question &quot;why the emphasis on liberty?&quot;. It's because that dimension seemed to be drastically undervalued by my peers and role models. The folks I knew in the Bay Area tended to suggest more government as the solution to most problems, and that seemed like to automatic an answer to me, so I wanted to challenge that. The people I work with most closely/spend time with now don't have nearly as strong a tendency to default to more government control, so I feel less a need to challenge them on that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It'll be interesting to see how my perspective continues to change in the coming years. 🙂 &lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;You're not allowed inside the Duomo with your shoulders uncovered. We learned this the hard way. I was wearing a spaghetti strap dress (it's 92℉/33℃ and humid here in Milan), so they stopped my little group at the entrance, after we'd already purchased 3 tickets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/6b0e3cee-dc79-4a20-8ee8-8d2736915ccb/6b6009d0-9934-434d-ab09-00bd7d20edbb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Luckily, we only had about 15 seconds of frustration. I said &quot;Ah that's a shame&quot;, Sebastián responded &quot;Oh I'm sure there's a shop around here somewhere&quot;, Tyler said &quot;Markets in everything...&quot;, and then we looked up and sure enough there was a street seller approaching with an armful of 2€ kimonos!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We made it into the cathedral with barely skipping a step. Thank you, goddess of commerce.&lt;/div&gt;

    <category term="tools-for-thought" />
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;My friends say that my calendaring practice is atypical (and mock me incessantly for it). They're not wrong, but I'll contend that most people underutilize this ubiquitous tool. A calendar is not just a reminder device for keeping track of external events. Used right, a calendar can be a full-fledged tool for thought. For me, it's a dynamic journal with a wide range of useful, meaningful, and surprising perks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here are some of the more idiosyncratic reasons I value my calendar so much:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Scaffolding for a memory palace:&lt;/span&gt; Calendar events inevitably neglect most relevant details about the past, but nonetheless they can serve as a trigger to place you in your memory palace. They create anchors in your mind that can help you recall other details.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Chronometer of the past: &lt;/span&gt;It's instrumentally useful when you're trying to figure out the chronology or casualty of some that's happened to you in the past. For example, my boyfriend and I couldn't remember the day we started dating, so we scrolled back in my calendar's history to determine when to celebrate our anniversary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Self reflection:&lt;/span&gt; It's a useful tool for honestly reflecting on how you use your time. I've changed some behaviors from looking back on past weeks and seeing that I'm spending more time than I thought on things that I don't actually care about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Planner:&lt;/span&gt; Calendars are helpful for visualizing your time, which gives you superpowers over how you spend that time. While this isn't too far off from how people already use calendars, I think it's vastly underrated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Pleasant nostalgia:&lt;/span&gt; It's pleasantly nostalgic to look back on the person you used to be. 😊 While doing my taxes recently, I was scrolling through my calendar to remind myself of my various income sources (i.e. for the &quot;Chronometer&quot; reason), and it made the experience of doing my taxes actively pleasant because it was a nice reminder of all of the interesting things I did in 2018. What a good year that was!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Most people I know use calendars solely as a way to coordinate events in the far future and/or with other parties. They generally have the following, fairly limited purposes in mind:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;To ensure that they have the same information as the other participant(s),&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;To have a reminder of blocked off time so they don't accidentally double-book, and&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;To store information about the location and timing that they only care about as the event approaches.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are a few additional steps I take that extend my calendar's usefulness into other contexts, too:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I often add events retroactively, i.e. events that have already occurred (which is useless to a calendar user who only uses it to prepare for future events).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I add events for personal &quot;events&quot; as well as external ones. For example, I have events for chores, work tasks, sleep, showers, and  weekend projects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;For personal events, I include a lot of detail in the event title (and sometimes extend into the notes) and don't worry much about editing it to be optimally readable. The purpose is to jog my memory with as much interesting mental state and intention from that moment I created the event as possible, not to communicate as effectively as possible with the outside world. I do try to clean up the phrasing for external events (where there's 1+ invitee) more, since they don't want to deal with my messy brain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I color code my calendars into rough categories. Not sure how useful it is but it certainly makes my calendar prettier to look at. 🤓&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;max-width: 150px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/cac54bb4-008f-4224-a877-e174c91b35aa/455ad37b-8e7d-4a06-92e8-7aa6736abc02.png&quot; width=&quot;121&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One question I always get is &quot;how do you have the discipline to enter everything, especially retroactively?!&quot;. One answer is that I don't. I often forget! And that's fine.&lt;span id='footnote-label--1' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#367ca2&quot;&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The purpose of my calendar diary is not to be a perfect record of how I spend my time. It's a map of the territory, and the purpose is to trigger useful and interesting memories, reminders, and ambitions that don't fit as well in other mediums (including my own mind). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A more useful answer: I think of this input step in terms of triggers—i.e. what moments call for me to add something to my calendar, and what's the reminder? A few examples:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When someone invites me to an event, I add the event + location + notes to my calendar. (This one is pretty typical I think.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I'm planning my tasks for the day, I block off the rough amounts of time I expect various goals to take. This is useful for prioritizing time visually. It's easier to reason about an abstract thing (whether it's a calendar or an essay or a math problem) once you've written it down. These time blocks almost always change through the day as different things come up, or when tasks take longer/shorter than expected; the important thing isn't that they're correct when you first &quot;draft&quot; the events, just that it gives you something to work off of.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have repeating events for things like my daily workout. I often move around the exact timing on a per-day basis, but just having it blocked off as &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; time in my calendar is helpful so that I remember to make time for it. Below, you can see how I have the recurring &quot;25-minute workout&quot; scheduled every single day &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;in the future&lt;/span&gt; for 8:30pm. I don't actually do the exercises at that exact time usually, but it helps me remember that I've budgeted 25 minutes of my day to doing that. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do intermittent fasting on most days, and I mark that eating window on my calendar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;These triggers are somewhat personal, so I wouldn't recommend any specific one to others. These can just be used as inspiration.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The habit has evolved organically over many years, so I don't have a grand strategy that's easy to articulate. This is a brain dump and not at all comprehensive, just the first things that popped to mind. I just hope this sparked some ideas in your head for creative uses of calendars. I'd love to hear about other unconventional ways you use calendars, too!&lt;/div&gt;

I even went so far as to impose standard titles across like events. For instance, I would slap myself if I wrote one event as &quot;Shower&quot; and another as &quot;Shower time&quot;—how was I supposed to reconcile all this messiness?! I imagined that at some point I'd programmatically analyze the calendar data and get useful RescueTime like insights out of it. I now realize that's a fool's errand, and that a calendar is at best a useful map of my time. I shouldn't even try to mold it into the territory itself, because it's impossible to transfer the depth of richness that is how a human spends their time into a grid, no matter how many different color-coded categories you have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Thanks to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurademing&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Laura Deming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; whose email query prompted this writeup!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, a minority of a group might object to a particular proposal, and even after discussion still think the proposal is deeply problematic, but decide that they don’t have the energy to argue against it and say, &quot;Forget it, do what you want&quot;. That surely can be called a compromise […] but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 16px; color: black; font-family: &quot;Caecilia Web&quot;, Georgia, serif; line-height: 1.375; font-style: italic; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;really all that they’ve done is capitulated.

If we applied a standard of perfection and complete consensus to the things we shipped, we’d quickly become sluggish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;overflow-wrap: break-word; z-index: 4; position: relative; border: none; margin: 36px -6rem; padding: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: 32px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer; box-shadow: rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px, rgb(255, 206, 191) 0px 0px 0px; text-shadow: none; background-color: rgb(255, 206, 191); max-width: none; font-size: 32px; color: black; font-family: &quot;Graphik Web&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.66667; font-style: italic; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;&quot;&gt;We risk more when we delay decisions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 32px; color: rgb(36, 36, 36); font-family: &quot;Graphik Web&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.66667; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; in an attempt to reach total consensus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; color: rgb(36, 36, 36); font-family: &quot;Caecilia Web&quot;, Georgia, serif; line-height: 1.77778;&quot;&gt;Thanks to our &quot;hell yeah&quot; approach to hiring, we can trust the competence and diligence of the person making the decision.

We believe we’re a stronger company for it. But as we’ve learned, this requires effort and self-awareness from all parties to the discussion. We’re not there yet, but the principles of rough consensus can be useful in balancing feedback and efficiency in all of our decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I snapped many photos while wandering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa&quot;&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt; last week, as I always do whenever I see something new or interesting while exploring a city. I was with my friend Tyler, who conspicuously does not take photos while exploring a new place. I asked him why, and his answer was, &quot;It's a distraction, and I can find better images online.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The first half of his answer really resonated with me. I too find it distracting to document something in the midst of experiencing that thing. It disrupts the &quot;flow&quot; of a moment, and when you zero in on something, it narrows your field of vision and can cause you to miss other interesting details just outside of the frame.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The second part of his answer made sense, too. During that conversation, we were facing the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraces_(Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD)&quot;&gt;Bahá’í Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. I'd snapped a photo just moments before, and he's right that the photos of the gardens I found online are far more spectacular than whatever I shot with my cell phone (despite what the Shot on iPhone ads may lead you to believe).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To pile on the anti-photo train just a bit more, I'd add that taking photos can be rude to the people you're with. Live-documenting a moment—whether in the form of incessant photography, live tweets, or even old-fashioned pen and paper notes—subtly signals &quot;I care more about how my future self reflects on this moment (or, worse, what the internet thinks) than about the experience you and I are sharing right now.&quot; &lt;span id='footnote-label--1' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller; vertical-align: super; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 377px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 377px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 377px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e0f1a5f9-e98e-49fe-8a53-a930decb3ef8/e8b3d602-fd8d-4b2a-9a1d-2282adf59baf.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 377px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e0f1a5f9-e98e-49fe-8a53-a930decb3ef8/d9b434c2-56ba-420a-80b4-f946a6582797.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; Images has a sea of stunning photos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bahá’í Gardens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(left). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;My&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(121, 121, 121); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; photography (above) doesn't quite compare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In other words, I agree that photos can be distracting and unnecessary, not to mention borderline rude. So why do I take photos?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I love capturing the little moments of daily life that happen at street level as I'm wandering around a city, whether it's a new one an ocean away or my own neighborhood in San Francisco. These are very different from the photos of the Eiffel Tower that every visitor to Paris has somewhere in their phone camera, different from the ones you'll find on travel guides or city government websites. You can't easily find the pictures I want on Google Images. I've yet to find a consistent good source of photos capturing exactly what it is that I find interesting on a city street, the sort of thing that I want to include in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/tag/city-reviews&quot;&gt;City Reviews&lt;/a&gt; exploring the effects of infrastructure, culture, geography, and history on the day-to-day life of people living in that place. The only alternative is to capture them myself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even if I don't use the photos directly, they also help reconstruct my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci&quot;&gt;memory palace&lt;/a&gt; later. I enjoy reflecting on the places I go and researching more deeply the observations I noticed there, but I often lose the pointers to those memories in my mind. The memories are there, but they're hard to retrieve without some trigger to resurface them. Flipping through my photo album can jog my memory and take me deeper down a rabbit hole. &lt;span id='footnote-label--2' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Photos also capture only a small part of how it feels to be in a place and time, so it really matters to me that I know exactly the context of where a photo was shot for me to be able to appreciate the place-ness of that photograph. When I'm writing about an Urban Chasm I experienced in Barcelona or a Narrow Street for People in Saigon, I want to recall the fabric of the city around it to begin to understand how it fits into the city system as a whole. I don't want just any Parisian street corner; I want the specific Parisian street corner where I noticed all of the woven plastic cafe chairs facing in on the same little square, like an audience facing the stage of a ballet that's about to begin, and how it was a little oasis of calm despite a major boulevard one block away because of the geometry of the buildings and the crooked little streets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e0f1a5f9-e98e-49fe-8a53-a930decb3ef8/4edf7d69-2aa7-4a89-8f89-0ceadac38cf0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 130px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e0f1a5f9-e98e-49fe-8a53-a930decb3ef8/9e8f721b-4150-4b10-9331-577fd2f4715b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have my own interpretation on how the world looks and feels, as do you and everyone else. The details that jump out to me differ from what will jump out to my mom, which differ from what will jump out to an architect, which differ from what will jump out to an economist, and so on. Photos are a little window into how a person perceives the world. Selfishly, I want more little windows into the way other people think, and I enjoy opening my own for others to catch a glimpse, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's true that taking photos comes at a cost. But I'm willing to pay that cost&lt;span id='footnote-label--3' class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; style=&quot;cursor: pointer !important; line-height: 1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when it's a matter of capturing something that others might overlook.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Of course sometimes that is the right tradeoff, and it can even be a sign of respect in the case of something like scribbling down notes about some insight that your conversation partner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/timeline&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;Google Maps Timeline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;is also useful for this purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(128, 128, 128); color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;It's invaluable for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; retracing my steps on a given day and reconstructing my memory of what I did. For example, here's my timeline map for the day in Haifa:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#7b54ff&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 12px; max-width: 500px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/e0f1a5f9-e98e-49fe-8a53-a930decb3ef8/ec4bd0ad-796e-451f-8dcb-bb82a5c8356d.png&quot; width=&quot;196&quot;/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnote-content--3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; font-size: smaller; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;The conversation in Haifa did get me thinking. &lt;i&gt;Most&lt;/i&gt; of my photos are of the individual perspective type, but whenever I end up with a famous landmark in front of me I'm in the habit of snapping the same predictable pictures as any other traveler. These photos do just diminish the experience of seeing the thing with no real upside, so in the future I will be more intentional to restrict myself to taking photos that I think i'll only get if I myself take them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--1').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $(&quot;#footnote-content--1&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-label--1').offset().top}, 200);}); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--2&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--2').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $(&quot;#footnote-content--2&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-label--2').offset().top}, 200);}); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() {$(&quot;#footnote-label--3&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-content--3').offset().top}, 200);});})&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $(&quot;#footnote-content--3&quot;).click(function () {$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#footnote-label--3').offset().top}, 200);}); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;For ages, I've wondered why Google Docs still clings to the sheet-of-paper metaphor when lots of its users never print out most of their documents.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course it does make sense for &quot;Print layout&quot; to be an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;option&lt;/span&gt;. Many people &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; print docs, and students make up a huge portion of the users. What I find strange is that Google Docs &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;imposes&lt;/span&gt; this UI—you cannot escape the sheet of paper with its edges and isomorphic physicality even if you're just creating what's in effect an editable webpage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Though I've wondered this for a long time, I only just verbalized this yesterday: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why does &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/googledocs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@GoogleDocs&lt;/a&gt; still impose the sheet-of-paper metaphor? In many organizations, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if &amp;lt;5% of documents were ever printed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ironically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dropbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; Paper is the one that finally embraced the fact that most docs today are really just dynamic webpages.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Devon ☀️ (@devonzuegel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1127421463647023104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;my-highlight&quot;&gt;Saying it &quot;out loud&quot; had an interesting effect: it made me realize I already had a solution!&lt;/span&gt; I've used a Chrome extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne&quot;&gt;Stylus&lt;/a&gt; for years, a custom styles manager that allows you to add custom CSS to any page you visit. I had just not put two and two together to realize that was more than enough to get to a workable solution. So thanks world, for drawing out a solution latent in my brain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 209px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 209px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 209px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;bordered&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nKFYqKP.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 209px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;After&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;bordered&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0NcafFD.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps to replicate it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Install the Stylus Chrome extension: &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne&quot;&gt;chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Make sure you have `Print mode` checked off: &lt;div style=&quot;margin: 8px 0; max-width: 280px&quot; class=&quot;disable-img-click&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;bordered&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/itFizRV.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Add a few lines of custom CSS: &lt;div style=&quot;margin: 8px 0&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/devonzuegel/064b146f49d207d29724252863321821.js?file=clean-google-docs.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enjoy your clean, web-native Google documents!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-top: 8px&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;bordered&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nKFYqKP.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The downside to this approach is that it's visible only to you. The document you're creating appears different to other people, since they don't have the extension installed and populated with your styles, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message&quot;&gt;not ideal&lt;/a&gt;. That said, it's easy enough to toggle off the custom styles that it's not that hard to temporarily view what it looks from other views.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;A special characteristic of open source software (OSS) is that you don't need institutional support to get started. It's interesting to compare this to physical infrastructure, like dams or railroads. Before you can begin those projects, you need upfront capital, permits, rights-of-way, environmental impact reviews, community hearings... and so much more. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By contrast, all you need in order to begin a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;digital&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure project is an internet connection and some free time. As a result, OSS projects only confront governance challenges once they've become prominent and complex enough to warrant formal solutions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 159px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 174px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 159px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/7f61191d-131a-4417-83fd-e46e382e1086/70ab5cc2-7ef2-4c72-89c7-c04d2030fb48.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;hard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; to create new physical infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 174px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/7f61191d-131a-4417-83fd-e46e382e1086/1bdf6c54-64a9-44f8-9056-c8a7c9e34a09.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt;It is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;easy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;&gt; to start a new open source project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;This low barrier to entry makes software exciting! It's one of my favorite things about this industry. Any developer with a good idea can share it with the world, without asking for permission.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It also means that OSS maintainers are forced to confront questions about governance (e.g. decision-making, funding, and communication) later, often once the project has already become an important dependency to other projects and communities. This has some interesting implications for how projects resolve these challenges.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On one hand, the delayed germination of governance problems makes it harder to find solutions. Here are a few reasons why:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The community is larger and more diverse:&lt;/span&gt; By the time governance problems rear their head, a wider range of people have a stake in the project. This scale makes it harder to resolve governance challenges, because those involved have competing ideas about what the solutions should be. This increases the likelihood of controversy. Earlier in a project's life, when decisions affect fewer people, the community is nimble and capable of communicating big changes. When important questions are raised later (for example: &quot;Who's in charge?&quot; or &quot;Where does the money come from?&quot;), there are many more actors who want to shape the answers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Users have preset expectations:&lt;/span&gt; The increased scope of a project simply makes it harder to change anything at all, regardless of the specific direction of the change. Every project operates by a set of rules, whether or not they are deliberate, and the community that forms around the project will come to depend on that structure. If you create a formal system where there were previously-accidental rules, it changes the way a project functions, upsetting the community's expectations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's similar to what happens when you introduce a bug into an API. By the time you find it and want to fix it, users have come to depend on the buggy behavior, and it would disrupt their integration if you were to change it. It can worth that disruption cost (in the case of both governance and API design), but it is a cost, and it makes that change all the more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The maintainer may not be prepared or eager to solve governance problems:&lt;/span&gt; Just as many startup founders discover that running a late-stage company requires a very different skillset than finding early product-market fit, the developers who create OSS are often excited about the early technological experimentation but less so about persuading people, facilitating disputes, securing funding, and establishing communication practices. (There are OSS maintainers who do have this desire and skillset, but it's not the default.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On the other hand, this delay can in some ways make it easier to find solutions to governance problems:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The project has room to grow: &lt;/span&gt;One advantage of this dynamic is that OSS projects don't have to spend early effort solving problems that fall outside of their core competency before they even know if the project will work. They can &quot;lazy-load&quot; their governance problems until they know it's worth their time to develop solutions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As an analogy, imagine you're thinking of getting into cycling—you should not spend hours researching the perfect bike or forking over thousands of dollars for the perfect carbon fiber frame. Instead, borrow a friend's bike or rent one for a weekend to go for a spin. After all, you're not even sure if you're ready to commit yet! OSS projects are similar. You don't know how useful it is until people start using it, so you're better off focusing on just getting it to work before spending brain cycles worrying about the governance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Problems are solved from experience rather than hazy predictions:&lt;/span&gt; Lazy-loading governance also means that you have a better understanding of what problems you're solving for in the first place. In physical infrastructure, governance is decided before a community fully understands the needs and repercussions of that project, which can result in wasting effort to solve nonexistent or misunderstood problems.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's like buying furniture before finding an apartment—you're likely to misjudge what you actually need, requiring you to go back to IKEA once you've moved in. The low barrier to entry of software means that an OSS community has a chance to bump into the problem in the real world a few times before they're forced to come up with a solution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This ability to &quot;lazy-load governance&quot; is an important structural characteristic of OSS. It brings unique challenges, but it's also a great advantage to working with bits rather than atoms. Understanding this dynamic can help communities predict and prepare for some of the challenges they face as they grow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I recently spent a day at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/t-magazine/sea-ranch-california-utopia.html&quot;&gt;Sea Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a strange and beautiful place. Sea Ranch is a planned community with a distinctive architectural style: simple timber-frame structures clad in wooden siding, and gardens all planted with native flora. The Sea Ranch Design Committee enforces &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tsra.org/photos/DM_v7-part1.pdf&quot;&gt;strict design rules&lt;/a&gt; on all 1,800 homes along that 10-mile stretch of the Northern California coast. The result is a cohesive, calming aesthetic unlike anywhere else I've been.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Depending on who you ask, Sea Ranch is either the beautiful manifestation of a bold vision, or it's &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;an exclusive dominion controlled by rules put in place generations ago&lt;/span&gt;. My view: both interpretations are correct. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 223px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/d6eb6fdf-c5a7-40a4-904e-9bc8c75c2672/2d812d5e-df64-418b-8910-cb69966c9988.png&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 223px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/d6eb6fdf-c5a7-40a4-904e-9bc8c75c2672/32885957-8771-4469-a6e1-f957b66cfef6.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;How did this eccentric place come to be? In the 1960s, a small group of architects bought the property, envisioning a community that harmonized with the environment. The guiding principle was to &quot;live lightly on the land,&quot; inspired by the lifestyle of the native Pomo Indians. The architects created a strict master plan prescribing &quot;clusters of unpainted wooden houses in large open meadow areas and not allowing fences or lawns.&quot; In the 50 years since, these guidelines have shaped Sea Ranch into something truly special, a sanctuary of natural beauty and subtle good taste.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This master plan is the key attraction, but it's also a major source of conflict. In 1972, California voters saw the private development as a threat to public coastal access, and, in direct response to Sea Ranch, they passed the Coastal Initiative to ensure public access to the state's beaches. With this regulatory change, the real estate developers who'd financed Sea Ranch wanted out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This loss of control had a predictable result: The northern part was not developed according to the original plan. &quot;Some folks say that there are essentially two Sea Ranches: the tasteful, quiet southern part and the suburban golf-playing northern sector,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archpaper.com/2015/05/sea-ranch-50/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Kenneth Caldwell in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Archpaper&lt;/span&gt;. On one hand, this was a tragic collapse of an independent, bold vision. On the other hand, it was a victory for the freedom of the rest of the community to enjoy the coastline as they wished. Both interpretations are accurate, and both are important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/d6eb6fdf-c5a7-40a4-904e-9bc8c75c2672/06be8a4c-bbec-4d5f-ad70-ac9d0a7d52a7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;354&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The plan for Sea Ranch is an example both of an individual's singular vision and also of collective conformity necessary to execute that vision. It reminds me of the dramatic storyline in &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CwFt0h&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/a&gt; about Cortlandt, a housing project designed by protagonist Howard Roark. When Roark learns that his design was compromised, he heroically dynamites the buildings to prevent the subversion of his vision. One interpretation: a case for individual expression. Another interpretation: Roark imposed his wishes on others regardless of the impact on their lives. Again, I sympathize with both interpretations. The divergence from Roark's brilliant vision was tragic, as was the destruction of what was built.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;The Objectivists I know&lt;/span&gt; usually assert the first interpretation, emphasizing the moral power of individual genius. In their rhetoric, they defend everyone's right to have the freedom to execute the kind of vision that Howard Roark represents. Unfortunately, this goal of universality is impossible to achieve—if everyone were a lone visionary, their plans will conflict, and there will be no one to support them in implementing those plans. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's interesting that Ayn Rand chose to make her protagonist an architect, a profession whose work so deeply affects communities. &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;The standard interpretation of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CwFt0h&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;is as an allegory showing that freedom and self expression are a human birthright. But if&lt;/span&gt; Rand's sole intention was to glorify individual genius, why didn't she choose some other type of creative expression instead of architecture? When an architect designs a building, it affects the entire community. Many other forms of self-expression—sculpture, literature, or music—have effects that are far more contained. Why didn't she make Howard Roark a sculptor or a painter?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My reading is that this was a deliberate choice. I think that Rand understood very well that there is a tradeoff between the primacy of one man's vision and others' submission to that vision, and she was happy to bite that bullet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What I takeaway from &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CwFt0h&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/a&gt; is that Rand believed that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; people are visionaries whose gifts the world should not suppress, and others are not worthy of that epic responsibility and should submit to the heroes' plans. I'm not sure if I agree, but I am quite sure that the universal individualism that most people ascribe to Ayn Rand's writing does not fit with the story she tells.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-en-paragraph:true;&quot;&gt;Sea Ranch's &quot;enforced tastefulness&quot; is even more invasive than the design of Rand's fictional housing project—an entire village of homeowners is submitting to the vision set by a few architects in 1965. The rules are rigid, prohibiting anyone's creativity but a small group of architects, long gone from the community.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yet as I wandered along the pristine, rugged cliffs, winding between the stunning homes that are each unique and yet formed a coherent whole, I had a hard time not feeling gratitude that there was a brief window in time in which architects reined over Sea Ranch. The place is special, and it would not be what it is today without that strict control. The important question to ask is: Was that worth trading off the independence of everyone else? That question is one I still don't know how to answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Thanks to the friends who've been part of the journey with me through these ideas over the past few years. You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(64, 64, 64);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; who you are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I must admit that I haven't read &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CwFt0h&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/a&gt; since high school. It is quite possible that my memory of it is simply a Rorschach test that reveals what I've been thinking about recently more than it does about what Ayn Rand meant to tell the world. 🙂 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To learn more about the history of Sea Ranch:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archpaper.com/2015/05/sea-ranch-50/&quot;&gt;archpaper.com/2015/05/sea-ranch-50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stayinsearanch.com/about-the-sea-ranch/&quot;&gt;stayinsearanch.com/about-the-sea-ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2018/09/25/interview-sea-ranch-architecture-environment-idealism-jennifer-dunlop-fletcher-sfmoma/&quot;&gt;dezeen.com/2018/09/25/interview-sea-ranch-architecture-environment-idealism-jennifer-dunlop-fletcher-sfmoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Finally, I usually try to balance the number of images with the actual amount of text in my essays, but the architectural style of Sea Ranch is so striking that I can't help but share more photos: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width: 223px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images.postach.io/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/d6eb6fdf-c5a7-40a4-904e-9bc8c75c2672/ee72a96f-2771-4abc-a6b7-0826c5af85f3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Attachment&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

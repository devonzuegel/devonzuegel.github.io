Actually it was worse than that‚ÄîI thought fancy build systems was what pros did, bc I took for granted that you need lots of dependencies to write a "serious" program. Yuck, now I've realized it's opposite. Good hackers know dependencies bring tradeoffs, and they minimize them.

First, I did not know the reason for Bogot√°'s densification that Solly mentioned in the episode. He said people were afraid to commute from the suburbs because they'd get kidnapped during the civil war, and so they chose to live in the city center. Wild."

"1/5 

Hey @airbnb, a recent stay really hurt my trust in your platform, and your support team's answers to my questions about what the heck happened have been disappointingly evasive."
"2/5

Context: I had a moderately bad experience with a superhost, so I left a review noting facts about the stay: no trash bags, no dish detergent, no bedding, unexpected charges, etc. (This was actually the first negative review I've ever written after 9 years of using AirBNB.)"
"3/5

A few days later, I was informed that @airbnb had deleted my review because it was ""not relevant"". This was surprising and disappointing! It's gotten me wondering if the reviews I read of other hosts are showing the full picture, or if they're inflated to boost the bookings."
"4/5

My best guess of what happened is that the host asked you to take it down because it made him look bad, and you obliged because he's a superhost. I hope that's not the case, but I can't think of any other explanation."
"5/5

Can you please share more? I really wanted to resolve this in private, but that clearly isn't working, and I think it's important for other AirBNB customers to know that you remove negative factual reviews for no apparent reason."
@irvinebroque @Airbnb That is really disappointing and concerning to hear! Was your stay with a superhost? I'm wondering if there's a pattern.
@ibealexm @Airbnb Okay good, I'm happy to hear that this likely isn't totally rampant! It is the first time I've had an issue like this after 9 years of using AirBNB, so I'm optimistic that they can fix this.
@grrosegr @Airbnb That's what I thought at first too, but then I spent a week going back-and-forth with them via DM
@MinvstrD @juliagalef @Airbnb I'm not sure I agree. One of the two most important roles @Airbnb plays in the whole transaction is ensuring trust between strangers. (The second of the two is to aggregate supply and demand to create a market.)
"1/4

Whelp, @airbnb sent an ""ambassador"" to DM with me, and they said my review was irrelevant because one of the facts I mentioned was ""out of the host's control""‚Äîspecifically, there was street noise."
"2/4

Personally I think this is valid detail to include in a review since it affects the guest's experience, but whatever, it wasn't the important bit that I wanted to communicate to future guests.

So I asked them ""how do I repost the review without that 'irrelevant' bit?"""
"3/4

They answered ""you can only edit reviews within the 48 hour window after posting them, so no dice"".

... They only informed me that my review wasn't relevant after the 48 hour period was passed! How was I supposed to know I'd need to update it?! üôÑ"
"4/4

Overall, this has been a really disappointing experience. Facilitating trust between hosts and guests is the #1 role that AirBNB plays. I'm going to be using hotels, @vacasarentals, and literally anything else except @airbnb from now on."
@skydiarystudio @vacasarentals @Airbnb Ooooh good to know! The only thing that made me hesitate to never use @airbnb again is that they do have the best supply in most markets. Thank you!
"@bchesky @vacasarentals @Airbnb Thanks Brian. I hate to do the public shaming thing &amp; tried my best to resolve it in private, but it felt like my only remaining option

@dbchhbr Thank you! Will share back with the team
@akageleiry @Airbnb Apparently they only consider facts that are "in the host's control" as relevant, which is silly IMO since it affects the guest's experience either way. (Plus in theory there are things that the host could do to deaden the noise more...)
@Susan17Airbnb @bchesky @vacasarentals @Airbnb I really hope that's not the case! My goal is to help Airbnb reach a higher standard, I don't actually even care that much about the outcome of my particular case. I just think it's really important for them to actually facilitate trust on the platform.

@siddhya @albertwenger @xdamman @ATabarrok Yeah that's a good point. Although perhaps you could make the prize so  big that there's virtually no way that a patent would compete.

1. Transforming Blank Walls
Frequent windows and doors provide improved safety by having more ""eyes on the street"". https://t.co/5qfFVzx76k"
"2. Urban Infill Redevelopment
Designing buildings that are oriented towards the street and hide parking and loading sections boost the activity of the neighborhood and help stimulate pedestrian activity and help set the framework for economic redevelopment. https://t.co/2YAg6LlVM4"
"3.  Turning Development Outward
Mixed-use neighborhood centers [...] provide neighborhood services within walking distance for residents. Notice the ground floor of this development is now both residential and commercial. https://t.co/5mfrMF8zEs"
"4.  Mixed-Use Corridors with Transit
The transportation corridor goes from just being a way to get to a destination‚Äîto a destination in-and-of itself. https://t.co/7pace2pNim"
"5. Building Communities
Allowing for a mixed-use residential and commercial live/work on ground floor-- fosters economic opportunity and provides new housing options. https://t.co/Wpcf49jkSq"
"6. Neighborhood Main Street
Transform the street from an automobile-centered transit corridor, to a pedestrian-oriented Main Street where people want to live, work, and visit. https://t.co/Mj1GuOyn9i"
"7. Creating connections
Neighborhood connectors‚Äîopen places where people congregate informally‚Äîhelp create a sense of place and community. https://t.co/WZBCMwphAh"
@FredipusRex Yeah I definitely wouldn't say that it's an unbiased description of the difference üòÖ The part that especially got me was where they describe the Administration for each, basically "Euclidian is inefficient, Form-Based is efficient". Pretty shameless!
"8. Improved streetscapes and building frontages
Building frontages are also an essential component in the creation of a pedestrian-oriented streetscape. https://t.co/A077DthGZk"
"9. Parking Garage Liner
Lining garages prevents ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù inactive zones along pedestrian-oriented sidewalks. https://t.co/85TaabzTwH"
"@mengwong They aren't pure opposites. Plus, there are other non-Euclidian ways of approaching zoning, e.g. Japan's approach to zoning: https://t.co/HQdkgVRCw4

Owning a tool is qualitatively different from borrowing/renting it short-term. When a tool is continuously accessible, you come up with new opportunities to apply it. It's almost as if the tool itself pulls project ideas out of you!
I used to think "oh if I need a [glue / hammer / sewing kit / insert-tool-here], I'll figure out how to get access to one when it's necessary". But in the past few months I've amassed a modest drawer of a tools, and it's totally changed my relationship to my house.
I'm much more likely to modify my environment to my tastes than I was before. It's great! Makes me want to think about what other tools I want around the house so they can pull more fun projects out of me.

"Are there cities that have experimented with giving equity to residents? Or at least an academic literature on the topic?

(Traditional land ownership is somewhat similar, but has critical differences that make it different from what i  have in mind.)"
"Maybe for each year you live there you earn X shares of the city's overall tax revenue and/or Y votes

And maybe the number decreases each progressive year, so that long-time residents have slightly more upside and/or political power, but don't totally dominate newcomers"
Or maybe you get the same number each year but just use something like @glenweyl's quadratic voting so that having way more votes only translates to a bit more political power
"In most cities today, land ownership is a proxy for the financial upside aspect of what I'm talking about, but it has some major issues

These issues stem from the fact that land is both an investment AND a consumption good, and those purposes are often in conflict"
"Example A:
If a factory is built near your house, it might create opportunities for lots of other people in the city, generate tax revenue, and increase the average value of land in the city, but it'll decrease the value of your land because it's immediately adjacent to it"
"Example B:
If the city builds a subway near your house, it'll be good for the community as a whole. It may even increase your land's value, but if you're old you might not care‚Äîyou have to deal with the construction noise but won't benefit from many years of the new subway line"
"@jbrucj Mmmmm that's interesting! Say more!

I'm curious to explore alternatives adjacent to this too, I'm not too married to the specific mechanism"
If you had equity in the city instead of just owning land, then you'd have more of an incentive to support a change that was good for the community as a whole (though notably, it still wouldn't solve for problem B, since the hypothetical person cares more about their time than $)

"@jsonbecker Is it more that (a) you think it wouldn't do much to align incentives, (b) it's just not fair for residents to get rich just because their community generated wealth, or (c) something else entirely?

"Whenever I'm out of town, I chafe at the fact that I'm leaving my house empty

I'm sure there's *someone* in my social circle who'd love a way to stay in my city for free. (Plus, I need someone to water my plants!)

The problem is it's hard to find each other, to coordinate"
"Inversely, when I travel, I always wonder if a friend has an empty place that I just don't know about (and maybe they need plant watering too!)

This is partially motivated by saving money, but even more because it's just plain more comfortable to stay in a real home than a hotel"
"Does anyone else feel the same way?

I've been thinking about ways to match friends who share this pet peeve, and I'm curious how many people would be interested"

Something about tech company perks never quite added up for me. If a recruit chooses your company because of the massages and ping pong table, isn't that a *negative* signal about how seriously they're going to take the job?
I understand perks like free meals, laundry, etc (reducing chores ‚Üí more time to work), but the beer on tap makes less sense to me
@qedkorc Yes!
@ChuckBeretz Do you think your company would've done just fine without offering many of the perks?
@clarabellum The breaks interpretation is a good take
@tweetsbenedict This matches my experience
"@michael_nielsen I agree with that! My concern is a little different than that, though I don't think I did a good job of articulating it

If someone chooses your company because of the perks rather than what the work itself is, isn't that a sign that they are unserious about the work?"
"@michael_nielsen I guess it depends on what we're assuming people are choosing between

If they're choosing between 2 places with work that would give them a lot of meaning, and Company A has better perks than Company B, then I don't see a problem either..."
"@michael_nielsen ... but if A has amazing perks but they don't care about the work vs B with mediocre perks but work they find deeply meaningful, and they choose Company A, I see that as a strong negative signal

Do you still disagree with that formulation?"
"@michael_nielsen Blurgh Twitter threading: https://t.co/s7dsrbkxDs

I agree that ""serious about ping pong ‚â† unserious about work""

But from a Bayesian perspective, an employee who chose your company because of the ping pong seems likely to rate the work less highly in their priorities"
@michael_nielsen Put differently: I would never consider "likes ping pong" as a dealbreaker, but I would update slightly negatively on it if they told me it was their deciding factor
"@KaseyKlimes @michael_nielsen From the way some of my past classmates and colleagues talked about the perks companies offer, I believe perks *are* a deciding factor for a lot of people

I don't have strong evidence on this though, just gut feel!"
@jbraunstein914 The aesthetics/values of the founders bit makes a lot of sense! It definitely tells you something about the culture of the place too

@looserooster Very curious to hear what it was that you disliked!
"Lots of good replies that are helping me understand it a bit better! 

If I were running a company I'd still offer way fewer perks than most tech startups, but I'm slightly swayed by some of the answers in this thread

Thanks everyone üòä"
@ctbeiser Yes I think this is a very real answer. If employees have sway to have fancy snacks and massages, that implies that they have a lot of negotiating power over management, which can transfer to other issues they care about more in the future

@proales @ThetaHedgie @mattyglesias @KelseyTuoc This probably wasn't clear from the original tweet, but I'm not talking about the lunches (for which the tax reasoning makes tons of sense), I'm talking about the massages, ping pong tables, etc that aren't basic necessities in the same way as food

"@lacker @BitcoinWriter @BitcoinWriter I meant the q totally sincerely!

My experience at tech companies has been that the people who decide on where to work primarily* based on perks tend to be less effective/hardworking, so I've been mystified by how much employers emphasize perks when recruiting"
"@lacker @BitcoinWriter *This is an important qualifier that I clearly didn't emphasize enough in the OP, since many misunderstood it

I see why some perks are valuable. What I don't understand is why they're so emphasized in recruiting vs other things that (I believe) correlate more with performance"
"@lacker @BitcoinWriter And @lacker thank you for your answer, I hadn't considered how important it'd be for someone who's just recently moved to a new city

(I was one of those rare ones who grew up and went to college in the Bay Area, so when I moved to SF for my first job I already had friends)"
"Has anyone pulled off the classic ""I want live on the same street as my friends"" thing?

I'm asking in the context of highly mobile friends who generally have a lot of other priorities too, not the context where you grew up in a small town where no one left in the first place"
@sallar Lovely! How did you coordinate it? And are you going to get others to join too?
@rsnous This is something I love about the graph note-taking model. When I'm writing something, I can loop in a block with my TODOs or a list of qs I want to address in the essay or whatever and then delete the reference (without destroying the block) when I don't need it anymore
@rsnous It treats everything as building blocks that can be mixed in anywhere, rather than being stuck in the note where you wrote it down. It's still rooted in that original note, i.e. you can see where it came from (which is very important too!), but you can use it elsewhere no problem
RT @rsnous: chat as an interaction-space that you map other stuff into, like the filesystem, which then gives you a lot of functionality for free
"@rsnous I've been meaning to build a chat app just for myself where I can jot down notes on the fly while walking around

I like how the chat UI has time implicitly embedded in it just by the ordering of the messages. I'd also want it to capture my coordinates, the weather, etc"
"@rsnous I also like how the chat UI doesn't make you think ""where should I input this text?"" Everything goes in the same place, the text box at the bottom

By contrast, note-taking apps make you think ""Where should this go?"" before you even know what it is! Intimidating"
@rsnous Then when I'm back on my laptop, when I want to do something with the fragments I've collected, I can view the messages I've sent to myself in a different form. Maybe a spreadsheet-style thing so I can get a bird's eye view of what I've been thinking about today
@rsnous I'd want the original fragment to be immutable, just like a message. That captures the point in time when I captured that thought most cleanly. Even typos can communicate something about my mental state at that time!
"@rsnous But I'd also have a way to create a v2/v3/etc with provenance to the original fragment so that it can evolve over time

The desktop UI would offer additional tools to mix it into other fragments, and generally use it as an ingredient in bigger things I build up from there"
@rsnous I've experimented with using @messenger for this purpose, but they don't treat the task of viewing past messages with respect, so it doesn't really work
@abhishek1point0 @rsnous @messenger I'd love to play with the prototype!!!
"@rsnous @messenger I hesitate to share these rough mocks I made for the mobile bit‚Äîthey don't really show what's exciting to me about this idea‚Äîbut I'll share anyways in case they're at all helpful

"in discussions of declining fertility rates, the fact that many women are terrified of giving birth almost never comes up

women are acutely aware that pregnancy can be extremely painful, cause lifelong physical damage, and even be life-threatening

this seems... relevant..."
from talking to my female friends, most actually do want to have kids! they're just not sure how many times they want to risk their health and go through one of the most painful experiences of their lives. I suspect this is an important rate limiter on how many children are born
"it makes me wonder: if you could guarantee safe and comfortable pregnancies, what would happen to fertility rates worldwide?

my guess is this would have a greater impact than almost any other intervention that is commonly proposed"
"@abettertake yeah to be clear, I don't think this is a driver in the *change* in fertility rates

it's more that if we want to bring rates up, this is one lever we could focus on"
@abettertake well let me amend that‚Äîfear of birth isn't driving the decline on its own, BUT I do think that existing fear combined with increasing opportunity costs is a driver

"@abettertake ahhh interesting. I see our delta now, thank you! and the airplane analogy is v helpful

I think you're right that the opportunity cost of raising kids has a much bigger impact than the fear of giving birth, though I think it's more like a 1:5 ratio (at least for me)"
@abettertake I'd separate out birth control from the other two because I think of it more as a tool for carrying out your tradeoffs around your health, opportunities, etc, which to me puts it in a different category of causes
"@abettertake birth control is *crucially* important, don't get me wrong, but it's downstream of your preferences

if there were zero opportunity cost/health risk/etc, people would use birth control less and happily have more kids, because the relative costs would be lower in the first place"

"@0xMork @FredipusRex I agree that people who don't have to go through it (primarily men/fathers) often heavily discount this fear

frankly some responses to this thread are a upsetting, the ones that come from people who doesn't have skin in the game and yet are dismissive of this fear/cost/sacrifice"

"@dream_king 1/

good q, I don't think there's one definition everyone agrees on

here are elements I see &amp; value in solarpunk:
- valuing family and emphasizing inter-generational impact
- embracing technology to solve problems while also appreciating the problems technology itself can create"
"@dream_king 2/
- appreciation of ecologies, including human ones
- plants, trees, &amp; flowers everywhere!

"@dream_king 3/

some also interpret solarpunk as anti-capitalist (e.g. https://t.co/00DSiPe1An), but I don't see it that way

I see it as more about integrating externalities into the way we think and act, which is actually very capitalistic but just not in the way we think about it today"
"@nasjaq__ was thinking about this more today (https://t.co/wOC4r5YxMA) &amp; it hit me:

I interpret solarpunk as a critique of capitalism, but not that we should tear it down.  instead, we should reform it to better integrate externalities into incentive structures

curious if that resonates!"
@nasjaq__ in a way, a push to integrate externalities actually *more* capitalist.  it's a way of saying "incentives are important, and our current incentives don't take a lot of important effects into account"

new post!  urban density is a tragedy of the commons: https://t.co/SexhmmJgXa
"people aim to maximize both space &amp; access to amenities when deciding where to live

but there's a tradeoff‚Äîhigh population density increases the quantity &amp; diversity of services a neighborhood can support, but it also requires homes to occupy less land on average https://t.co/njYc0XKAfu"
"so what?  can't we each individually just decide how we want to balance access &amp; space?

unfortunately it's not that simple.  your neighbors' decisions shape the options available to you, and they all want a bigger home too https://t.co/P9S2BHeq6c"
"the aggregation of everyone's preference for more space leads to an undersupply of dense urban neighborhoods

this happens even in cases where everyone in the neighborhood wishes it were more urban!

let's build intuition for why this is true:"
"imagine you're looking to move to a neighborhood where everyone lives in a tightly-packed apartments with bodegas on the ground floor.  magically, you find a mansion that's 10x bigger and fits in your budget!

I don't know about you, but I'd snatch it up instantly https://t.co/AAGVEa43Tj"
"great for you, but now imagine everyone else gets a mansion too‚Äîif every home in a city was a mansion, it wouldn't be a city; it would be a suburb

put another way, each of us tends to choose a larger homes than we want our neighbors to choose"
"of course most people can't afford a mansion, but they will always want as much space as they can get

financial constraints keep this dynamic from spiraling out, but at the margin there's constant pressure towards sprawl

the result: an undersupply of urban neighborhoods https://t.co/f3Cc9HfzKD"
the good/bad news is we're far from the efficient frontier of access vs space tradeoff.  most cities currently make terrible use of space! https://t.co/UGoOvSjujA
"there are so many ways we could increase access to without sacrificing space

for example, we could take Tokyo's lead and replace on-street parking with vertical garages.  we'd lots more space on the street for other things, without even sacrificing a single parking space! https://t.co/LoulMJ5GI8"

"1/ countless immigrant friends have told me they make an order of magnitude more money in the US than they could've in their home country

many had to save up for months/years to buy a plane ticket.  but as soon as they landed, they often made up the price of the ticket in weeks"
"2/ such a huge inefficiency!  upfront capital constraints held them back from being far more productive sooner

are there any platforms for lending to immigrants to buy flights to their destination country?"
"3/ two ideas for how to structure it:
1. conventional loan with principal + interest
2. Income Share Agreement (ISA), where the funder finances the ticket in exchange for X% of their first N years of income, but only if it's more than they were making in their home country"
4/ I'm partial to the ISA structure, because it aligns the interests of the lender even more closely to the immigrant.  now, they are motivated to help the immigrant find the best possible job and education so they can make the most income!
5/ there¬†are a lot of challenges with this idea of course.  I don't pretend to have them sorted out.  this could be rife for abuse on both sides, so it would have to be designed *extremely* carefully
"6/ here are a few problems that would need to be solved, among others:
- how do you verify and score the ""creditworthiness"" of the immigrant?
- how does the financial structure vary for immigrants with different earning potential?"
"7/
- how do you make sure the immigrant has a chance to settle down and look for the best opportunities, rather than letting the lender bully them into a local maximum right when they land just because they want to get paid as soon as possible?"

@dbreunig 2. platform to connect immigrants already in the country to those trying to immigrate, i.e. lenders fund people in a similar position to the one they were in not long ago.  in theory, this increases empathy for the new immigrant's challenges ‚Üí improves the lenders' behavior

one Argentinian grandma I know bought Bitcoin many years ago, even though she barely uses a computer. ""money the government can't touch?!  count me in!"""
Americans (myself included) underestimate this value prop, because we've (generally) been able trust our central bankers to keep our currency stable and predictable
we are wrong to think this is guaranteed.  I don't expect Argentina-level inflation in the US, but having an alternative is a valuable insurance policy
"the big question for me then is: when monetary authorities do prove to be incompetent/corrupt, how can we transition the economy to decentralized money?

how do we make it as easy to pay with BTC/ETH/USDC in Turkey/Venezuela/Argentina as it is to pay with the local currency?"

"wearing a sling has a social purpose that can be as important as its medical purpose

it signals that your arm is injured so that others (a) don't accidentally bump into it and (b) understand why you're so darn slow at doing everything"
what I mean by "self-referential": right now, most excitement for crypto products is predicated on the appreciation of crypto itself, rather on something that people value independently from crypto
"to be clear, I'm already sold on decentralized currency as insurance against incompetent/malicious monetary authorities: https://t.co/CiVOPXzQce

the question I'm pondering is focused on higher-order applications of crypto (dapps, governance, NFTs, etc)"
"it's weird that I *feel* so strongly that there must be compelling blockchain applications beyond decentralized currency, yet I don't actually have an example 
    
it's possible I'm missing something, or that it's still early.  I'm just surprised I haven't come across it yet"
"several examples that come close, and may be a bigger deal than I realize:

1Ô∏è‚É£ DAO formation is much easier than LLC/C-Corp formation.  in theory, you can spin up a team as easily as an AWS instance"
reducing the activation energy for working towards a common goal may be seriously valuable!  this may be especially valuable as a replacement for traditional entities that are wrapped in miles of red tape, e.g. 501(c)(3) organizations
"that said, I don't see why this value prop needs decentralization.  why not just spin up a Discord server?

DAOs give you some stuff for free (place to keep shared funds, whatever you encode in a smart contract) but also extra headaches (unclear legal status, key management, etc)"
we'll have to see how the regulatory environment evolves.  over time DAOs may become subject to as much paperwork as normal entity formation, diminishing the "as easy to spin up as an AWS instance" value prop
"if regulation does pile on, decentralization may be an important way to evade the law, similar to how torrenting evolved as a response to Napster's fall: https://t.co/xKh4eZGDJ7 h/t @backus

but if that happens, DAOs will remain niche due to difficult UX + questionable legality"
"2Ô∏è‚É£ the cryptographic fog of war in @darkforest_eth is super cool

although decentralization and trustlessness don't seem *necessary* for something so low-stakes (I'm fine with trusting a game developer to keep players' secrets), I see how:"
"(A) these properties may matter a lot for a game with high stakes where you want to ensure the referee/host isn't fixing the match

(B) cryptographic fog of war is a cool primitive that could be used elsewhere (though I haven't thought of other applications yet... lmk if you do!)"
"3Ô∏è‚É£ I kind of see the appeal of NFTs ‚Äî e.g. I'd be thrilled to buy an NFT of the first concert I went to

but I also suspect that the vast majority of excitement for NFTs is based on the perception that their $ value only seems to go up (+ maybe money laundering?)"
"what happens if NFT valuations stop skyrocketing?  how much of that enthusiasm remains?

I'm sure some people truly do value their NFTs (much like how I'd cherish an NFT of my first concert), but it's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked üôÉ"
"4Ô∏è‚É£ in DeFi, I'm seeing some cool innovations, &amp; on some dimensions ease of use blows traditional finance out of the water

but it seems the vast majority of use is predicated on speculation rather than financing things we haven't seen before, which is what I'm more excited about"
"maybe this is enough‚Äîdecentralized money solves a real problem (https://t.co/CiVOPXzQce), &amp; products to help you manage that money are obviously necessary

but my hopes for crypto go beyond just moving money around.  @vitalikbuterin said something similar: https://t.co/Bh8pfk2qkh"
all this said, I'm open-minded and hopeful that non-self-referential applications of crypto can and will exist.  I'm just surprised and disappointed that I haven't seen them yet.  maybe I'm just being impatient!
so what am I missing?  what are y'all seeing in the wild that's interesting in its own right, even when the tokens don't appreciate?

"@thiago_sjc @ensdomains I'm a big fan of ENS, but I don't consider it an example of what I'm asking about

this misses the fact that trusting relationships are crucial to achieving great things!

"@aburisotto yes that's definitely true, and definitely a bad consequence of this reality ‚òπÔ∏è

that falls into the ""the fact the world works this way creates problems too"" category I mentioned, and it's something we should build systems to adjust for"

@rodovich oh yeah of course, but I still think it's a relevant comparison.  I think of it in terms of "what's the most likely reason I might die this year?"

it was actually an intentional comparison!  I think of it in terms of ""what's the most likely reason I might die this year?"" &amp; if you frame it that way, they're the same units"
@diviacaroline 2/  also the more kids you have, the more comparable the cumulative lifetime risks become.  the whole discussion is about increasing the birthrate, and one way to do that is by increasing children per mother

@TLiterarian @ebruenig @VitalikButerin @DeepCipher @shl @elonmusk "fine" is a relative term!  there are plenty of things women I know have gone through as a result of giving birth that we just accept as normal, but in any other circumstance we would consider serious health problems.

lenders rely on legible characteristics like credit ratings, biasing them towards major chains

but developers have local knowledge that small merchants are often better tenants... https://t.co/L35j4xixWT"

compared to large chains, small local merchants are:
- more likely to participate in marketing the shopping center
- less likely to pressure the developer during lease negotiations
- more stable as a group bc any one leaving won't bring down the entire shopping center"

@kevinakwok Interesting! Can you unpack that? Not sure I follow
@kevinakwok Right, that makes sense. But renters still want to get a good deal. I see how that is not as strong of a motivation, but the end goal of getting a cheaper price for the same quality remains the same, right?
@wrycountenance Yes, I made a broad generalization. I also looked up price per sqft at times. I'm fairly confident that it's less common among renters then buyers however
@wrycountenance Re the categorization, that's true for rentals but it's also true for homes that are for sale, so it doesn't account for the difference
Most compelling answer I can think of so far: renting just isn't as important a decision as buying. Renting is typically just a 1yr lease while buying ties you to the asset until you can sell. As a result, you just don't take the decision as seriously &amp; thus look at fewer stats

The main downside I see so far is that the Cruise cars are INCREDIBLY cautious. For example they stop for 3 full seconds at stop signs, and sometimes longer, for no apparent reason. As a result, they are noticeably slower than a human driver

"The saga of Israeli water management is one of the most inspiring stories of the last 75 years

Israel went from having a serious water problem to being a net water exporter to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, the population grew from ~1 million to well over 9 million https://t.co/XJFrWZF43e"
"With its land mass 60% desert, the region was originally thought to support a max population of just 2 million people

But with tireless work, financial support to find new solutions, and brilliant technological advances, Israel was able to blow past those limits https://t.co/vxHIFBA1dW"
"There was no one silver bullet. Israel's water crisis was averted through a portfolio approach. The country invested in a wide range of solutions of varying cost, timelines, and chance of success

Here are a few breakthroughs that were especially powerful:"
"1) Israeli engineers invented drip irrigation in the 1960s, replacing traditional flood irrigation

This method saves up to 90% of the water and boosts yields 10-90% (depending on crop type), because it controls water application to match the exact needs of each plant https://t.co/EB5LLRqwx6"
"2) Israel played a huge role in proving that desalination can be economically viable

The country desalinates 75% of its drinking water from the Mediterranean, and it has built some of the largest and most advanced desalination plants in the world https://t.co/ZGddCJBWYw"
"3) Wastewater reuse is a large and growing source of water in Israel, accounting for &gt;25% of the country's water supply

They reuse 90% of their sewage for agricultural irrigation; for comparison, the US reuses &lt;10% https://t.co/vhLctYJEUd https://t.co/qy6zR6aRil"
4) Improved crop varieties: Israeli agricultural scientists have developed new crop varieties that are more resistant to heat, drought, and saline conditions https://t.co/7LrmQZieEq
"5) Real pricing: Most countries subsidize water. For a long time, Israel was no exception. But in 2009, they started charging people for the real price of the water they consumed

Without rationing or limiting supply, real pricing induced households to cut water use by 16%! https://t.co/4EBPTmIaVL"

I'm sad to announce that I will have to shut off Small World soon, because Twitter changed its pricing such it would cost $42,000/month to keep the tool up and running üò¢ https://t.co/iADrPgAXvd
I really love Twitter ‚Äì I've found friendships, work opportunities, and even romantic relationships on here! ‚Äì and I built Small World to help other people who hit it off on Twitter to connect offline too
I've been paying the hosting fees out of pocket (with the support of some amazing GitHub Sponsors üíï) as a way of paying it forward to the Twitter community that has given me so much. But this new pricing is multiple orders of magnitude more than I can afford
This decision to price hobbyists out of the API is heartbreaking, especially in context of the other recent changes Twitter that are eroding this amazing place. I was so excited when @elonmusk bought Twitter, but I've just been disappointed repeatedly. This is the cherry on top
"Silver lining: Small World won't shut down yet. When I emailed Twitter's team, they didn't yet know when the new pricing will come into effect

I'm shocked that they announced such a harsh change without such a key detail, but at least Small World will live a little while longer!"
"I hope that there's a new way for people who hit it off on Twitter to connect offline too, even if it's not with Small World

Heck, maybe Twitter will build a map into the core product! I'd prefer an open platform, but adding a spatial dimension would at least be a step forward"
@chaodoze Thanks for the pointer! Unfortunately Enterprise is the only tier that includes the user profile endpoint that Small World needs
@chaodoze @StanfordReview @Affirm @github @NotionHQ Hmm interesting! When I emailed the Twitter team, they told me this wouldn't work, but I didn't actually try it myself... maybe they haven't shut it off yet? Or maybe it will actually just work anyways? Either way, glad you're suggesting it!
@klabianco Good thing @devon_dos is coming with me too!
@realBobbyHealy I didn't realize that you lived there, awesome! What brought you to CDMX?
"@eshear Thanks for the words of support Emmett, I'm so glad you've enjoyed Small World

From emailing with the Twitter team, the reason the fees are so high is because Small World needs access to the follower graph endpoint, which isn't included in the $100/month or $5k/month tiers"
@shisha_de Sorry to hear you're experiencing a bug! Can you include a screenshot or screencap so I can get a better sense of what you're talking about?
@geoffreylitt I'm so glad that you like it Geoffrey! My secret hope is that they just forget to shut off my v1 API access and I can keep Small World up in definitely

@jiceman Just checked Small World's metrics, and a ton of people have signed up in the last 12 hours, so it might be that the server or database is struggling to handle the load
@grantguske @eshear I don't think any reasonable price would come close to covering the costs. How much would you be willing to pay?

"Some context might be helpful:

In Buenos Aires, protesters have learned that one way to get what they want is to block highways, train lines, buses, etc

This freezes the entire transport network, leaving a city of 16 million unable to get to work, school, hospitals, etc"
"It essentially amounts to blackmail: 
""If you don't (for example) raise the wages for this small group of 50 of us, we will make it impossible for the other 16,000,000 who live in BsAs to get to work"""
"If it were an infrequent occurrence, a tool only used to protest serious injustices, that would be one thing

But the problem is that protesters have learned that shutting down transport networks is an effective threat"
"Having learned that, they have come to use these transport blockages for small, localized demands too (e.g. wage increases at a specific employer)

As a result the transport network in BsAs is often frozen on random days multiple times a month, if not more"
"Long story short: the harm small protester groups were causing by freezing the transport network were way out of proportion to their demands

Milei's solution is not perfect, but it's far from ""suppressing protests"". It's simply stopping them from holding a whole city hostage!"

"It's amazing how much prep makes a difference, even if it's just drafting a quick agenda/qs + starting a blank notes doc

Sometimes I think ""this is a chill 1:1, is it really necessary?"" but then if I spend even 3 mins on it, I think of a bunch of things I wouldn't have otherwise"

- Their landholdings already include water rights that can supply much of the water

(cont.) https://t.co/SWeYNRjHPZ https://t.co/WC6YB6WlJu"
"- California has a robust market for water rights, &amp; urban uses are more than capable of paying the price to ensure access
- Finally, securing adequate water supply is a legal requirement, so they won't be allowed to build without a plan for water that satisfies state regulators https://t.co/jGImZKBHT9"

"I really like Courtyard Homes as a housing typology

Like townhomes, they create a continuous street wall, creating a sense of enclosure for pedestrians

The advantage is each home also gets outdoor space &amp; natural light, avoiding usual downsides of shared walls https://t.co/Y7MXYZ4tba"
"Courtyards work especially well in warm climates, where these outdoor ""rooms"" become an extension of indoor living

This format provides a nice balance of relative density &amp; access to fresh air, &amp; it also creates a nice transition from the public realm into private spaces https://t.co/grjFW93MVI"
It's also a flexible format ‚Äî courtyards can have lush gardens, built-in BBQs, bocce ball courts, small pools... or really anything else you can dream up! https://t.co/N9YbYDbbHV https://t.co/I02EWlmQTw
@GolerGkA The "continuous street wall" is the effect it creates on the outside, not the inside
@GolerGkA Nope, the courtyard is a private space within the home. The interface between the buildings &amp; the street are what create the "continuous street wall", i.e. not pictured in this image
I wish there were a @Shazam for scents
"@bsansouci @paulg Ooh fascinating, I'd love to hear more too!

I've never lived in a courtyard home, so I'm sure there are lots of practicalities I'm not thinking about

Reality is surprisingly detailed..."

"Townhomes typically achieve this ""continuous street wall"" by simply building up to the edge of the street

This is a great format, but the downside is that they often lack outdoor space, &amp; they may not get much natural light, especially if the lot is deep https://t.co/Qhv1qo24Mm"
Here are some photos from Alys Beach &amp; Las Catalinas that show courtyard walls that effectively create a continuous street edge: https://t.co/uP7bAiFzgH
"There are plenty of other ways to create continuous street walls, too

For example, beautiful I'On, SC was required to have setbacks between homes

"People are often willing to pay more to live in walkable, mixed-use communities

I knew this intuitively, but I wanted to understand:
1. Just how big is this premium?
2. How quickly does it set in?

So I dove into the data, &amp; what I found blew me away

https://t.co/QfGKNEpbje"
"Question 1:  How big is this premium?

Methodology: I compared home sale prices in places like @AlysBeach @Serenbe @SeabrookWA &amp; @LasCatalinas to prices in their underlying markets

The average premium in these communities is DOUBLE their surrounding markets! https://t.co/43eyYcrB6K https://t.co/ACYroV7GmR"
"@AlysBeach @serenbe @SeabrookWA @LasCatalinas Question 2:  How quickly does the premium set in?

Yet we don't build enough to meet demand, so they're expensive! https://t.co/6d9Q3slS8T"
@VincentGGraham Very true. Far fewer people would choose to live in the suburbs if they had to pay the full cost of that lifestyle
@ObePraisegod @LasCatalinas There is a parking lot on the edge of Las Catalinas. Because the village is long &amp; thin, no buildings are very far from the parking lot. Also there are golf carts if you need to lug anything from your car to your home

 Memex: My personal knowledge base


May 16th, 2018
Epistemic status: This is a quick write up of my personal experience using Evernote as a PKB. The ideas/processes mentioned in here might work for others too, but I'm not prescribing them! There may be something that would work even better for you, and perhaps for me for that matter. (If you have suggestions please do tell me 🙂)

Epistemic effort: I wrote up an email response to Nick quickly, and then I went back through it once to make sure nothing was totally impossible to understand. Then I turned it into a blog post, because I realized I'd written a lot and might as well share it. This involved a tiny bit of tweaking and formatting. Overall took about 1h to write, so not a masterpiece. Just some fun, barely-filtered thoughts that might be useful to you.

I was emailing back and forth with Nick Nikolov, and he asked me about how I structure my personal knowledge system. The glorious Liz Voeller had just asked me a similar question over coffee earlier that day, so I figured I might as well share the (slightly tweaked) answer.
It's a little hard to nail down any hard-and-fast rules, but here's a rough outline of my process. Unless otherwise noted, all of this lives inside of Evernote.


# Weekly scratchpad 

Each week I have a top-level note titled "★ Scratchpad — Week of DD Mo YYYY". This is kind of a "table of contents" for the week, and its where I list my priorities, tasks, and things to read, and at the bottom of the post I have a bunch of bullet points of random thoughts I want to jot down. These thoughts sometimes turn into bigger notes, at which point I extract them into their own note and link them there. 

The structure of my Scratchpad evolves a tiny bit each day/week, so if you looked back through these Scratchpads and the notes they link to you'd see a gradual shift in approach. The way I was doing it 1y ago was almost totally different.

I used to be obsessive about storing tasks as highly structured data in various task management tools, but then I realized it was taking far more effort to maintain and worry about edge cases than value it was adding. Plus, once you complete a task you don't really care about the data anymore. Plaintext checkbox lists do a plenty good job, and they're cheap. (And they're still pretty easy to refer back to afterwards anyways!)

Having a consistent format for the title is useful for the not-so-infrequent times I want to be able to look back at a note and put it in context with the other Scratchpads. The ★ makes it really easy to find, which is useful because this note is the one I refer back to most frequently. I've started using emoji in other notes I want to have stand out, which is really useful (and fun!). You can see some of my titles here as an example:
# Tables of contents

I often have "tables of contents" for other things besides just my weeks, especially for complex projects that span multiple weeks. The "🕹 Plan for Stu Card interview editing" note is a good example of this. It's an interview video I shot a few weeks back that has lots of different people involved, lots of steps, and lots of documents/files with many versions, so this note helps me keep a holistic view but also to dive into the details when I need to. Another example is my "wtd" note, which stands for "want to do". It's basically a list of bucket lists, like projects, weekend activities, books, restaurants, movies, etc that I want to do at some point. Somehow it only ever grows longer, even as I tick items off the list...


# Clipping 

I clip nearly everything that I read to Evernote, unless I think it was totally useless. I also use Highly for annotating/highlighting things I've read, and then I use the Evernote Web Clipper to grab the highlighted copy to store. This makes referring back to the notes much cheaper, because I've already emphasized the stuff I find useful. Highly's also nice because it automatically shows the highlights on the page when you open the original webpage.

I also obsessively use Evernote's document capturer, which creates what look like really nice scans of paper and text in the real world. It was more useful when I was in school and had lots of math, CS, and physics problem sets that I solved with pen and paper. Here's an example scan from just last week:
# Source of truth

I don't really keep it in sync with other information tools. I keep most of my stuff in Evernote, and for the major exceptions (Github, Notion, Slack, Twitter, email) I've accepted the fact that it's expensive time-wise to worry about that, and I think my intuitive brain overrates how valuable that would be in the first place. This is similar to what I said about task managers before. As a software engineer I feel like it's important for all that stuff to be synced, but in practice this works just fine (with a few exceptions, I'll admit). 

I also do duplicate the most important stuff directly in Evernote, as if it were the source of truth. Particularly long emails (like this one!) are a good category of example; I will usually draft messages in Evernote then transfer them over to email only once they're done. This means I have a record of all the emails I've put thought into directly in Evernote, which also serves as useful fodder for future thoughts/writing.


# Blog

I use Evernote to power my blog, too, which plays a big role in my workflow.

I previously had a custom, self-hosted static site. (I used DocPad, if you're curious.) It felt like the virtuous developer-y thing to do, but it was annoying to add/update posts, and whenever my dependencies would get out of date I'd spend more time managing those, bogging me down from actually publishing content. 

I also briefly used Medium, but that just felt so generic. I couldn't use my own custom domain, and I had no control over the structure of the site. Bleh.

Now, I use Postach.io, which just takes posts from a specific notebook and publishes them to my site. It's dramatically decreased the friction for writing, which is so important. It's also helpful to have my blog CMS in the same place as my more raw notes—they develop in the Scratchpad or extracted notes over time, and then when I realize that they're at a place where they're publishable it's just a matter of cleaning them up a tiny bit, changing the notebook, and marking them with the #published tag. Highly recommend it!#memex

History is too often reduced to stories of good versus evil. We get the impression that we are somehow different from the people who were bad, and we take for granted that we would never make similar choices.

We should learn to empathize with those who make terrible choices — not to pardon their choices nor to deny ourselves the right to grieve, but to recognize when we might be heading down a similar path. If we see them as people and understand where they went wrong, we can avoid making the same mistakes.

 City review: Manchester, England

                  City review: Manchester, England
                  

November 8th, 2018
Update: A few people have criticized my spending only a single Friday night in Manchester. I meant to highlight the fact that that my experience isn't comprehensive, not to imply I think I have some deep understanding of the place after just one short weekend. However I realize it may have come off as the exact opposite.
So to clarify the limited scope of this post: I was in Manchester for a short time, and some specific differences in culture stood out. There is obviously an infinite set of things that I didn't experience that would be at least as interesting and important, I just didn't observe them.

Manchester was a memorable place. The city became famous a few years ago when this Renaissance painting-grade photo went viral:Internet Mancunians (as I learned people from Manchester are called) joked it was a perfect portrayal of the city, which at the time I dismissed as standard, exaggerated self-deprecating humor. I assumed that similar jokes would be made if such a photo had been captured in any town...

Nope. Spending a Friday evening in Manchester quickly disabused me of this notion. I've never seen such widespread, extreme public drunkenness in my life. Of the following episodes, the first 3 happened within minutes of leaving my hotel to grab a late dinner, and the 4th happened shortly after:I should say "within minutes of leaving my hotel room", because it took me a bit longer than usual to leave the building. I went down the stairs to the lobby, at which point my path was blocked by a 50-something British man sprawled on the floor with a Rudolph-red nose and his potbelly hanging out under his shirt. Two hotel employees were bent over, trying to help him get up. He'd passed out at the foot of the stairs, apparently having stumbled on the first step. He called up to me, repeatedly slurring "I'm sorry, so terribly sorry..." as his eyelids drooped disobediently. The hotel staff refused my offer to help and pushed his heavy body to the side to make a path to walk through, and I made it to the door.Having escaped the hotel lobby, I made it no more than a block or two when a rotund middle-aged woman wearing kitten heels staggered up to me. Rummaging around in her purse, she slurred "Hello, erm... hello, could you erm... help me?". I said "Sure, how can I help?", and she stood there for a moment. Then success, she found what she was looking for in her purse! She whipped it out—a cellphone—and asked "Can you help? Hello, miss... erm... is this my cellphone?" Not sure what to say, I stood there and replied "Uh, yeah I think it is!". She asked "Are, are you sure...?", and I said "Pretty sure! Do you need any help getting home?", but instead of responding her eyes just sloped to the ground and she walked away.On my way again. A smashed group of 30-somethings walked ahead of me and kept having to stop to explain to one another where it was they were going. They walked under some construction scaffolding, and one of the men stopped dead, his eyes frozen on the posts holding up the structure, which were padded with a thick foam. He crouched into a boxing position and proceeded to spar with the posts. Uppercut, jab, jab, the a sucker punch! His companion watched on with a dazed look, both blocking everyone else on the sidewalk. Kick, jab, uppercut... victory! Satisfied with his triumph, he signaled to the group that they could continue onwards, and he walked with his chest a bit more puffed out, basking in the glory. He was clearly very proud of himself.After a delicious Ethiopian meal, I walked back home to finally surrender to jet lag. The streets were nearly empty, but again I found myself behind an inebriate. He zigged and zagged along the narrow sidewalk, every once in a while teetering over the short curb into the street into oncoming traffic. I prepared myself to grab the man if his swerving were too poorly timed, but luckily the few passing cars kept a wide berth around the well-oiled pedestrian's sporadic encroachment of their lane. 
Many other folks were extraordinarily drunk as well—I'd dare to say not just many but most adults—but these 4 individuals were particularly memorable. A few more details about Mancunian intoxication:All ages participated in this insobriety, from 18yo clubbers to 50yo pubbers to 80+yo vagrants. No age discrimination in Manchester!Manchester is a fairly multicultural place, with lots of immigrants from Ethiopia, India, the Caribbean, and more, yet the only visibly smashed people I saw on the street white Britons as far as I could tell.It's unclear if they drank far more than what I'm used to seeing or if they were just not very good at holding their alcohol. My guess it's a bit of both. Perhaps more importantly, there was no shame—personal nor schadenfreude—around how publicly smashed everyone was. And I mean everyone was brazenly impaired. In all the places I've lived—including a college campus!—it's embarrassing to be wasted. In Manchester it was quite ordinary.A former manufacturing powerhouse, Manchester has a similar vibe as the dilapidated industrial towns of the Rust Belt. While their American counterparts have responded with depopulation, which brings a quiet melancholy to the streets, Mancunians have responded by getting plastered. They seem to be having a fairly good time, but it's quite horrifying as a visitor.
Besides the drunkenness, a few other distinctive things stood out during my brief stay in Manchester...

Streets and spacesMy favorite place in the city was a quiet, peaceful park called Saint John's Gardens.
Street life was vibrant, with lots of eyes on the street. It wasn't quite my style, but you couldn't say it didn't have personality:
Knew Manchester was famous for its music scene, but I never realized quite how special it is... pic.twitter.com/92CAN2A0EV— Devon ☀️ (@devonzuegel) November 7, 2018

Great underlying street structure, but all of the development in the last 100y appears to be pretty terrible. The core of the town was human-scale and walkable, with small blocks and tightly connected streets (likely remains of its days as Roman fort). But even parts of this old urban skeleton were appropriated for car traffic, and the newer bits of the city beyond the belt road were monotonous and unwelcoming on foot. Goes to show that you can mess up even traditional cities if you try hard enough.

... so much asphalt! 😫Walked around a bit in a neighborhood just outside the core of town, and it suddenly felt like I was in a Guy Ritchie film.Terrifyingly tall buses screeching around corners, like the Knight Bus in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. While I love narrow streets, the tight quarters didn't do any favors for making the traffic less unpleasant. People seemed to drive at roughly the same speeds as in the US (though likely slower, in reality), but it felt much scarier because it was just inches from the sidewalk.Crosswalk waiting times took ages, favoring auto traffic far above pedestrians.
Industrial history in ManchesterWith a short intermission before my train departed to London, I took a quick stroll around the Museum of Science and Industry. Super cool! Manchester was one of the world's principal manufactory cities in the early 19th century, and this museum had a comprehensive set of machines from that era. I had about 15 minutes so only had the chance to skim through a single exhibit. It was called Power Hall, and it displayed a progression of ways to generate power all the way from the early water wheel and horse gin to steam, hot-air, and oil engines.All national museums in Britain are free, which was news to me. I was in the UK for work, otherwise I would've taken advantage of this fact far more. Next time!
Immigration
The immigrants I met were clean cut and well-spoken, which was even more noticeable in contrast to many of the native residents' intoxication. There were exceptions of course, on both sides. Also my brief experience probably selected for the more fortunate immigrants since the most visible ones were those who ran restaurants and small business.I met woman from Uganda in the airport customs line who's getting a PhD in biology at Manchester University and working as a data scientist to make money on the side. The line was very long, so we had a nice conversation about programming languages and how she ended up in Manchester. The fashion aesthetic of most of the immigrants was more subtle than the animal prints: simple but good quality block-color activewear or, for work, tidy button downs.
Relatedly, the range of ethnic food was amazing, and such a wide selection too! I only wish I could have had more meals there...

Misc cultural differences from San Francisco I don't think I've ever seen a woman breastfeeding in public in San Francisco, in part because we don't have very many children (more dogs than children in our topsy turvy city!) but also most mothers choose to do it in private. (Note: Without a kid of my own nor many friends with infants, my epistemic status of this claim re breastfeeding in private is ~60%—please correct me if that doesn't jive with your SF experience!) So I was a bit startled to see a woman with her blouse down to her waist, comfortably double-breasting twin babies in a cafe.
I reflected on my reaction and decided it's probably not a good norm that this is so strange for San Francisco. We'd likely be better off if we were more amenable to public breastfeeding. For one, it would likely be a function of having more babies to begin with (you're less shocked to see breastfeeding if it's happening more often around you), and two it would make would-be parents feel more welcome in the city. I'm sure this aversion to public breastfeeding is not a major factor in couples' parenting decisions, but little cultural quirks like this do add up and are canaries for broader social problems.Perfumed interiors: heavy use of scents inside shops and restaurants. Pretty overpowering.British women love leopard print. Coats, skirts, blouses, lingerie, wallets, headbands... if it exists, the Brits have put leopard print on it. In general the style in Manchester leaned towards busier designs, brighter patterns, and lots more animal prints relative to the US (or SF, at least). Really not my thing, but it was certainly distinctive.All and all Manchester was one of the simultaneously most funny and most depressing places I've been. I expected it to be lifeless and depopulated, but I was wrong. The people watching was extraordinary. I don't have any real desire to go back, but I am curious what it'll look like in another 20 years.

                  Unconventional strategies for practicing Spanish
                  

December 26th, 2019
Language skills are highly multi-dimensional*, so while learning a language, it's important to come at it from lots of different directions. Here are some of the tricks I've used to practice Spanish that I haven't heard so many other people use. (They're likely useful for other languages too, of course.)

(1) Translate past writing you've already published in English 
One fun exercise is to take something you wrote in English, translate it to Spanish, ask a friend to proofread for mistakes, and re-publish it. Example

This is a good way to learn domain-specific vocabulary for topics you care about. For example, I think a lot about economics, transportation, and urban planning, but these aren't topics you'll find in top 1,000 word flash card sets or a Duolingo course or most other materials meant for Spanish-language learners. Those materials have to cater to the lowest common denominator of language, teaching vocabulary that's useful to everyone, not your niche interests. By contrast, I obviously have a special interest in learning to express those concepts since I already used them in a non-Spanish context. Translating a piece of writing you yourself wrote is a good forcing function to look up those words in a contextual way. Rather than synthetically building up a list of words that come to mind, this instead is a much more organic way to learn the words you actually use.

Another perk is that if you publish your translation you then are publishing content to the world in that language you're learning. It's good for the Spanish-speaking world, because they get access to content that might never otherwise be translated into Spanish. This is also good for you personally, because it signals that you're interested in learning that language and thus acts as a lighthouse to attract other people who are also interested in that. 

(2) Start a Spanish-speaking Twitter account
I've had lots of fun with my Spanish-speaking Twitter alt account, @devon_dos. With that account, I follow Spanish language accounts and tweet almost exclusively in Spanish. 

Sometimes, these tweets just quote my usual English-language tweets in my primary account and translate what I've already said directly. This is great for the same reason as my first suggestion above—your own tweets are a sort of "found" language, where you're practicing saying things you clearly actually want to say, since you said them already in your native tongue. You already have things you clearly want to be able to say, so you're really learning how to express yourself. One of my biggest problems with most language-learning approaches is that they decontextualize the language you're trying to learn. The result is that you often find yourself not knowing vocabulary about the things that are most important to you because they were never covered in the textbook.

Sometimes, there are topics I'm much more excited about tweeting about in Spanish than in English for some reason, so I go for that and it's fine. (It'd be interesting to look at which topics these tend to correlate too... something something Sapir-Whorf?)

Tweeting and following accounts in Spanish is another approach to the lighthouse theory of the internet. It shows people that this is something you care about and are investing your time in, so more people will come out of the woodwork. It's also so fun to see the people who follow you then crowdsource corrections for you when you make a mistake. Making mistakes is fun when you let people help you improve!

This is also a great method for learning slang, for developing a sense of how people joke around in the particular country's flavor you're targeting, and for following trends. Twitter is much more akin to the kind of language you'll find on the street of a Latin American or Spanish city, compared to your blog which is generally going to be a lot more formal. It's fun to try to incorporate the language patterns of Spanish speakers you follow into your own tweets. Also the contents of your blog are limited to just whatever you could come up with; a well-seeded Twitter feed injects a lot more randomness.

Also, tweeting as I along my language-learning journey has also served as a fun sort of diary for tracking what I've learned. For example, I tweet/retweet things I learn about the language. It also serves as a nice archive of little tricks I've learned so I can find them again later, in case I've forgotten them.

Aprendí a poner un acento rápidamente en una Mac!Option ⌥ + E, y después cualquier vocal que querés acentuar. pic.twitter.com/IUbaV4ZQZN— Devon número dos ☀️ (@devon_dos) September 22, 2019Finally, tweets are very un-intimidating because they're so small. So it's easy to convince yourself to just tweet once a day, or once a week, or whatever cadence you want to get just a little bit of practice every day.

(3) Rewatch your favorite kids movies in Spanish
My writing of this post is appropriately timed with the recent launch of Disney Plus. Because I'm already familiar with the stories in my favorite childhood movies, they're much more accessible than some artsy film might be. These are also often movies that I miss and haven't seen in a long time but won't otherwise take an evening to re-watch, so it's a good excuse to revisit your favorite movies from childhood. Disney movies are particularly good because they tend to have really high quality dubbing, with a different voice actor for each character rather than just a single voice for the whole show, which is standard.

One tip: I find it's useful to have subtitles in Spanish while watching a movie with Spanish audio dubbing, because even though I understand most of what's going on in the movie, it can be challenging to parse words every once in a while.

(4) Set up a quick-access translator app
One tool I've found really helpful is getting the Intelligent Translator in my Mac menu bar. It's much faster than continuously opening Google Translate tabs, dramatically reducing the friction for looking anything up. 

This means that not only can you translate words you read or sentences you're trying to say but are stuck on faster, but also that it means you're more likely to look things up in the first place and try more challenging language tasks. For example, I now feel more comfortable reading tweets and articles in Spanish because I know it'll only take a moment to look up an unfamiliar word, whereas before it was more of a slog. And sometimes I have a strike if fancy where I think things like "Huh I wonder how you'd say 'saffron' in Spanish" or some other random concept that pops into my head, and it's just a keystroke away to fulfill that whim.

The ergonomics of the app are quite good. I have a custom hotkey to open it from any other app (CMD+SHIFT+W to toggle to toggle the menu popup) and another to translate to translate my highlighted cursor selection (CTRL+CMD+C). It also immediately translates everything on your clipboard and displays a small preview in the menu bar, if you set it to.


(5) Opt for e-books rather than physical ones
I have a special place in my heart for dead-tree books, but an ebook is a godsend when learning a foreign language. It's easy to select a word or phrase and use the lookup function to quickly get a translation, compared to having to pull out a dictionary or translation app every time you get stuck.(6) Subscribe to Spanish language podcasts and YouTube channels 
I've had a bit of a hard time finding many good podcasts and YouTube channels in Spanish. There is lots of language learning content, but much of it runs into the same problems as textbooks, where they focus on boring topics rather than contextualized topics you actually care about. When I listen to most of these shows, my only interest in them is that they're in intermediate Spanish and thus something I'll actually have a chance of understanding, but otherwise I'm uninterested in their content. Unfortunately this means that I get bored quickly and zone out, which reduces their effectiveness.

However, podcasts and YouTube channels are a good source of practice for understand informal uses of language, which for me is more difficult to parse than more regularized, formal audio samples like audiobooks. So despite having a hard time finding great content to consume, I've been determined to keep looking.

From searching for a while, I've found a few shows that are actually quite interesting in their own right, while still being simple enough for me to follow along for the most part. Here are a few podcasts I've found, which may be more interesting for you:
Duolingo Spanish PodcastCatástrofe ultravioletaCosas de InternetEconomía directa Entiende tu MenteTripeando: Conocimiento Colectivo Voces Emprendedoras

And here are a few YouTube channels in Spanish I've found somewhat interesting to play in the background while I'm doing paperwork-type tasks:NekojitablogHarry Potter audiobookMe Llamo NathanJapanistic

I wouldn't say any of these are among my favorite podcasts or channels overall, but they're interesting enough if you're looking for something in Spanish. If you have additional recommendations, please do let me know!

(7) Use spaced repetition 
Spaced repetition is a useful tool for embedding vocabulary and phrases deep into your brain so it can't get dislodged. An example where this has been especially useful for me: while I already know that "mucho gusto" is what you'd say as a greeting when you meet someone for the first time, my retrieval is pretty slow in the moment when I actually need to say it, and in those social interactions, pacing is everything. If you don't get out the proper greeting in the right moment, you've generally lost your chance and the conversation has moved on. As a result, I've added that phrase to my spaced repetition flashcard deck so that I have it on the tip of my tongue in the moments where I need it.

I also try to put every cool phrase I come across that I particularly like into spaced repetition deck. In particular, I've added lots of Argentinian idioms into my deck. That way I can deploy them in appropriate moments and surprise everyone.

I must say that flashcards are my least favorite method I'm suggesting here, though they do have their uses. Flash cards decontextualize words, which as you can tell from above I'm not a huge fan of. However, they are incredibly helpful for getting key vocabulary on the tip of your tongue at the right moment, which can do wonders for increasing your reaction velocity and confidence in conversations. So I recommend flash cards less for learning new words and more for imprinting the ones you already know and simply want faster retrieval for into your mind.

None of the spaced repetition apps are great, so here are a few that I've tried and are "just fine":Quizlet (this is the one I currently use) Studies Anki


(8) Word of the Day newsletters 
To get a little injection of new vocabulary into my day, I'm subscribed to a Spanish Word of the Day newsletter. It blends into all my other threads pouring into my inbox, so I don't have to exercise additional self control to go look up a new word each day. This means that every day I learn at least one new word in Spanish, even if I forget or don't have time to do any other practice.

(9) Change your phone's system language to Spanish

My key fluency goal is to be so comfortable in Spanish that I don't even think about the fact I'm using it. While it felt very odd to see all of my phone's menus in Spanish at first, I use my phone so frequently that it quickly faded into the background and I now have very little problem with understanding the UI. (It's also an interesting exercise in seeing which parts of the UX are intuitive on their own without labels, and which ones I'm more dependent on the labels for.)

I still haven't changed my system language on my laptop, because I do far more complex tasks there and view many more different UIs, whereas the set of apps and the flexibility of the OS on my phone is more limited. Also I do actual work there, where I don't want my discomfort with the language to get in the way of getting my work done. Maybe one day I'll give it a try though.

(10) Build muscle memory for typing accented characters 
This isn't exactly to learn Spanish, but it makes it easier to type in Spanish: learn the hotkeys for the Spanish characters!
ñ — Option + n, ná — Option + e, aé — Option + e, eí — Option + e, ió — Option + e, oú — Option + e, uü — Option + u, uinverted question mark (¿) — Shift + Option + ?inverted exclamation point (¡) — Option + 1left angle quote («) — Option + \right angle quote (») — Shift + Option + \

(11) It is fine to fill in the gaps with English and Spanglish
My instinct when I don't know a particular word in Spanish is to stop dead in my tracks and ask what the proper word is. Instead, I've learned it's more fun and practical to override that instinct and instead just power through and take my best guess. This is a great source of entertainment for everyone, and I'm constantly surprised by how frequently I hit upon the actually correct word (or at least something close to it) when I thought I was just taking a wild guess. 

For example, yesterday I was talking about the word "despegar", which means "to take off", and I asked "despegar como un rockete?". "Rockete" is not the word for rocket—the proper word would've been "cohete"—but it could've been, and it was a good enough guess that my speaking partner could correct me quickly and teach me the right word. (Also apparently it was hilarious.)

The general pattern I use is to first say a sentence fully with the guess word in place of the vocabulary I'm not sure of, then to make a facial expression to my conversational partner to indicate that I'm not confident of what I just said. The facial expression is shorthand for "I realize the sentence I just said may be extremely confusing, so please correct me if I'm wrong... and if I said it coherently, please give me positive reinforcement so I know I can keep going."

(12) Date an Argentinian
The single biggest piece of advice I can give is to start dating someone whose first language is Spanish. (Though I suppose this is easier said than done. 😋)  I studied Spanish in school for years, but my comprehension, verbal skills, and confidence with the language grew an order of magnitude faster as soon as I met my boyfriend, who grew up in Buenos Aires. 

I learned more Spanish in the first few months we dated than in the half decade I studied it in school, including the summer I lived in Panama. Now that I'm with him, I am far more motivated, our conversations are contextual, and I feel even more comfortable than usual at being a beginner because I'm with someone I trust.

There is no greater motivation to learn a language than wanting to impress your boyfriend's parents. His family lives in Argentina, and it's very important to me that I can communicate with them in their native tongue. I can't exactly explain why—they all speak English so it's not like I wouldn't be able to communicate with them at all—but it feels like an important sign of respect, and I want to be able to participate fully in their family and social life when we visit. This winter I'll be back for my second visit, and I'm really looking forward to seeing their reactions when they see how much my Spanish has improved. 😊

Another benefit is similar to the contextual nature of the first two suggestions here—when I speak with my boyfriend in Spanish around the house, our conversations are about real things that I actually care about, rather than an artificial set of words compiled in a textbook trying to take a stab at what topics will be useful to the greatest number of people. 

Also, the language I use with him is situated in space, so I can associate words in a sort of memory palace. My language use is now grounded in the physical world as we go around daily life, instead of learning new vocabulary in a classroom, severed from the environment where they're used. For example, I re-learned the word for "fork"—"tenedor", which I always had a hard time remember in school—while we were in the kitchen while I was holding an actual fork in my hand. This etched a much deeper pathway in my mind for that word than when I saw it on a vocabulary sheet printed out by my high school Spanish teacher. (Or at least that's how it feels... I'm not actually sure of the cognitive science here.)

Finally, it's incredible what a difference it makes to learn a language with someone you deeply trust and who can simulate your speech patterns and mental models well. He understands my Spanish better than most other people, and he can simulate where I'm likely to get lost and give me some assistance. It's interesting to see how wide a range there is on this front when talking to different people. It's particularly stark between talking to native Spanish speakers who have done exchange programs abroad where they had to learn a new language, and to native Spanish speakers who don't have the personal experience of being throttled on your ability to express themself. The former group has a lot more empathy and can better predict where you might get stuck. Now that I have had more of that experience, I'd like to think that I've also improved on my ability to speak with English language learners.

July 26, 2010  By Venkatesh Rao 
James C. Scott’s fascinating and seminal book, Seeing Like a State: How Certain  Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, examines  how, across dozens of domains, ranging from agriculture and forestry, to  urban  planning and census-taking, a very predictable failure pattern keeps   recurring.  The pictures below, from the book (used with permission from the author) graphically and literally illustrate the central concept in this failure pattern, an idea called "legibility."

States and large organizations exhibit this pattern of behavior most  dramatically, but individuals frequently exhibit it in  their private lives as well.
Along with books like Gareth Morgan’s Images of Organization, Lakoff and Johnson’s Metaphors we Live By,  William Whyte’s The Organization Man and Keith Johnstone’s Impro, this book is one of the anchor texts for this blog. If I ever teach a course on ‘Ribbonfarmesque Thinking,’ all these books would be required reading. Continuing my series on complex and dense books that I cite often, but  are too difficult to review or summarize, here is a quick introduction  to the main idea.The Authoritarian High-Modernist Recipe for Failure
Scott calls the thinking style behind the failure mode "authoritarian high modernism," but as we’ll see, the failure mode is not limited to the brief intellectual reign of high modernism (roughly, the first half of the twentieth century).
Here is the recipe:Look at a complex and confusing  reality, such as the social dynamics of an old cityFail to  understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality worksAttribute that failure to the irrationality of  what you are looking at, rather than your own limitationsCome up  with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality ought to  look likeArgue that the relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of the vision represents rationalityUse authoritarian  power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality if necessaryWatch your rational Utopia fail horriblyThe big mistake in this pattern of failure is projecting your subjective lack of comprehension onto the object you are looking at, as "irrationality." We make this mistake because we are tempted by a desire for legibility.
Legibility and Control
Central to Scott’s thesis is the idea of legibility. He explains how he stumbled across the idea while researching efforts by nation states to settle or "sedentarize" nomads, pastoralists, gypsies and other peoples living non-mainstream lives:
The more I examined these efforts at sedentarization, the more I came to see them as a state’s attempt to make a society legible, to arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion.  Having begun to think in these terms, I began to see legibility as a central problem in statecraft. The pre-modern state was, in many crucial respects, particularly blind; it knew precious little about its subjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields, their location, their very identity. It lacked anything like a detailed "map" of its terrain and its people.
The book is about the 2-3 century long process by which modern states reorganized the societies they governed, to make them more legible to the apparatus of governance. The state is not actually interested in the rich functional structure and complex behavior of the very organic entities that it governs (and indeed, is part of, rather than "above"). It merely views them as resources that must be organized in order to yield optimal returns according to a centralized, narrow, and strictly utilitarian logic. The attempt to maximize returns need not arise from the grasping greed of a predatory state. In fact, the dynamic is most often driven by a genuine desire to improve the lot of the people, on the part of governments with a popular, left-of-center mandate. Hence the subtitle (don’t jump to the conclusion that this is a simplistic anti-big-government conservative/libertarian view though; this failure mode is ideology-neutral, since it arises from a flawed pattern of reasoning rather than values).
The book begins with an early example, "scientific" forestry (illustrated in the picture above). The early modern state, Germany in this case, was only interested in maximizing tax revenues from forestry. This meant that the acreage, yield and market value of a forest had to be measured, and only these obviously relevant variables were comprehended by the statist mental model. Traditional wild and unruly forests were literally illegible to the state surveyor’s eyes, and this gave birth to "scientific" forestry: the gradual transformation of forests with a rich diversity of species growing wildly and randomly into orderly stands of the highest-yielding varieties. The resulting catastrophes — better recognized these days as the problems of monoculture — were inevitable.
The picture is not an exception, and the word "legibility" is not a metaphor; the actual visual/textual sense of the word (as in "readability") is what is meant. The book is full of thought-provoking pictures like this: farmland neatly divided up into squares versus farmland that is confusing to the eye, but conforms to the constraints of local topography, soil quality, and hydrological patterns; rational and unlivable grid-cities like Brasilia, versus chaotic and alive cities like Sao Paolo. This might explain, by the way, why I resonated so strongly with the book.  The name "ribbonfarm" is inspired by the history of the geography of Detroit and its roots in "ribbon farms" (see my About page and the historic picture of Detroit ribbon farms below).

High-modernist (think Bauhaus and Le Corbusier) aesthetics necessarily lead to simplification, since a reality that serves many purposes presents itself as illegible to a vision informed by a singular purpose. Any elements that are non-functional with respect to the singular purpose tend to confuse, and are therefore eliminated during the attempt to "rationalize." The deep failure in thinking lies is the mistaken assumption that thriving, successful and functional realities must necessarily be legible. Or at least more legible to the all-seeing statist eye in the sky (many of the pictures in the book are literally aerial views) than to the local, embedded, eye on the ground.
Complex realities turn this logic on its head; it is easier to comprehend the whole by walking among the trees, absorbing the gestalt, and becoming a holographic/fractal part of the forest, than by hovering above it.
This  imposed simplification, in service of legibility to the state’s  eye, makes the rich reality brittle, and failure  follows. The imagined  improvements are not realized. The metaphors of killing the golden goose, and the Procrustean bed come to mind.
The Psychology of Legibility
I suspect that what tempts us into this failure is that legibility quells the anxieties evoked by apparent chaos. There is more than mere stupidity at work.
In Mind Wide Open, Steven Johnson’s entertaining story of his experiences subjecting himself to all sorts of medical scanning technologies, he describes his experience with getting an fMRI scan. Johnson tells the researcher that perhaps they should start by examining his brain’s baseline reaction to meaningless stimuli. He naively suggests a white-noise pattern as the right starter image. The researcher patiently informs him that subjects’ brains tend to go crazy when a white noise (high Shannon entropy) pattern is presented. The brain goes nuts trying to find order in the chaos. Instead, the researcher says, they usually start with something like a black-and-white checkerboard pattern.

If my conjecture is correct, then the High Modernist failure-through-legibility-seeking formula is a large scale effect of the rationalization of the fear of (apparent) chaos.
[Techie aside: Complex realities look like Shannon white noise, but in terms of deeper structure, their Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity is low relative to their Shannon entropy; they are like pseudo-random numbers or π, rather than real random numbers; I wrote a two-part series on this long ago, that I meant to continue, but never did].
The Fertility of the Idea
The idea may seem simple (though it is surprisingly hard to find words to express it succinctly), but it is an extraordinarily fertile one, and helps explain all sorts of things. One of my favorite unexpected examples from the book is the "rationalization" of people names in the Philippines under Spanish rule (I won’t spoil it for you; read the book). In general, any aspect of a complex folkway, in the sense of David Hackett Fischer’s Albion’s Seed, can be made a victim of the high-modernist authoritarian failure formula.
The process doesn’t always lead to unmitigated disaster. In some of the more redeeming examples, there is merely a shift in a balance of power between more global and more local interests. For example, we owe to this high-modernist formula the creation of a systematic, global scheme for measuring time, with sensible time zones. The bewilderingly illegible geography of time in the 18th century, while it served a lot of local purposes very well (and much better than even the best atomic clocks of today), would have made modern global infrastructure, ranging from the railroads (the original driver for temporal discipline in the United States) to airlines and the Internet, impossible. The Napoleanic era saw the spread of the metric system; again an idea that is highly rational from a centralized bird’s eye view, but often stupid with respect to the subtle local adaptions of  the systems it displaced. Again this displaced a good deal of local power and value, and created many injustices and local irrationalities, but the shift brought with it the benefits of improved communication and wide-area commerce.
In all these cases, you could argue that the formula merely replaced a set of locally optimal modes of social organization with a globally optimal one. But that would be missing the point. The reason the formula is generally dangerous, and a  formula for failure, is that it does not operate by a thoughtful consideration of local/global tradeoffs, but through the imposition of a singular view as "best for all" in a pseudo-scientific sense. The high-modernist reformer does not acknowledge (and often genuinely does not understand) that he/she is engineering a shift in optima and power, with costs as well as benefits. Instead, the process is driven by a naive "best for everybody" paternalism, that genuinely intends to improve the lives of the people it affects. The high-modernist reformer is driven by a naive-scientific Utopian vision that does not tolerate dissent, because it believes it is dealing in scientific truths.
The failure pattern is perhaps most evident in urban planning, a domain which seems to attract the worst of these reformers. A generation of planners, inspired by the crazed visions of Le Corbusier, created unlivable urban infrastructure around the world, from Braslia to Chandigarh. These cities end up with deserted empty centers populated only by the government workers forced to live there in misery (there is even a condition known as "Brasilitis" apparently), with slums and shanty towns emerging on the periphery of the planned center; ad hoc, bottom-up, re-humanizing damage control as it were. The book summarizes a very elegant critique of this approach to urban planning, and the true richness of what it displaces, due to Jane Jacobs.
Applying the Idea
Going beyond the book’s own examples, the ideas shed a whole new light on other stories/ideas. Two examples from my own reading should suffice.
The first is a book I read several years back, by Nicholas Dirks, Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India, which made the argument (originally proposed by the orientalist Bernard Cohn), that caste in the sense of the highly rigid and oppressive, 4-varna scheme was the result of the British failing to understand a complex social reality, and imposing on it their own simplistic understanding of it (the British Raj is sometimes called the "anthropological state" due to the obsessive care it took to document, codify and re-impose as a simplified, rigidified, Procrustean prescription, the social structure of pre-colonial India).  The argument of the book — obviously one that appeals to Indians (we like to blame the British or Islam when we can) — is that the original reality was a complex, functional social scheme, which the British turned into a rigid and oppressive machine by attempting to make it legible and governable. While I still don’t know whether the argument is justified, and whether the caste system before the British was as benevolent as the most ardent champions of this view make it out to be, the point here is that if it is true, Scott’s failure model would describe it perfectly.
The second example is Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which I am slowly reading right now (I think it is going to be my personal Mount Everest; I expect to summit in 2013). Perhaps no other civilization, either in antiquity or today, was so fond of legible and governable social realities.  I haven’t yet made up my mind, but reading the history through the lens of Scott’s ideas, I think there is  strong case to be made that the fall of the Roman empire was a large-scale instance of the legibility-failure pattern. Like the British 1700 years later, the Romans did try to understand the illegible societies they encountered, but their failure in this effort ultimately led to the fall of the empire.
Aside: if you decide to attempt Mount Everest along with me, take some time to explore the different editions of Gibbon available; I am reading a $0.99 19th century edition on my Kindle — all six volumes with annotations and comments from a decidedly pious — and critical — Christian editor. Sometimes I don’t know why I commit these acts of large-scale intellectual masochism.  The link is to a modern, abridged Penguin edition.
Is the Model Relevant Today?
The phrase "high-modernist authoritarianism" might suggest that the views in this book only apply to those laughably optimistic, high-on-science-and-engineering high modernists of the 1930s. Surely we don’t fail in these dumb ways in our enlightened postmodern times?
Sadly, we do, for four reasons:There is a decades-long time lag between the intellectual high-watermark of an ideology and the last of its effectsThere are large parts of the world, China in particular, where authoritarian high-modernism gets a visa, but postmodernism does notPerhaps most important: though this failure mode is easiest to describe in terms of high-modernist ideology, it is actually a basic failure mode for human thought that is time and ideology neutral. If it is true that the Romans and British managed to fail in these ways, so can the most postmodern Obama types. The language will be different, that’s all.And no, the currently popular "pave the cowpaths" and behavioral-economic "choice architecture" design philosophies do not provide immunity against these failure modes. In fact paving the cowpaths in naive ways is an instance of this failure mode (the way to avoid it would be to choose to not pave certain cowpaths). Choice architecture (described as "Libertarian Paternalism" by its advocates) seems to merely dress up authoritarian high-modernism with a thin coat of caution and empirical experimentation. The basic and dangerous "I am more scientific/rational than thou" paternalism is still the central dogma.[Another Techie aside: For the technologists among you, a quick (and very crude) calibration  point should help: we are talking about the big brother of waterfall  planning here. The psychology is very similar to the urge to  throw legacy software away. In fact Joel Spolsky’s post on the subject Things  You Should Never Do, Part I, reads like a narrower version of  Scott’s arguments. But Scott’s model is much deeper, more robust, more subtly argued, and more broadly applicable.  I haven’t yet thought it through, but I don’t think lean/agile software development can actually mitigate this failure mode anymore than choice architecture can mitigate it in public policy] 
So do yourself a favor and read the book, even if it takes you months to get through. You will elevate your thinking about big questions.
High-Modernist Authoritarianism in Corporate and Personal Life
The application of these ideas in the personal/corporate domains actually interests me the most. Though Scott’s book is set within the context of public policy and governance, you can find exactly the same pattern in individual and corporate behavior. Individuals lacking the capacity for rich introspection apply dumb 12-step formulas to their lives and fail. Corporations: well, read the Gervais Principle series and Images  of Organization. As a point of historical interest, Scott notes that the Soviet planning model, responsible for many spectacular legibility-failures, was derived from corporate Taylorist precedents, which Lenin initially criticized, but later modified and embraced.
Final postscript: these ideas have strongly influenced my book project, and apparently, I’ve been thinking about them for a long time without realizing it. A very early post on this blog (I think only a handful of you were around when I posted it), on the Harry Potter series and its relation to my own work in robotics, contains some of these ideas. If I’d read this book before, that post would have been much better.#control

In this episode, we discussed how different communities tackle the question of transportation, and how culture shapes how different transport technologies get adopted.
As usual, the conversation traveled far and wide across the globe. We talked about Bolivian intersections, Japanese trains, French jets, Thai motorbikes, German cars, Swiss crosswalks, and more.

~ ~ ~

Devon (00:00:15): Hello, and welcome to the fourth episode of Order Without Design. I'm Devon, and in this series I get to talk about cities with the most interesting couple I know, Alain and Marie-Agnes. In our last conversation, we talked about sanitation and public health. It included astonishing stories of their experience with these systems, in the dozens of cities where they've lived and worked.
Devon (00:00:36): One highlight was when Alain recounted the time that he had his appendix removed in Yemen, and discovered that the doctor had run out of Novocaine. Anyways, I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you haven't heard that episode I highly recommend it. Today we'll talk about transportation. Since thes have lived and worked in so many cities around the world, they have a broad and deep perspective on the factors that affect how transportation systems function in different contexts.

Devon (00:01:02): So for the first question, some countries are notorious for reckless driving. They treat stop signs as suggestions rather than a rule. The drivers will weave in and out of lanes without signaling. Meanwhile, other countries have a reputation for extremely cautious drivers. What's the cause of this huge difference?

Alain (00:01:20): I think it's not regulations, it is norms. People in some countries, respect rules by tradition, and other do not. The rules of the road, are about the same in  every country. In some countries there is, maybe, a complete distrust of government. I'm thinking of probably one of the worst type of traffic I've seen, is in Egypt. In Cairo,  but also in Egypt, in general. And I think that it comes from a mistrust of government, that everything government does is suspect of corruption.

The streets of Cairo, EgyptA highway in Singapore.
Alain (00:01:59): It could be also that in countries that have been occupied for a long time by foreigners, people have less confidence in government than in countries which have been self-governing. And Egypt, maybe people do not remember that, but the last time Egypt were governed by Egyptians were by the pharaohs before Ptolemies, and then the next time was when Nasser took over from King Farouk, I think, in 1956 or something like that.  King Farouk was imposed by the British in Egypt . And he was originally an Albanian, so he was not an Egyptian.

Alain (00:02:42): So I think that if you are governed by a foreign power, anything you do against the rule of the foreign power is patriotic, and you are encouraged to break the rules. And I think that breaking  driving rules is a bit like that, I think.

Devon (00:02:58): That's super interesting.

Alain (00:03:00): It's a hypothesis, of course, but the long shadow of history, I believe in that. That people have a narrative of history, and they have a certain attitude, again, norms, who are different from regulation. The fact that you respect some regulation or you don't respect them, and if nobody respect them, it's unenforceable. If you bring a cop from Singapore, and you bring him in Cairo, the guy will become nuts within 24 hours because he will not be able to enforce the law, because everybody break the law all the time.

Devon (00:03:33): What if you replace the entire Egyptian police force with Singaporean police force? What do you think would happen then?

Alain (00:03:41): I think you will have to do the opposite. You have to replace the entire driving force of Egypt with Singaporeans, of course you won't have enough Singaporeans, because it's the drivers, really, that make the norms. If you have a policeman who try to enforce a law but he has 100 offenders in 10 minutes, he will not be able to do his job. By the time he writes a ticket, there will be 20 people who have passed the red light without stopping.

Marie-Agnes (00:04:10): You were talking about Singapore was so regulated, and people will obey the law. And one time you were saying if you import a number of foreigners in Singapore and they don't cross when the light is for pedestrians, they cross at any time, it happens in many cities-

Alain (00:04:33): Like you do.

Marie-Agnes (00:04:34): Like I'm doing many times, especially in Switzerland where people are so obeying of the law, and there is no traffic and no one dare to cross the road if the light doesn't come green for the pedestrians. But if you import many people like me in Singapore, the police will be overwhelmed.

Alain (00:04:58): Overwhelmed, yes, yes. Yes, you see that. But that reinforces, again, the point. Look at the countries which are very respectful of law. You could have Switzerland, for instance. You'll have the Scandinavian countries which has never been occupied by other countries. You will have New Zealand, Australia, also. They are very respectful. They're a country which have a tradition to be self-governing.


Alain (00:05:27): So in the US, actually, the US contradicts my theory a bit, because New York is not really respectful. But say, other cities are more. But let's say San Francisco, I think, is more respectful of traffic than ... So I don't know. Maybe in the case of New York it's the very large number of immigrants. I understand, if I remember well, something like 45% of people who live in New York are not born in the US. So most probably, they were born in countries which were they were not self-governing in a traditional way. I don't know, I'm trying to justify my theory.

Devon (00:06:04): It sounds like if you ... According to that theory, then it would predict that the way you learned how to drive, depending on where you were, would then predict how you behaved later. If you learn how to drive in, I don't know, India, which I think has a very, very ... Crazy drivers, then you come to the US, do you think that you would be more likely to have crazy driving norms? Like disrespecting the rules a little bit more? Or do you think we can assimilate quickly into whatever the norms are of the area that you're in?

Alain (00:06:33): I think you assimilate if you're alone. If you learn to drive, if you have your license in Egypt or in India, but for some reason you move to Singapore or Switzerland, I am sure within a week you'll follow the rules because you'll have accumulated so many tickets, because you are the only one to do it.

Alain (00:06:53): And so I think it's not so much how you learn, it's more the practice. Let's say you adapt to the norms of your peers, and if your peers are breaking the law in a way ... That's what an Egyptian taxi driver told me one day, when I asked him, "Why do you go through the red light without stopping?" And he says, "Well, because everybody does it." So you see, it's game theory in a way, that you expect other people to behave in a certain way and you adjust your behavior to the way other people behave.

Egyptian taxis.
Devon (00:07:29): Yeah, I was told a story by one of my friends who was from Argentina, and he spent some time in Bolivia. And he said that in Bolivia, there are a lot of intersections where people don't stop at all. They completely ignore the light, keep going, and they'll just go, go, go. And then, as soon as there's a gap, then the other side will start going and go, go, go. And so everyone gets really stuck because if there's enough traffic, then there's just this constant stream and you can never break through.

Devon (00:07:58): And in that case, I think, I follow the rules pretty carefully when I'm driving in the United States. But if I was in Bolivia and I have to get where I'm going, I think I would probably do the same thing, because otherwise you're just going to be stuck there because you're never going to find that gap at the same time as the green light.

The streets of Bolivia.
Alain (00:08:15): Yes, right. Yeah, so that's game theory. You adjust to what you expect other people to do.

Devon (00:08:21): Let's say, I think Sweden, for instance, or Singapore, both have pretty strict driving norms, and people are very cautious on the street. What would you do? Let's say you wanted to make their norms more dangerous and you wanted people to be more reckless on the road. How would you cause that cultural change?

Alain (00:08:38): I would import five million drivers from Cairo. But you have to do it at the same time. If you import them 10 or 100 at a time, it won't work.

Devon (00:08:47): I see. So if they come in a steady trickle, then they'll get integrated into the local norms?

Alain (00:08:53): Don't forget that also, in Singapore, like also I would say New Zealand or Switzerland, certainly, it's not only the cops who intervene. It's also the people who look at you. In Switzerland, they will say, "Why'd you cross? It's not your turn to cross," because they expect people to follow the rules. And for them, this is a rule.

Alain (00:09:14): And so I think it's enforced also by the population, not necessarily only by the cops. You see everybody standing and looking at you and you feel a little bad, self conscious, so you don't do it any more.

Devon (00:09:27): Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be surprised if the social norms were actually stronger than the policing norms in a lot of places, where you don't do it because you don't want your friends to judge you, more than that you're worried about the police.

Alain (00:09:41): That's right, yeah. Yeah. In a certain way, that's why in the United States, you mow your lawn, and you feel obliged to mow your lawn if the grass is too high. You feel a little self conscious, also, compared to the neighbor. You are very comfortable having tall grass in your yard, but you feel that other people might object ... And you try not to antagonize your neighbors.

Devon (00:10:05): Transportation is a really big part of a culture. I think it's something that's kind of underrated, when people talk about the culture of France or the culture of Japan. They usually talk about the food or the wine, or the way people talk and the language, but I think the way people move around really affects the culture and vibe of the city as well.

Devon (00:10:25): The kinds of interactions that you have with other people are very different if you're in a car versus on a bike, versus on the subway, versus walking around. And you two have lived in a lot of different cities, and worked in even more cities. I'm curious, how does the mix of transit modes impact the culture and vibe a city that you've been in?

Alain (00:10:43): When we arrived in Yemen, I will say that in Sanaa, there were probably 300 or 400 cars, so very, very few cars. Most people would have either motorcycles, and there were not that many either, and then donkeys and camels. But most people in Sanaa would just walk. The city at the time was 80,000 people, and pretty high density, so you could walk.

Sana'a, Yemen.
Alain (00:11:08): There is no doubt that if you are one of the few people with cars, you tend to be a little more ruthless because people fear you. They know that they are going to be hurt more than you, and it give a sense of hierarchy, which is very unhealthy.

Alain (00:11:29): I think also then after that, when people get richer and there are more people having cars, let's say 20% or 30%, which is the case now probably in urban India at least. Then you still have the arrogance of the people with cars, saying that, "I have acquired this car. This is new. This give me a certain power over other people," and the feeling that the roads are designed for cars, the cars have priorities.

Alain (00:11:59): So it give a sense of hierarchy which is very unhealthy. I think that the country which are more middle class and have an older tradition of being rich, that mean the car is not a new thing, probably drive more carefully. When I was in Nepal the first time in 1963, there were no roads between the two main cities, Kathmandu and Pokhara, and people walked the distance. It's about 200 kilometers, if I remember well, between the two cities. And there was a trail, and people were walking. Entire family were walking from one city to another with their luggage.

Alain (00:12:44): A lot of porters, also. They hire a lot of porters. There no animals, because in the mountains there were a lot of staircase which were carved in the rock in the mountain. So it was a country where just everybody walk. And rich people would have porters, and poor people just carry their own load. It give a completely, also, different attitude. I found it very nice, but I was young and very healthy, and liked to hike, so that was fine. Maybe at my age now I would not find it so nice to walk with a load 200 kilometers.

Devon (00:13:19): Maybe you just have to get a porter, then.

Alain (00:13:21): Yes, maybe. I could afford a porter, probably.

Devon (00:13:23): Marie-Agnes, how about you? What cities come to mind as having interesting transportation networks, and how did that affect the culture there?

Marie-Agnes (00:13:30): Yeah, we were living in Thailand. You'd be stuck in traffic for hours without almost moving, and then you realize that you were not alone. Public transport was not too well organized. Most of them were kind of motorbike with three wheels, with some seat on the back. Those one were more flexible, and the most motorbike being not as large as a car, so they would be passing in front of you continuously and squeezing in between lines of car.

Buses, minibuses and taxis share the streets with private vehicles at Ratchadamri Road, Bangkok. Wikipedia
Marie-Agnes (00:14:08): And after then, some time, the city decided to have some bus transportation be organized. And things get a little bit better, but still, the richer people didn't take the public transport. And we were working for a company run by the government, National Housing Authority. And they have the good idea to have an air conditioning bus, very comfortable, so we abandoned our car and took the air conditioning bus. We did not mind riding in the bus and be stuck in the traffic because it was very nice to be in a cool atmosphere and you could read. At that time, we didn't have internet, but I believe now they may have WiFi on the bus and you can start shooting some emails there and there, or reading your email in the bus.

Getting around Bangkok by bus.
Marie-Agnes (00:15:10): Public transport, I should say, is a plus for a city, especially when it's comfortable. I don't see, in New York, unfortunately, me taking the metro or a bus, because they are not as comfortable and you cannot rely too much on the metro. You can, but many time we were ... At one point, living in New York for three months in Manhattan, and we were commuting from the place in Battery Park to NYU, New York University.

Marie-Agnes (00:15:44): And many time, we have to calculate the time traveling, saying instead to take 20 minutes, we'll take close to 45 minutes. Double the time, because subway were not on time. The subway would stop in between station. You were in the dark. So it's the comfort of public transportation is really a necessity for many people, especially for old people like we are.

Devon (00:16:14): Right, yeah, and if you have an option that you can afford, that's more comfortable, then you might as well take that. But then it ends up resulting in more of a separation of different types of people, which is probably unfortunate.

Alain (00:16:25): Yeah. I usually try to take public transport in all the cities I work in, just as an experience and to see. I like to go to the end of the line to see what happens there. Say in some cities like, again, for instance in Seoul or in Beijing or Shanghai, taking the subway is a pleasure. It's kind of comfortable. I remember in Mumbai taking the suburban train, and I could not get out at the stop I was trying to get out because it was so crowded.

Alain (00:16:58): So after that my Indian friend told me, "You have to know, if you take the train, three or four stations before your station, you have already to move closer to the door. If not, you will never be able to exit, and you'll have to take, after, the train in the other direction in order to get to your station."

Alain (00:17:17): So you see that you need an experience like that to ... I think it's useful to always ... I mean, if you are interested in cities, to take public transport sometimes. Not always, but sometime, in order to have experience and most people experience, it give you a very good idea of what the city's like.

Devon (00:17:37): I remember seeing some Tweets about people being quite frustrated, I believe it was with the Board of the MTA in New York, I think. And a bunch of the board members drove to work every day instead of actually using the subway or any of the public transport, which I'm pretty sympathetic to that frustration, because how are you really going to know what the priorities are if you're not using the system?

Alain (00:18:01): Absolutely, yes. Absolutely, yeah.

Devon (00:18:04): So, Marie-Agnes, yesterday you shared with me an article about the 15 minute city idea that the Mayor of Paris is pushing forward. Can you describe that idea? And I'm super curious to hear both of your reactions to that.

Marie-Agnes (00:18:17): Yeah, the Mayor of Paris who get reelected recently, the big program now is to make Paris walkable and have maximum 15 minute from your place you leave, to the place you work, the place you shop, either walking or bicycling. And as you know, cities are not only good like a Club Med, where you do your 15 minutes exercise every day in the morning and 15 minute coming back.

Marie-Agnes (00:18:51): A city, ... And Alain may explain better, it's part of his book, the city is job market. It works if you can go from one part of the city to another within less than an hour. And for Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris, if she wants to implement this kind of program, she will have to make a number of street cyclable or pedestrian, and enlarge the sidewalk or do ... And she started already, do convert some of the main interior of Paris, especially along the Seine River, converted to only pedestrian and bicycle.

Marie-Agnes (00:19:38): And before it was the two side of the Seine was highways, and now of course the Parisian who were living in the center of Paris loved this idea. But that penalized all of the other people who need the car to provide services to the city. So Alain can jump on it and explain more, but a topic of things, Paris is not Rotterdam. It's not Amsterdam, it is much larger, and the cities need good transportation.

The core of Paris is being transformed into a "15-minute city", the idea that every Paris resident should be able to meet their essential needs within a short walk or bike ride. But what does that mean for the people and uses who can't afford price of living in that core and live in Paris' banlieues?
Alain (00:20:16): Yeah, sometimes it's ... The model is usually Amsterdam, or Copenhagen. Amsterdam is 700,000 people, and Copenhagen, depending the way you count, about a million, million and a half. And it's completely flat. The municipality of Paris is two and a half million people, but it's surrounded by suburbs and it's a city of 10 million people.

Alain (00:20:39): So she's the mayor of the two and a half million people who are in the center of the city, very well served by heavily subsidized public transit. The subway of Paris is really pretty good. The station are renewed and redecorated periodically, and so you could have, if you have a job in Paris, and you live in Paris, you probably ... Maybe 15 minutes would be difficult, but say 20 minutes, 25 minutes would be rather common.

Alain (00:21:11): Unfortunately, Paris now, the Paris municipality, that means the constituency of the mayor, is entirely gentrified. She's not saying every Parisian should have 15 minutes trip, she's saying only the people who are in the gentrified area, with a transport system paid at 90% by the French tax payer, should be able to have 15 minutes.

Alain (00:21:39): And of course, even that, it's a luxury. She had this idea that jobs will be created a bit everywhere. Jobs tend to concentrate in some area, and less in others. So when it comes to things like the grocery store or schools, or things like that, yes. And in Paris, they are already well distributed, because they're zoning yo prevent shops to establish whenever they like ... There is no zoning which differentiate residential from commercial in Paris, even for an office building. You can convert a house into an office building, or an office building into a house, or a grocery store, without practically any permit.

Alain (00:22:21): So that's already achieved. What the mayor doesn't seem to understand is that people go to Paris to work, and more and more jobs are in fact outside the municipality of Paris boundary. I think I show that in my book, because that's part of this gentrification. Many companies find that real estate is so expensive in Paris, again, because of the amenities which are there, which are so attractive for people who are rich enough to afford it.

Alain (00:22:52): So many job have moved  outside Paris municipality to the suburbs, where there, of course, they are out of reach from the superb transport within the municipality of Paris. So it's a bit elitist, and strangely enough, she's a socialist but she's a socialist elected by elitist people. By the people who have gentrified the city. So it's a very interesting aspect of politics, I think.

Devon (00:23:13): Aesthetically, I think it seems sort of for the people, by the people, sort of thing? Just, it sounds nice and it sounds like it's a good thing, it's going to make little villages inside of Paris, so I kind of see how those two things go together even though actually, the results of such a system would be quite anti-socialist.

Alain (00:23:40): It's very inequitable, because it's the people who can afford a house of a million dollars or more who'll have free transport. And the people who live in the suburbs, the people who are baking the bread and contributing to the economy of the city, eight million people, will be outside this system and will have to drive because some who work in Paris could take public transport. But most of the other from suburb to suburb have to drive, and they will not benefit from this system. On the contrary, they will be penalized.

Alain (00:24:24): And then there are ... In a city like Paris, you have also a lot of people who absolutely need a car to go around. For instance, if you are an electrician and you are repairing the electricity of buildings and things like that, you cannot take the subway. You have to have a car, because you have your tools, you have your material there.

La Défense is the modern high-rise office-tower district of Paris, at the start of the western outskirts of the city. The core of Paris has limits on building heights (among many other constraints), so the Central Business District (CBD) ended up in La Défense where there are fewer land use constraints. This is atypical; in most cities, CBDs tend to develop at the center of the city, not on the outskirts. 
Alain (00:24:45): If you are a plumber, if you deliver ... You have all these restaurants in Paris. People have to deliver wine and beer and food to restaurants, so they have to drive, and they are penalized. That mean that instead of, let's say, if you are delivering beer to restaurants in Paris, instead of doing 10 delivery in the day, you are going to do three because there are so few roads that you can use.

Alain (00:25:15): And that means that either your salary will be much less or that whatever you deliver will be much more expensive. Probably a bit of the two. So it's not really well thought of, it's kind of a utopian ... And very elitist. It's very elitist, because again, the jobs which remain in Paris, except for the service job, again, in restaurants are corporate jobs. But many of the corporate jobs are the highest paying job. You have corporate lawyers or the headquarter of corporation in Paris, but most of the employees will be in the suburb because real estate is so expensive.

Alain (00:25:56): So again, it's extremely inequitable. But of course, the name Paris means the municipality. That means there's two and a half million people who are living in the center of Paris, so it's a ... But the gentrification in the last 50 years have been incredible. I mean, if I compare to the time when we were students, there were really working class neighborhood inside Paris municipality. And you don't see them anymore.

Alain (00:26:26): And also, many of, let's say, the grocery store, the store where just ... A common store have been replaced by high end stores like haute couture or a thing like that. So I'm not against it. I think it's a normal phenomenon. But to pretend that this is for the people is not quite true. There is an enormous gentrification.

Devon (00:26:56): Do you think that Anne Hidalgo, that the mayor, understands this dynamic and she's sort of cynically pushing it forward as a nice political move because the people in her district who voted her in support it? Or do you think she actually just doesn't really understand the dynamics and she believes that this will have a positive impact and an equitable one, but in fact, that's not the case?

Alain (00:27:18): I think she's part of what the French call the gauche caviar, the caviar left. It's people who are intellectuals, you know, they are part of the elite. They make a good living. They feel a little bad about it because the French that are always raised on the ideal of the French Revolution, of Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité. And they compensate, let's say they are in a privileged situation by pretending that they are very ... They want to share, they want to be social ... And I think it's, she probably knows inside herself that it's not quite right... But her constituency is this gauche caviar, also. It's caviar left.

Alain (00:28:01): And so in a way, it's a good way of getting reelected too. The people who have a one or two million dollars house in Paris don't care so much about the electrician who is going to fix their air conditioner or anything like that. I mean, the guy will always come anyways, so that's not one of their problem. And they are very unlikely to go and work in the suburbs.

Alain (00:28:27): But you could see the anger of people during the Gilets Jaunes, the demonstration. I don't know if you have followed that in Paris, before the COVID. There were these demonstration every weekend. People were coming from the suburbs or from the province to Paris, and they were trashing monuments, but also high end restaurants, high end shops. And that was really this anger. I mean, I don't think this was legitimate. Vandalism is never justified. But there was this anger against this enormous gentrification that benefited from enormous subsidies.

Marie-Agnes (00:29:10): I will add that also, she was elected because there is a big movement, as in many other countries, the Green have been electing Hidalgo because she promised also to have more green space in a city in Paris, and she's converting parking into parks. Not bad, but the things are, the people, the Parisian, love the idea to have a park next door. That makes apartment more valuable because you have a park next door. So the movement of Green are also pushing this idea of having transport, having less car in the city, and go by foot and go by bicycle.

Devon (00:30:02): How will that impact the people who live in the suburbs?

Alain (00:30:05): It will be worse than them, I mean when ... The contrast between the life in Paris and the life in the suburb will be much, much larger. Suddenly over there, it's so ... Because Paris is full of monument which are extremely well maintained. There is a large central government budget to maintain those monuments. For, let's say, the bridges on the Seine, some of them which were built in the 19th century, have golden decoration on it. And this gold is reapplied.


Alain (00:30:38): I mean, I'm not sure it's real gold, but say, the maintenance is extremely expensive, and it's extremely well done. But it's done with the tax payer money, so you have this little enclave in the middle of this big city of Paris, of 10 million people, for two and a half million people, where the money of the state is concentrated as a prestige thing.

Alain (00:30:59): And again, I am not saying it's bad, necessarily. But it's certainly very inequitable. So it's going to create a lot of resentment from the people living in the suburbs. We just know that about it.

Devon (00:31:12): There's also that rule ... I'm going to definitely mispronounce this, but the "fuseaux". I don't know, my Spanish accent is now coming out. But the perspective protection rule that you wrote about in your book. How does that affect these dynamics, too, and the height limits as well?

Alain (00:31:28): That's why many of the jobs have left Paris. The amount of floor space in Paris, again, when I say Paris I mean the municipality, two and a half million people, it's limit ... And by the way, it's a very fixed limit, because it has a highway around it, the Peripherique, which were where the fortification of Paris were before.

Alain (00:31:49): So you know exactly when you enter Paris and when you leave Paris for the suburb, because there is a physical barrier. These "fuseaux de protection", which protect the view from one area of Paris to some monument, the Arc de Triomphe or the Louvre or a thing like that, make Paris like a theater in a way.

Alain (00:32:10): It's very beautiful. It's a very ... But, of course, it prevents any addition of floor space within Paris. So as the economy develop, and business cannot expand within Paris because you have this absolute limit to the floor space which is there. Corporations tend to keep their headquarter in Paris for the prestige,but for only a few offices and conference room.

Alain (00:32:37): But all the workers are moved to the periphery, where then there is not such limit. And land, of course, real estate is much cheaper. So you have this dichotomy, that having the headquarter ... And now, by the way, it's all the more possible because of the Internet. Before, the employees and the bosses and the management had to be in the same building because the exchange of communication in the firm was through memos, which were typed. So the paperwork has to move back and forth within the administration, and you had to be together.

Alain (00:33:14): Now with the Internet, you could have the ruling elite of a company in a building in the center of Paris where 90% of the worker are in some lousy suburbs, at 20 kilometers from there. And it doesn't affect the management at all, because they communicate by internet and so all the information is transmitted even faster than it was when they were all in the same building. So this is convergence of things, it's quite interesting, and the effect it has on social segregation.

Devon (00:33:46): That's fascinating, yeah. I mean, it sounds like the tradeoff that the municipality has made is to preserve central Paris as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with the gold plated bridges, and the monuments with the great view throughout the whole city. But then there's this cost of pushing jobs and people outside of the city core.

Alain (00:34:04): Right, yeah, yeah.

Devon (00:34:06): That's a fundamentally political choice. How did they arrive at that decision?

Alain (00:34:09): The French are very proud of Paris, because it's only large city in France. Paris is 10 million. The next cities, Marseille and Lyon, both of them are one million. So it's a huge drop, and that's because of the centralization of the French system, centralization which came at a time of themonarchy, but was even reinforced at the Revolution.

Alain (00:34:34): And the French Revolution took place in Paris. It was really a Parisian thing, and it was imposed on the province to the point that they were provincial states, which would be the equivalent of states in the United States. For instance, Provence or Gascony, where entities traditionally which were rather large. And the Revolution destroyed all of that, and divided the country into 90 departments.

Alain (00:35:04): So imagine if the United States had Washington DC, and then everything else would be a county. You will have the federal government and the county government, without states. You will have an enormous centralization of power, by necessity, and this is exactly what happened in France. So this centralization of power, then, resulted in even a democratic government tend to spend more money in the place where they live. The deputies, they live in Paris. They may represent Marseille, but they basically live in Paris, so they will spend more money on Paris maintenance.

Alain (00:35:43): And, of course, Paris is the symbol of France much more than Marseille or Bordeaux, or something, where the United States is so much more decentralized, or even a country like Germany, for instance. It's much more decentralized by definition. Berlin is one thing, but you have Hamburg, you have Stuttgart, you have Frankfurt. You have Munich. Each city is a bit equivalent, in a way, with a very different personality. That's not the case in France, where Paris completely dominates. Everything is done in Paris.

Alain (00:36:17): So in a way, the privilege of Paris reflect a very deep cultural tradition in France against starting from the 17th century, Louis XIV, and reinforced, interestingly enough, by the Revolution.

Devon (00:36:32): One country that's very similar to France in this regard is Japan. Tokyo is one of the biggest, by far the biggest city in Japan, and it's really very quite centralized there. Do they have similar histories that caused that centralization, or did they centralize for different reasons?

Alain (00:36:49): I suppose that it's a bit similar, although it's a different story. The shogun, traditionally, were a very centralized power. And then they moved. And then when they were replaced again by the emperor, the idea that there is an emperor was, I think, reinforced the thing. And yes, it's possible that it's a bit equivalent, although a city like Osaka is still very large. Osaka is what, 25 million, I think? Yeah, something like that, 30 million people. I mean, it's not insignificant.

Alain (00:37:16): Tokyo itself is 40 million, if I remember well. But Tokyo Yokohama is close to 40 million, so it's a big city. But there is more a hierarchy of city, I think, in Japan. But it's possible, too, that the power of the central government in Japan is very high. Maybe similar to what it is in France, kind of a centralized power.

Alain (00:37:44): For instance, the Japanese have an industrial policy for distributing industry and subsidizing industry within the country, which is very similar to France, too. France has exactly the same system. So it's possible.

Alain (00:37:58): I think that even a country like Mexico, if Mexico City is 25 million people and the next city is much smaller, it's again because of centralization of power. Although Mexico is a federal republic, but still, the political power is really in Mexico City. And when sometime Mexican planners are saying, "Well, we should encourage the growth of smaller cities, Mexico is unmanageable," things like that, but this will never work unless the change the centralization of power that's inherent, again, probably the republic. Maybe it come to the history of the republic

Japan's Shinkansen bullet train system is adopting magnetic levitation (Maglev), which moves the train forward with superconducting electromagnets. We didn't cover Maglev in this episode, but it's such a cool technology that I couldn't help but squeeze these diagrams into the post. 🙂
Devon (00:38:39): I wonder how the Shinkansen in Japan impacted centralization of the country. For people listening, the Shinkansen is the high speed train system, and it's been around for about 50 years in Japan. And it links a bunch of different distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, and the whole purpose of it was to aid economic growth and development around the country.

Devon (00:39:01): But my instinct, now ... I'm curious if you two agree with this. My instinct is that by connecting all of these regions to Tokyo, it just accelerated the consolidation into the center of the country, and into Tokyo, because now everyone can be linked up to headquarters of their company, and there's less regional development. And I say that descriptively, not normatively. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. But does that make sense to you?

Alain (00:39:26): I think that in itself, the high speed train could promote decentralization. It could. But if you combine the high speed train with the demographic problem that Japan has since about 30 years now, aging population, then I think that the growth of Tokyo ... Tokyo now is practically the only city which is growing in Japan, and it's growing not ...

Alain (00:39:55): The population of Japan is shrinking slightly, so it's growing because young people are coming from smaller city. If they look for a job, they want to look for a job in Tokyo, not in a city where you have a majority of old people. And Tokyo also is much more attractive for young people because of its amenities, restaurant, thing like that.

Alain (00:40:19): As soon as a city is dominated by old people, the quality of the amenities disappears. So I think that the centralization now, the growth of Tokyo, is explained more by the demographic. And it's possible that the fast train allow young people to go to Tokyo several time to test the water, find a job, and then go back home. And then eventually, settle in Tokyo. That's possible.

Alain (00:40:53): But I think that it could go either way. For instance, when they established the TGV, which is a bit equivalent of the Shinkansen, in France, a rapid train between Paris and the province, I know that in my own town of Marseille, as soon as the TVG reach ... So we were at five hours from Paris instead of 12 hours, it increased the real estate crisis in Marseille, increasing housing prices, and the same with Nantes and Bordeaux, the other big cities.

Alain (00:41:27): So I think that the fast train could go either way. And then France could be either way. I'm not so sure that will be a big influence in reinforcing, let's say, the primacy of the capital.

Marie-Agnes (00:41:43): In Japan, when we were there, we went to a small town on the west coast of Japan, Toyama. The mayor was trying to ... There was a fast train, from Tokyo to Toyama, it took two and a half hours. And the mayor was very concerned, because all the young people were leaving Toyama and moving to live close to Tokyo, and only the old people would stay there. And the city of Toyama was doing well before the fast train, and suddenly, you have all the suburb of Toyama get deserted by the young people.

Marie-Agnes (00:42:27): And so the mayor wanted to suppress the infrastructure for the outskirt of Toyama, because it was too costing to provide services to the few houses who were still occupied. And he proposed to the old people to move to the center of Toyama in converted school, all the stadium and everything, for lodging for the old people. And giving to the old people the chance to be living in an apartment building with all the amenities, doctors, nurse, hospital close by. All the service that old people need to attract those old people back to the center, and eliminate all the infrastructure that was provided before for the larger area were doing well before.

Marie-Agnes (00:43:26): So this is, again, the fast train was a big problem for the Toyama city, and I don't know if you'll have the chance to get back the young people. The mayor was giving incentive to Microsoft people to have their office in Toyama, thinking that the young people will not have to commute anymore to Tokyo.

Marie-Agnes (00:43:50): But things didn't work ever, so there is a lot of problem with the young people want to have access to more job and change job eventually, and if you are in a small town now, it's not so easy. Maybe with the Internet, how we've ... The young people will be going back to the country. But who knows what's next?

Devon (00:44:17): Yeah, the incentives there are so interesting. A friend of mine lives in Japan and he told me about these residential taxes that Japanese cities impose on you, so I'm going to get the details wrong, but basically you're supposed to pay 10% of your tax to the town that you live in directly.

Devon (00:44:34): For many people that is Tokyo, but there was this rule that was passed a little while back called the Hometown Tax, and basically the rule said something like, "If you send 3% of the 10% back to your hometown, then you get a rebate on where you currently live." So say you grew up in Kyoto, but now you live in Tokyo. Instead of paying 10% to Tokyo, you could send 3% back to Kyoto and only pay 7% to Tokyo.

Devon (00:45:04): And some of the smaller towns started realizing that they didn't actually define what hometown meant. There was no specific definition of saying you had to be born there. It was just sort of this fuzzy term, and so they started sending gifts to people who gave the 3% back to them. And some of those gifts would end up being extraordinarily expensive, for instance, if you gave 3% back, they might spend up to 2% to buy you plane tickets to come visit your hometown, and basically you get a free vacation.

Devon (00:45:37): And there's this whole system now of gifts that towns will give you, and people will often choose particularly idyllic towns that they have basically no connection to. But they just want a free vacation, to go visit.

Alain (00:45:50): You know, when the government want to tinker with thing like that, usually it doesn't work very well. It create all sort of distortion in a funny way.

Devon (00:46:00): What have been times where governments have tinkered like that, but it actually worked out okay?

Alain (00:46:06): That's a difficult question. I'm sure it does work at times, but I cannot think of anything right now. Well, in France we have a Minister of Culture, which a big budget. It's a very prestigious position, so André Malraux, the writer, was a minister. And he established a tax, in a way, a maintenance tax on buildings. At the time, the buildings of Paris were completely black because of the pollution from cars, and so all these buildings , which are built in a very beautiful kind of yellowish stone, were in fact completely black.

Alain (00:46:48): And so Malraux established an obligation for every owner of building to clean their façade every 10 years, I think, which is quite expensive if you have a stone façade. It has to be done in a certain way. You cannot use any chemical product because it will damage the stone. But the government took also the obligation to clean, also, all the monuments, including Notre-Dame and all these monuments that are in France.

Alain (00:47:22): So there is no doubt that it created a much more attractive Paris. There was a huge difference after the law  Malraux, but it made also housing much more expensive, because you had this large expenditure of maintenance for the building. So you see, again, it's a thing which it's nice in a way, but it backfire on the people. Paris is more attractive physically, but it eliminate the poorer people from Paris. And it was a government decision, which I do not, by the way, necessarily criticize. I think that ...

Alain (00:48:04): But we should be aware when we do something like that, that we are making a tradeoff. And maybe for the image of France and Paris, or maybe for the image that the French have their own country, it's a good thing to have a very beautiful Paris with façades which are clean and nice. But it has a consequence socially, and maybe we have to compensate the people who are losing by doing something in their province or something like that. I mean, if we are aware of the consequence. The problem is beautifying an area without thinking of the impact it will have on the people.

Marie-Agnes (00:48:48): The Malraux law was not only for Paris, also the cities like Marseille. They have an obligation every 10 years to clean the façade. And it's a budget that now is part of the maintenance, and I think it has, in the cities in France, most of them, are so beautiful.

Marie-Agnes (00:49:14): And they make a lot of effort, having flowers in the main street and on the entrance. And if you visit any place in France, it's really so attractive and so much diversity from one place in France to the other, if you go to Brittany, or if you go to Provence. It has so much character. It has so much beautiful.

Marie-Agnes (00:49:42): And I think the French appreciate and like it very much, and of course, it's expensive too ... It's more expensive, but I think we love, the people love nice things.

Devon (00:49:56): It is unfortunate, though, that the building owners have to pay for it. Because it sounds like it's really an externality from the drivers, so if I were the Queen of France, I think I would try to make it like a gas tax or something to fund all of this.

Alain (00:50:10): Yes, I completely agree with you on that. But a gas tax will be paid by everybody, and especially now, a gas tax is paid more by people who have old cars than people who have new cars, because there's a huge difference in-

Marie-Agnes (00:50:27): Technology for cars.

Alain (00:50:29): ... efficiency. And so it would be an extremely unpopular tax, where here, the appearance is that, "Oh, it's owner of building who are paying." So therefore, a lot of people rent in Paris, so they feel they are not affected. And in fact, they were affected. But I agree, yes, that would be the best way to do it. Unfortunately, well, another thing which backfired, you're asking something which backfired ... No, you were asking for a positive thing.

Alain (00:51:01): So, another thing which backfired in France, they discovered, when global warming start being a concern, that a diesel car emit less carbon dioxide than the regular gasoline. So they decided to subsidize diesel, and so they subsidized diesel to the point a liter of diesel used to cost, I think, half of the price of a liter of gasoline because of the tax difference. And some other countries of Europe did the same thing.

Alain (00:51:36): So most manufacturer in Europe start making diesel cars, and then you realize that the diesel produce much more pollution than the gasoline, and you end up with terrible air quality that was not like that before in Paris and all that. So again, it's a goodwill subsidy to manipulate certain things which backfire. When you introduce a subsidy in something, you have to be very, very careful about all the side effects.

Devon (00:52:05): Oh, dear. So it sounds like they just had the science wrong. They thought diesel was better, and it turned out to actually be worse.

Alain (00:52:12): When Volkswagen cheated on the test, for them, they had invested so much in diesel, they didn't want ... They knew that diesel was polluting, in all honesty. And when the European Union put those new law about pollution, not only about carbon dioxide, but also NOx or particulates, they realized that they would have to retool entirely, to move from diesel to something else.

Alain (00:52:42): There was no such thing as clean diesel. So they decided to cheat on the test, and they developed this very clever software which could identify when the car was passing a test, and when it was on the road, so they could cheat on the test. And then they could sell their cars passing the standards. And it was only discovered in the United States by some academics who wanted to understand better all the pollution vary at different speed on the road, and they realized that the tests were fake.

Devon (00:53:18): Wow, so it sounds like Volkswagen, in a certain way, was painted into a corner where they had been encouraged by the government to do this diesel RMD, and develop cars that way, because it was subsidized, which is really the government sort of blessing that entire direction. And then later on, the government turned around and was like, "Okay, and we're going to add these other tests which actually make all of that investment that you've made moot."

Alain (00:53:43): That's right, yeah. And by the way, first, it was Volkswagen who get caught. But then they discovered that other manufacturer, like Renault for instance, did exactly the same thing. But they were not caught at the same time. But, because again, it was a big ... I mean, I'm not so sure it was survival, but it was certainly to their advantage. I mean, it would have caused a big financial upheaval if they had to suddenly convert all their car from diesel to regular gasoline.

Marie-Agnes (00:54:14): Yeah, and now the French government is subsidizing the electric cars, even the bicycle. If you have an old bicycle now, if you want to go back to your bicycle and you need some little repair before you use your old bicycle, you have a 50 Euro bonus if you go to a repair shop and the repair shop will charge you the price for repairing your bike, but you will have, from the government, the 50 Euros so your price for repairing will be less than it will have been normally. So there is all sort of things like this that the French love to get from the government. The French have a feeling that these things are normal, everything has to be provided by government.

Devon (00:55:13): That's really interesting. What impacts has the subsidy for electric vehicles had on Paris and other French cities?

Alain (00:55:21): For the moment, they are just starting, so we don't know yet.

Marie-Agnes (00:55:24): Less pollution.

Alain (00:55:25): But my problem with it is that as soon as you define a subsidy, you define also sometime a technology, so in a way, you select a technology which is not necessarily the best when you start a new thing. For instance, you know the French were probably the first to develop a quasi-Internet, run by government, what? In the '70s? The Minitel. It was free. It was a government service, and it allows you from a terminal in your branch on the telephone, in your house, for instance, to buy a train ticket or plane ticket or a thing like that. To check the hours when films were playing in a cinema.

The Minitel was a online service accessible through telephone lines, and it was the world's most successful online service prior to the World Wide Web.
Alain (00:56:12): So it was a bit like the Internet, except you could not send messages to other people. You could send message only to the administration and thing like that. You could probably pay your taxes that way. But it was free. It was entirely subsidized by the government, so the more successful it was, the more expensive it became for the tax payer. So eventually you don't make any more progress. You try to restrict the number of user, because it costs so much. So it's opposite of a free enterprise, when they are successful. Then they can expend their service and be cheaper.


Alain (00:56:47): Here, if it's free, then it becomes more expensive so you tend to restrict it. So eventually it disappeared, and it was replaced by the Internet. But I think French there get to the Internet later, because they had this Minitel in between which was, in a way, very convenient, but prevented them to shift to the Internet. I remember debates with my mother about it. She was a big fan of the Minitel and she didn't want to hear about computers, because she thought the Minitel was doing very well.

Devon (00:57:19): There is definitely a certain arrogance to subsidizing a particular technology, because you're really saying, "We know enough. We're going to pick this winner and ignore all of the others." And the Minitel, it sounds like, was actually quite useful, but with the diesel, clearly, they picked the wrong one.

Alain (00:57:37): Right, yeah. Well, you could ... We are talking about transport, so we could talk about the Concorde, too. The Concorde was a government enterprise between the British and the French to subsidize transport, supersonic transport, which was also a beautiful plane. I mean, it was well done. But commercially, completely unviable, because the technology became effective, it manufactured the plane just at the time of the oil shock. So gasoline was costing much more, and the Concorde, to fly between Paris and London and to New York, in terms of gasoline I think it consumed something like five time more than the normal flight.

Alain (00:58:23): And the plane was much smaller. If you were a passenger, it was an enormous bill. So they had to subsidize every passenger's ... The price on the Concorde was equivalent of a first class ticket plus 25%. There was no other class. But even this first class ticket was subsidized, so they gave ... By the way, at the time, of course Air France and British Airway could not even fill their plane with passengers at this price, so they gave a discount to the World Bank so that we could use the Concorde. So it was very nice for us, of course, and when I discovered that my champagne on the Concorde was subsidized by the French tax payer, I shifted to British Airways. I thought, "Well, at least let the Brits will pay for my champagne."


Alain (00:59:14): But you know, you have this absurd situation where you have a government subsidizing luxury transport. But justifying, because of the prestige of having a ... And they selected a technology at the wrong time. There is another example like that, by the way. It was the slaughterhouse of Paris. Up to the '50s, '60s, traditionally, the cattle were brought from the province to Paris and there were a number of slaughterhouses in the northeast of Paris, where the cattle were slaughtered. A bit like the big slaughterhouse of Chicago in the old days.

Alain (01:00:00): And then, the meat was distributed in Paris, but also then sent to the province by train, by refrigerated train. So the government decided to have another slaughterhouse, which would consolidate all the smaller slaughterhouses there in one area, and it was supposed to be all automatic. They introduced electronic in it. A lot of people worked on it. It was apparently a superb system, when they just finished it. It took many years and billions of dollars to finish it.

Alain (01:00:34): Suddenly the technology have changed, because refrigerated trucks became much cheaper than they were before. And so there were a lot of very small slaughterhouses where the cattle were, in Normandy or wherever the cattle were. And then the meat was sent already slaughtered, cut. Was sent to either Paris or wherever they were going by refrigerated truck.

Alain (01:00:59): And there was no need any more to bring millions of cattle every year to Paris to be slaughtered, and it was ... So this enormous building was finished, with all the electronic in it, and the government didn't know what to do with it because nobody wanted to operate it. And so they decide to ... The only way ... The building stood empty for a long time.

Alain (01:01:25): And then there were squatter in it, and the squatters were rock bands. You know, rock bands in Paris have the problem that it makes a lot of noise, and Paris is dense. So it's difficult to play rock, to especially rehearse rock music, without the neighbors complaining. So they found that moving into this enormous empty structure, they could rehearse, the rock bands.

Alain (01:01:49): And then it became a center of rock music. Eventually, the state converted it into a music center. So it's a very, very funny story. That's all, again, selecting a technology long in advance by the state, without really looking at alternatives ... Where money is no object, like the Concorde, can lead to some absurd things.

Alain (01:02:13): Now, the outcome, maybe, is not so bad. I don't know if a slaughterhouse transformed into a rock rehearsal room is a good thing, I don't know.

Devon (01:02:24): What was the name of the slaughterhouse?

Alain (01:02:27): It's called La Villette. No, it's opposite side of Rungis, yeah. No, Rungis was a success, actually. The wholesale food market of Rungis was a success. You know, the other operation was to move Les Halles of Paris. Les Halles, which was described by Zola, where you have this central food wholesale market in the middle of Paris next to the Pompidou Center.

Alain (01:02:50): And they moved it to the southern part of Paris, next to the old airport. And that was very successful, so I have to give credit here for that. That was extremely successful.

Devon (01:03:02): It's interesting to think about which sorts of projects are appropriate for the government to take on and which ones are not. I know you've spoken in the past about how important it is for some sort of central system, most likely a government, to lay out the grid and certain types of infrastructure can be built on top.

Devon (01:03:21): But then of course, it sounds like the Concorde maybe wasn't the appropriate thing for them to be working on. What do you see as the dividing line between the types of projects that a government, and really, almost only a government can do, and the sorts of things that should be left to the market and left to human ingenuity?

Alain (01:03:39): Infrastructure, I think, is certainly the main structure in our network, because if you have a network of highways or trains, or ... You need to have the power of government to expropriate eminent domain. And because when you acquire of right of way for a road or a train, you are supposed to pay market price for the land. But it's not the market, because if somebody doesn't want to sell, this person is obliged to sell, because the parcel of land is on the right of way. You don't have a choice to buy another piece of land, so it's not really market.

Alain (01:04:23): So that, I think, the government has a monopoly on this possible acquisition of land. And that's why they are better at developing infrastructure. But when it comes to selecting technology, I think they are not so good. And that's what bother me with global warming, is that very often now governments are selecting technology other than giving ...

Alain (01:04:52): One good example of government action is DARPA, in a way, or some project of DARPA, where instead of selecting the technology, they define the performance. Performance is let's say, "We want a vehicle which will be self driving in the desert, 100 miles, and that's the speed that is requirred." And that's the only thing they define... And you have enough firms that compete ... And they give a price to the firms or researchers who fulfill the requirement.

Alain (01:05:19): I think that's a good investment on the part of government. But mostly, I think that government could invest not in technology, but in fundamental research, for which there is no real market. And fundamental research now, we know in science, eventually we will have consequence for very, very useful and commercialized technology.

Devon (01:05:44): That makes sense. So it sounds like the line here is infrastructure that requires something like eminent domain, or requires coordination at a level that private company really couldn't provide. Because I think I would say that internet access and something like Minitel to me seems like infrastructure, but what you're saying is something like that doesn't actually require nearly as much coordination as building a train track, because the train track has to cut through land that already exists whereas the internet system doesn't have to do that as much.

Alain (01:06:19): Right, yeah. And if you have a server or a tower or something, you can move it wherever you want. I mean, you have some requirement, it has to be a certain location, but you don't have an absolute location. Where sometimes, for instance, if you have a water plant or a sewer treatment plant, there is usually an optimum location for it, for environmental reasons. So then you have to use eminent domain for it. But those, of course, could be after that could be operated by the private sector. But the initiative has probably to come from the government.

Devon (01:07:02): I know the Japanese train system is almost entirely private, or entirely private. And I always wonder, since they sort of operate like the government, and I'm sure that the Japanese government does have a lot of communication with them about how things work, I've never totally understood how those public/private partnership type things work. Can you speak a little bit to that, and how decisions are made by private companies?

Alain (01:07:27): The water company in France has always been private since ever, for some reason. So the government of course regulates them, because it's a utility and they have a natural monopoly. But they operate it privately and competitively. The same with the highways. There is a network of highways in France which was entirely developed privately, although the rights of way were acquired by the government and let's say, linking which city to which other city was decided by government ...

Alain (01:08:01): But as soon as the design was done, it was entirely built and operated, and is still now operated, privately. So they are all toll roads, by the way. All the highways in France have toll roads, and they are private toll roads. And one problem has been in developing country, where the government is usually rather ineffective. They are very weak, technically. The people who have a lot of technical skill very often go in the private sector, not in the government.

Alain (01:08:38): So there have been a tendency at the beginning with the financing by the WorldBbank to say, "Well, why don't we ask the private sector to operate like France's water supply, or develop a water supply system?" And it has not been very good, because if the government is not good at supervising this, this public/private partnership, then it's a complete disaster because you have a private monopoly,  and it doesn't work very well.

Alain (01:09:12): So in a way, it's only country where the government is pretty competent that you can increase the efficiency by introducing the private sector. If you introduce the private sector in a monopoly situation like the water supply, for instance, but with a very weak government, you will end up with a pretty bad result.

Devon (01:09:36): Although I suppose if you keep the water supply under the care of the government, when the government is weak and perhaps corrupt as well, that's also probably not a good outcome. So maybe ...

Alain (01:09:47): The only good outcome is to, of course, reform the government. And then you can maybe consider having a more efficient system by having ... But let's if the reason for privatizing is because the government is weak, it's too early to do it. The outcome is not good. So the outcome is not good either way, if as you say, the government operate it then it's not competent. It's not very good.

Devon (01:10:15): What are the specific steps that you've seen weak governments take to reform themselves to solve this problem?

Alain (01:10:21): I think it comes slowly, through democracy and information. I don't think there are steps, magic steps that you can do for ... The press has a role to play. For instance, I have seen in India where there is really a free press, and very kind of dynamic. The press have pretty good journalists who are really digging into a problem like water supply or transport, or even building regulations. And they do a pretty good job, and eventually, they have enough middle class who read the newspaper and read those technical article so that it create a constituency for reform and better services. So I think that this is ...

Alain (01:11:02): But it's a long thing. It's not something you do in three years or four years. And it has, in a way, very little to do with the amount of money you put in it. The World Bank has tried many time to reform governments, to give incentive either by paying them more, by training, by all sort of thing, to have better government in country which had weak government. And it has to come from the people.

Devon (01:11:31): It sounds like a recurring theme here, is that you can make a lot of infrastructure changes and they might make a difference. But if the people don't really care for it, or if the cultural norms say that something is low status, then they're not going to use it.

Devon (01:11:46): You mentioned in some middle income countries, owning a car is a big status symbol. Maybe you could make the buses as nice as you want, but those people are probably going to keep driving their car because it sort of heightens them and makes them feel good about themselves, and separates them from other people. So you have to change the culture before you can really change the infrastructure.

Alain (01:12:07): Absolutely, yes. I completely agree with that, yes.

Devon (01:12:10): We're coming up on our time now, and I have so many more questions, so I think we're going to have to save the second half of this for a part two on the transportation topic. But this was so much fun, as always, and is there anything else that you two want to add before we sign off?

Alain (01:12:26): No, thank you. I cannot think of, but I'm looking forward to the next set of questions.

Marie-Agnes (01:12:31): Thank you, Devon.

Devon (01:12:33): Thank you.

Alain (01:12:33): Thank you.#cars

                  Part 5: Relationship with Travis Air Force Base
                  

March 1st, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.

Up until recently, the new city’s potential impact on Travis Air Force Base had been a source of questions about the project. California Forever’s holdings extend to land that borders Travis, and although the city itself will be on the opposite side of this assemblage, officials raised concerns about whether building a city in the area would interfere with the base’s operations. 

To address these concerns, California Forever updated its plan to give the base more room for flight operations. These changes satisfied the base, and on February 15, Travis Air Force Base came out in support of the proposal.

I think it’s instructive to understand the background of this episode, because to make this plan a reality, over time California Forever will need to develop many more productive relationships like the one they’ve cultivated with Travis.

According to California Forever’s website, they had made the original plans in a way that "fully complied with the Air Installation Compatible Use Study published by Travis, and the Land Use Compatibility Plan published by Solano County". In a post titled Our partnership with Travis Air Force Base, California Forever walks through the considerations they took into account to protect and support Travis AFB. Here are some highlights pulled directly from that post:"The New Community is located entirely outside of Accident Potential Zones.""The New Community is located entirely outside of 50 dB CNEL noise contours.""The Initiative nearly doubles the security buffer around Travis AFB where no residential or commercial community development is permitted." (And that's even before the changes announced on February 14.)"There are fewer flights going over the New Community than over the cities of Suisun City, Fairfield, and Vacaville.""The New Community is located entirely outside of Accident Potential Zones.""The New Community is located entirely outside of 50 dB CNEL noise contours.""The Initiative nearly doubles the security buffer around Travis AFB where no residential or commercial community development is permitted." (And that's even before the changes announced on February 14.)"There are fewer flights going over the New Community than over the cities of Suisun City, Fairfield, and Vacaville."But after the details were unveiled in January, Travis still had some remaining legitimate concerns. As a result, California Forever updated the plan to remove those remaining impacts.

The adjustments included changing the zoning to create a buffer between the base and residential zones, which included relocating industrial uses to the area closer to the base in order to separate the residential areas from the base. They also zoned the westernmost portion of the new city to only permit solar farms, battery storage, and other infrastructure such as wastewater and water treatment plants. As a further protection for Travis, the new initiative also requires Travis to accept the siting, technology, and design of these facilities.

It appears that after Travis AFB reviewed these changes, they determined that the revised proposal addressed all of their concerns, and on February 15, Travis Air Force Base came out in support of California Forever’s proposal. Their press release said "Travis AFB will be able to continue flying its full mission, including all of our operational, exercise, and local training flights consisting of multiple patterns and landings to all runways", and added that California Forever’s plan has the potential "to improve the wellbeing of our Airmen and families into the future"Here is the old map from California Forever's original proposal published in JanuaryHere is the new map reflecting the February 14 changes, which addressed Travis' concernsI’m very encouraged by the constructive relationship that Travis AFB and California Forever appear to have cultivated with each other. It’s a great example of how win-win solutions can happen if both sides get creative about what’s possible. I hope California Forever is able to develop similar productive relationships with other stakeholders as it moves forward.

                  Part 6: Is the proposed new city in California climate resilient?
                  

April 13th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.One of the biggest questions I had when I first learned about this proposal was whether it is resilient to climate. We were in a neverending drought during my childhood in California, and my parents constantly reminded me to turn off the tap while brushing my teeth and let the lawn turn brown to conserve water. I also had memories of driving through Solano County and seeing how flat the land was, wondering what would happen in a flood. So naturally, I was interested to understand the climate implications of the location that California Forever selected, given the state’s past and future challenges.Is there flood or sea level rise risk?On the topic of flooding, the answer ended up being surprisingly straightforward. In the ballot initiative, California Forever stated that they are not building on any ground that is below the projected 2150 sea level rise levels, based on one of the more conservative scenarios from the state guidelines.

Here’s a map of potential water elevations from the intermediate-high 2150 sea level rise estimate superimposed over the 100-year FEMA flood level relative to the proposed site, and it turns out that the site for the new city was placed out of the way of even the most pessimistic sea level rise and flood zones. In fact the site is much more elevated than already-populated places like Oakland and Berkeley! So it seems that flooding just isn’t a problem for this project, despite my initial fears.This map shows the potential inundation from a conservative 2150 sea level rise projection for 2150 combined with the FEMA 100-year flood event. According to California Forever, the small corners of the new community in the northeast that are inside the inundation zones will be either raised above the 2150 level through fill, or will remain as parks and open space.What about fire risk?The answer to this question is pretty straightforward too: the site has virtually no trees on it, so there is no risk of forest fire. The only fire risk nearby would be from grass fires, which are much easier to mitigate through good land management practices, like sheep grazing. 

Beyond that, California Forever plans to build several thousands of acres of agrivoltaics — basically solar farms with sheep grazing — in the surrounding greenbelt, which will not only help keep fires down, but also reduce associated smoke and air quality issues.

Long story short, there’s very little mapped fire risk anywhere near the site – in fact the following map had to be zoomed pretty far out before any CalFire-mapped fire risk came into the frame:
The silhouette of the proposed New Community (the small area in the middle of the map) overlaid with the Fire Hazard Severity Zones from CalFire, which is "based on fuel loading, slope, fire weather, and other relevant factors present, including areas where winds have been identified by the department as a major cause of wildfire spread."Is there enough water?When I dug into the water question, I was surprised to find that having enough water for human consumption will require work and good design, but it’s a solvable problem. I’ll dive more deeply into each of these, but long story short, California Forever has multiple routes for securing an adequate water supply:First of all, the new city will be designed to minimize per capita water usage well below that of neighboring communities.Then, their landholdings already include water rights that can supply some of the water for the new city.California has a robust market for trading water rights, and urban uses are more than capable of paying the price needed to ensure access to that water.Finally, securing adequate water supply is a legal requirement, so they won't be allowed to build without a plan for water that satisfies state regulators.Designed for resilience & efficiency from the ground upWater use varies dramatically across California’s cities. For example in September 2014, East Los Angeles averaged 48 gallons a day per person, while northern San Diego averaged more than 580 gallons a day per person — 12 times more per person!

Water efficiency is a big focus for California Forever. The way that a community is built from the ground up can make a huge difference in how much water residents use. Through a combination of ultra-efficient appliances and fixtures, small backyards, and (most importantly!) a system for recycling and reusing water, they are targeting per capita water use levels that will be among the lowest in the state. They are also looking into using drought-resistant plants in landscaping and implementing smart irrigation systems that adjust watering based on weather conditions and soil moisture levels.

In addition, California Forever will reuse the recycled water it generates from wastewater. This can offset the amount of potable water needed and be substituted for surface water currently devoted to irrigation of agriculture in the lands around the city. Their plans also include stormwater measures that would promote the recharge of the aquifer beneath the site, replenishing groundwater supply in the process.

If anything, the new city may actually reduce the state’s water usage when projecting for future growth. The current pattern of development and sprawl uses way more water than the plan that California Forever has proposed, so if the state’s growth gets redirected to this new city instead of places where most growth has currently been happening, average water usage across the state might actually go down!Water usage varies dramatically across California’s cities (data source: Pacific Institute)CF’s landholdings already have water rightsTo begin, some of the water can come directly from California Forever’s property. The project’s urban planner Gabriel Metcalf explained that almond orchards in their landholdings could provide enough water to support 85,000 people (conserving groundwater used on the orchards and instead using it to support household use)!
There is a robust market for water rightsTo zoom out, the amount of water consumed by humans is tiny in California compared to agricultural and environmental uses — only about 10% goes to urban uses, while 50% is environmental and 40% is agricultural — so in times of drought, it only takes a small amount of the non-urban uses to be redirected towards humans to make up for any shortfall in conjunction with curtailment of non-essential urban uses like landscape irrigation.

This redirection towards the most critical uses is able to happen because the state of California has created well-defined property rights that allows water to be bought and sold, creating a market that allows water to flow to where it’s most needed. There is a well-defined hierarchy of water rights to determine how a given water source is used, and what happens when its volume reduces during dry periods. To ensure that these property rights are respected, the State Water Resources Control Board has a monitoring regime to make sure that people take only the water they have rights to.

Urban uses of water can demand the highest price, since they are for critical uses like drinking water. The higher levels of economic activity and population density also means that they generate more revenue to cover water costs compared to other activities. The combination of urban uses being able to outbid almost all other uses plus California’s robust water market means that even if California Forever did need to draw from an outside source, they would be able to get the water they need. 

Long story short, the way a city (or any other use) comes up with water to supplement its local supplies is to pay for it, either by purchasing the land and associated water rights or by purchasing water through California’s system of rights that has operated for a long time.
Securing adequate water supply is a legal requirementFinally, California’s system for regulating development requires developers to secure adequate supply. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires developers to complete a Water Supply Assessment (WSA), which means that at each stage of development, the project sponsor has to prove that they have secured rights to water, as well as the methods of withdrawing, conveying, storing, and treating the water to ensure an adequate supply for the land use they are trying to permit. 

Furthermore, California Forever has explicitly added a requirement to complete a CEQA Environmental Impact Report in the language of their proposed ballot measure, further tying themselves to the mast on the requirement to guarantee an adequate supply before they are allowed to begin development.

My takeaway from all of this is that adequate water access is not a major obstacle for this proposal. The new city fits nicely into the existing framework of water rights that California established a long time ago, and if anything it may reduce per capita water usage by redirecting new development to a place that is prioritizing resiliency and efficiency from the ground up.
If you’re interested in understanding more about the new city that California Forever has proposed, here are the other posts in the series:Intro: The new city in CaliforniaPart 1: The story of California Forever so farPart 2: Clustered development will preserve California’s landscapePart 3: The first walkable city in America in a centuryPart 4: Success is tied to benefiting existing Solano residentsPart 5: Relationship with Travis Air Force BasePart 6: Is the proposed new city in California climate resilient? (this post!)
* For a long time, the glaring exception to this rule was groundwater, and many parts of California essentially "mined" groundwater in the sense that they withdrew it faster than it could replenish. But that changed in 2014 with the passage of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA, pronounced "sig-ma"). SGMA requires that each groundwater basin have a plan for managing it at a sustainable level, such that it is not withdrawn at a faster rate than it is replenished over time.
** For example in the 2012-2016 drought, the state reduced environmental water allocations to reserve supplies for farms and cities.#california

Many people have reached out asking what books have been most impactful in shaping my views on cities. I've written and rewritten answers enough times that I figured it's most efficient if I just write it up one time here and share the link. 🙂

Order Without Design by Alain Bertaud

Reason to read this: Offers rigorous yet humble models for how urban systems work. This kind of analytical rigor is incredibly rare in urbanism!

This was one of the best books I read in 2018. My main takeaway: urban planning is still like medieval medicine, with doctors trying to leech out bad humours rather than working off of causal models with predictive power.

I've long been an admirer of Alain's work. I used to be frustrated by how imprecise many urbanists are in their analysis. Then a few years ago, I found a few of Alain's papers. They opened my eyes to the rigor that was possible when talking about cities while maintaining humility that they are complex systems that cannot be fully understood let alone controlled/designed by a few bureaucrats.

Coming from a computer science background, it was satisfying to see the intuitions I'd formed from wandering cities on foot formalized in such an elegant, rigorous way. Instead of using fluffy words like "sustainable" or "livable", you actually had predictive models! His work was so refreshing.

Needless to say, I was thrilled when a friend told me that this book was coming out last year. I purchased it immediately and was not disappointed. I consumed it over the course of a week or so, to the dismay of my partner's family with whom I was ostensibly spending the holidays.

Order Without Design was so rich and full of insight that I'm currently going back and transcribing all of the notes I took in the margins. The book formalized several things I already understood on an intuitive level, and more importantly it challenged several core beliefs I've held for a while about ideal transport modes.

The History of Future Cities by Daniel Brook

Reason to read this: Gain a sense of romance of the history behind 4 global cities. Ideal if you're about to travel to one of them. (Note: by "romance" I probably mean something very different from what most people mean...)

The book explores four cities—Bombay, St Petersburg, Shanghai, and Dubai—that were created with the idea of being a window to the future in an undeveloped, unglobalized country. Each one catapults itself into a different kind of future, but the common theme is a fascinating lense through which to look. This book helped me fall in love with cities (though I have yet to visit any of the four in the book actually!).

~

Progress & Poverty by Henry George

Reason to read this: Challenge the standard poles of political economy that you've likely heard for your entire life, a.k.a. capitalism vs socialism or communism. "Georgism" offers a third, entirely different way to see economics, which helped me break out of rigid patterns of thought.

This book transformed the way I think about land use, monopolies, and value creation incentives. Most people who talk about Henry George focus way too much on his Single Tax proposal rather than the underlying models he puts forward. There are many ways to achieve the goals he describes.

I recommend the modernized, abridged version. The original prose is way too flowery, though if you're into sermons you might like it.

If you want an even more concise (but much weirder) take on George's ideas, I recommend Becoming the Trashcan of Ideology written by a friend of mine who I think wants to stay anonymous. Must warn you that it may not make sense unless you're already familiar with Henry George's ideas...

Season of the Witch by David Talbot

Reason to read this: You are coming to San Francisco for the first time and want to get a sense of the city's recent history. This book is full of incredible stories of what happened in those mid decades of the 20th century, so you'll likely enjoy it even if SF is not on your upcoming itinerary.

Season of the Witch is a tapestry of San Francisco through the 60s and 70s. Growing up in the South Bay ~45 minutes away from the city, I had learned about the hippies on Haight Street and the gay-friendly culture of the Castro, but this book opened my eyes to a whole new level of richness in the city's history. I learned gems like the fact that Jim Jones and The People's Temple (of the infamous 1978 Jonestown koolaid massacre) played an instrumental role in George Moscone's mayoral victory in 1975. As a result, Moscone appointed Jones as the chairman of the SF Housing Authority Commission, and Jones gained access to California politicians like Governor Jerry Brown, SF Supervisors Dianne Feinstein and Harvey Milk, and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. In exchange for his cult's political support, these figures supported him and The People's Temple up until the day the news came in of the mass suicide at Jonestown. This shocking episode is just one of the incredible stories I learned about San Francisco's history from SOTW, and it completely reshaped the way I think about the city. From Jonestown and the Zebra Murders to Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, I can sum up what I learned in a brief sentence: SF during the span of the 60s and 70s was the real Gotham City.

The Power Broker by Robert Caro

Reason to read this: Understand one man's impressive wielding of power from a position that was not intended to have it. Also learn about how NYC became the city it is today. Next time you're in NYC you won't be able to walk more than a few blocks before catching Moses' name on some plaque or carved into a building.

It is the biography of Robert Moses, who was the NYC Parks Commissioner from the 1920s through the 1960s. Moses is more responsible for reshaping the entire face of New York City than any other individual, and his thinking influenced urban planners nationwide and beyond throughout the 20th century. Over the course of his career, Moses personally conceived and completed projects costing 27 billion dollars, more than any other US government employee ever. These projects ranged from highways and bridges to housing complexes and city parks, many of which required bulldozing entire neighborhoods and in turn displacing hundreds of thousands of NYC residents. Despite the immense impact he's had on the field of urban planning, Moses was never elected to public office.

The book is not only a look into Moses' fascinating life but also a unique perspective on American history and urban planning during that half century. It's also a must-read for anyone interested in how power works, even if they aren't specifically drawn in by the cities angle.

Aside from the intensity of the story itself, the research that went into this masterpiece is just awe-inspring. The author Robert Caro is the best researcher-writer whose work I have ever read. His exhaustive series on LBJ is also fantastic. Although the LBJ books are more well-known and even more ridiculously in-depth than The Power Broker, I enjoyed the story about Moses a bit more because his impact was more concrete and on a more understandable scale. Also, The Power Broker is a story about taking a seemingly insignificant position and wielding it in a way that massively amplifies its power, whereas LBJ's story is more about climbing the ladder until you're at the top. As a side note, the narrator for the Audible recording is fantastic.

Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier by Ed Glaeser

Reason to read this: A core part of the urbanism canon. People refer to this book all the time, even if they don't realize it, so it's worth having this as a base when coming into a conversation. (Jane Jacobs' Death and Life also falls into this category, though it's less propagandistic than Triumph.)

This book is about how "cities magnify humanity’s strengths". It's city propaganda at its finest, and I say that lovingly... I clearly fell hard for it! It's hard to not fall in love with cities after reading this.

Triumph is what started me down the path of thinking about agglomeration economies, which has since been a key model for how I think about cities.

~

Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States by K. T. Jackson

Reason to read this: To learn how and why the form of development has changed over the course of US history.

Crabgrass is a history of suburbanization and the history of federal policy since World War II. It filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge about how US development happened, answering many questions about the path dependence that got us to some of the weird, contradictory positions we find ourselves in today as far as urban policy goes.

"A sweeping history of suburban sprawl that showed how interstate highway construction, mortgage subsidies, and tax breaks conspired to de-urbanize the country, making the United States unlike anywhere else in the world." — Daniela Blei in A Tale of Two Cities

~

Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time by Jeff Speck

Reason to read this: To examine a specific characteristic of cities and gain concrete ideas for how to improve them on that dimension.

The core argument is that a walkable city is not just a nice, idealistic notion. Rather, it is a simple, practical-minded solution to a host of complex problems that we face as a society, problems that daily undermine our nation’s economic competitiveness, public welfare, and environmental sustainability.

                  Singapore and the international community
                  

April 20th, 2018
A while back Daniel Frank emailed me about the essay I published about Singapore, and he was skeptical of the idea that the international community would act as a deterrent against authoritarianism in Singapore:First, I don’t think this applies to most countries  (for example, look at the muted Western protest to changes in countries like Turkey and Poland).

Secondly, I specifically think doesn’t apply to Singapore. The two most influential nations/blocs on Singapore are China and ASEAN. China speaks for itself, and ASEAN adheres to a principle (the ASEAN way) of non-interference in domestic politics of its member countries.
This is a good point. Pressure from the international community is not a silver bullet, it's simply one piece that makes me more optimistic about Singapore not going horribly far on the side of human rights abuses.There are a lot of layers to this question, places where the international community acting as a deterrent could break down:
Information about abuses could not be disseminated enough for them to realize what’s going on.It could be unclear whether they really are abuses, creating a layer of uncertainty that decreases willingness to act. Also, the international community may just not care.Many of these things require cooperation among multiple groups. A single actor may not be confident enough that the others will act, rendering their own actions irrelevant but still costly. And the actors may just plain have opposing interests.The community may think—perhaps correctly—that they can’t make a difference. If a country benefits on certain industries and types of relationships, this may be more or less true.
To view each of of the layers I mention above though the lens of Singapore:
Singapore’s press is fairly controlled by the government, which is concerning. However, the city state is also open to the internet, and (to take just one niche) blogging has risen in prominence. It seems unlikely that clear abuses would be suppressed for long. On the other hand, Singapore knows how to play its numbers well. As I mentioned in the original post, migrant workers are excluded from a lot of metrics. I can only assume they’re excluded from other important narratives too. This raises the risk that their stories are ignored, that onlookers think they have the whole picture but actually they’re missing a critical chunk of the story. People are aware of this omission, but without knowing the extent it’s hard to know how much to weight it or to dig in. It also generally provides a layer of plausible deniability to the government and society which allows abuses to persist, even though every does kind of know what’s happening. This is the one I think is most problematic, i.e. the thing that most likely that the international community be defanged with regards to abuses in Singapore. Raises the question of how could we gain greater visibility into these issues? What structurally could we do to draw out information about these obscured narratives?As one example of what I mean by #2: Singapore has a free market economy (mostly). This unbridled competition can be brutal, but also "fair" under certain value systems. If we see bad outcomes, there may be less confidence/agreement that they are wrong, since they are not coercive, at least in the libertarian sense of the term. Note that I’m not arguing a free market can’t result in human rights violations, though neither am I arguing that it does—I’m simply pointing out that it clouds the conversation, which makes it less likely that people act effectively to change it.Because Singapore is so small, I suspect a single actor could unilaterally have real influence on the country. This is especially true at the scale of a single other country, even if it’s on the smaller side, since Singapore is basically just a city, but it could also be true for a large multinational company. Multilateral action is probably relatively aligned too if people did need to make a coalition—Singapore specializes in trade and finance, which are both "rising tide lifts all boats" kinds of industries, so while on any specific issue they may be at odds with other countries/companies, on net all actors way sort of the same things. This seems like it could be more challenging for export-oriented nations that focus on a particular good. (Would be curious to dive into research on this though! Pure speculation)Again, Singapore is small, and it generally wants to present itself as a stable, forward-looking country. They’re wiling to do odd things like ban chewing gum, which looks odd to the international community, but I don’t think they’d be willing to go so far as to truly abuse their citizens. I don’t think the leaders want to, and more relevantly it wouldn’t fit with the brand they’ve worked so hard to build up. Many dictators and other nations seem to care less about this reputational component, so do think this is a valid question to raise, but Singapore doesn’t fall into that bucket. It definitely cares about reputation.
We can think of this as a series of leaky buckets, with the output of one going into another. All four conditions must hold for the international community to act effectively:
They have to know what’s going on.They have to be confident that what’s going on is actually wrong.They (may) have to coordinate in order actually affect change, and while each individual actor may lament the abuses they may not be able to muster sufficient cooperation.They have to be able to be sufficiently convincing/powerful to make the difference, which can’t be taken for granted even if all cooperation and resources are mustered.
Each step of this funnel loses a bit of potency. In Singapore’s case, I think the first and second steps are the most important, but other countries likely have different levels of leakiness in the funnel. For instance in China, the Great Firewall probably means #1 is relatively more important. In Brunei, a tiny sultanate with immense oil and gas reserves, #4 may be more relevant (though I say this with very low confidence, as I'm just starting to learn about Brunei). For the US, which has a massive and diverse economy, #3 may be the core challenge.

Daniel also pointed out that while blogging is popular in Singapore, the internet is still closely monitored. He wrote, "For every Amos Lee, there are likely many more Singaporeans who have been 'chilled' from sharing their thoughts." There's also a lot of social pressure that comes from other citizens. A point I especially appreciated and hadn't considered in enough depth before was that shame plays a huge role in Singaporean society. He pointed to STOMP, a site owned by The Straits Times (Singapore's top newspaper) where Singaporeans upload photos and videos of each other indulging in "bad behavior". He wrote, "I think the prominence that shame plays in Singaporean society will both prevent many people from going forward with complaints, and also prevent the public rallying behind those who are deemed to be less than reputable, or enemies of the state." In such an environment, monitored by both the government and your neighbors, it's easy to imagine how Singaporeans might hesitate to voice criticisms of how things are run.

I really do worry about the chilling effect, and I hadn't connected the social/civil elements (e.g. STOMP) that could reinforce the government checks on political speech. No question that there are some people who would speak up if they didn't fear retribution. There's likely a more subtle effect too, where certain people don't even think to speak up because that's just not what's done. They aren't afraid per se, it simply doesn't cross their mind that it is an appropriate response. 

So perhaps step 1 of the funnel is a bigger issue than I'd considered fully before. My Singaporean friends don't seen to be stifled by these social and legal checks—they're as (if not more) vibrant and vocal as my friends here in California!—but there's probably some selection bias going on there too...

Do you have a step to add to this funnel? I suspect it’s not a complete model.

A note: Daniel mentioned several times in the email exchange that he's a big admirer of Singapore, just that this is one dynamic worth diving into further.#travel

 Bike share face-off: JUMP vs GoBike

                  Bike share face-off: JUMP vs GoBike
                  

February 19th, 2018
A few weeks ago, JUMP Bikes launched a pilot of 250 bikes in SF. Their fleet is dockless and electric, and I’ve been skeptical of the hype around both features, so I was excited to give it a spin.

My experience with GoBike, which by comparison both has stations and is human-powered (for now), has been fantastic. I’ve used it nearly every day (sometimes multiple times a day!) since signing up last spring. I evangelize it to anyone who will listen. It’s such a good product that I was a bit credulous that dockless, electric bikes could be as much of an improvement as everyone seemed to think. Much of this frenzy came from people who don’t spend as much time considering their transit alternatives, so I’d written it off a techno utopian aesthetic preference rather than a real improvement to the transit system.
I was excited to try it though, partially in the spirit of curiosity and partially after aggressive urging from certain individuals (ahem, you know who you are). Since I started using JUMP, my views on dockless and electric systems have updated. Here are my key takeaways on how they compare to the traditional GoBike fleets:

The electric motor makes the city much smaller. GoBike had made accessible lots of places I wouldn’t have usually gone, and JUMP expanded this even further. It is great for hills and long distances. There were a few particular destinations that required going up hills which I rarely visited simply because I didn’t want to show up totally out of breath. Now with JUMP, I can go to Nob Hill or up the Haight without breaking a sweat or calling an Uber. I imagine this effect is even stronger for other people who don’t already like cycling. I don't sweat much at all, but from talking to friends, a big impediment to them biking more is they don't want to show up sweaty. This city shrinking factor is the biggest advantage to JUMP in my opinion!

Dockless leads to high variance in travel times. From conversations with friends, most people seem to have the intuition that dockless is strictly better. This never seemed quite right to me—sure, you can leave the bike anywhere, but you also have to find one at the beginning of the trip, and that’s nondeterministic. This bore out in my experience with JUMP. There have been several times where I lucked out and had a bike right outside my door, but there was another time where I had to walk 20 minutes to find a bike. I was starting from Dolores Street no less, a central location where a half hour before there had been a swarm of bikes nearby according to the app.

With GoBike by contrast, you can plan your trips in advance. You’ll have to walk to and from the start and end stations, but you know exactly how to budget for that. Also, the GoBike stations are all over the place, so the walks are almost always just a block or two. When I show the GoBike map to people who haven’t opened the app before, they’re usually surprised at the docks’ density. After showing one friend recently, he continued to point out every dock we passed while walking down Valencia, reveling in his shock at just how many there were. 

In short, dockless has higher variance. Sometimes you’ll get lucky and have the bike right where you need it, but sometimes you’ll have to walk a lot farther than you expected. It’s much easier to make plans around a fleet based on the station model. On net I see this as a win for stations. 

JUMP has a better chance of competing with the car. Because JUMP is dockless and electric, it’s a real contender to Uber, Lyft, and personal car ownership in a way traditional bike share isn’t. It has the flexibility and comfort of automobiles, but it’s lighter weight and you don’t have to a parking spot, the eternal struggle of an urban driver. A Slate article from a few days ago dove deep into what it was like to ride an e-bike in notoriously auto-oriented Los Angeles, arguing that it was a great substitute. From my own experience in SF, I’m convinced that it’ll bite into the car market for a segment of young, adventurous metro dwellers. And it has the capacity to spread beyond that if they market the product right, I think. I’m excited to see where this goes.

E-bikes obviously are not perfect substitutes for cars. They are more limited by speed, though for short distances they can beat cars by allowing navigation in smaller spaces and having certain right-of-way privileges. Their capacity is also much lower. A small grocery trip is fine, but you’re probably not going to trek a surfboard on the back of your bike. You also can’t fit a bunch of kids in the back, so mini vans are probably here to stay.

In my perfect world, cities would be shaped around the pedestrian and human-powered bicycle—in other words, they’d be human scale, with small blocks, narrow streets, and mixed-use, fine-grained buildings—but we’ll have to do with the world we’ve got. American cities have been built around the car. Distances are long, and metropolitan regions sprawl out with a loose array of destinations that aren’t amenable to fixed-route transit. Walking takes too long, and our mass transit has been neglected for generations. Human-powered bikes are almost a contender, but they don’t get you quite far enough, and again the sweat factor plays a big role. E-bikes could be a huge step in shifting behavior from cars to bikes. They may also make further sprawl more affordable, which isn’t so great, but you could also make a compelling argument in the opposite direction that they’ll encourage shorter, more frequent trips. I’d be interested to see research and predictions on this question to see how it nets out in terms of effect on urbanism.

Looks like I picked a bad example… you can bring a surfboard on a bike! But I suspect most people probably aren’t going to make that happen. You don’t get as much exercise with an electric bikes. This one is pretty self-explanatory. Something I love about GoBike is that it’s a good way to incorporate exercise into your day-to-day. With the electric bikes, you don’t get the extra 20-30 minutes of pedaling. This could also be a disadvantage for people who’d prefer to not get their heart rate up when going from place to place.

On JUMP, you’re going much faster, but it doesn’t really feel like it. The sensation of biking with an electric motor is strange. It doesn’t feel that different from biking manually, but you arrive in 1/2 to 2/3 the time you normally would, so clearly you’re going quite a bit faster. A lot of the difference is in the acceleration. When you put your foot on the petal when a stop light turns green, the motor kicks in and brings you to full speed almost immediately. It also helps that you barely change speed on hills. From an enjoyment perspective, it’s nearly the same sensation as cycling through the city. I’m fairly sure that it’s not much more dangerous, because the top speed doesn’t feel much higher than when you’re on a normal road bike—the key difference is that your lowest and median speeds are a lot higher—but I worry that it may actually be much more dangerous but mismatched in the amount of fear I have around that danger because the physical sensation doesn’t differ by much.

The membership plans are structured differently. This isn’t about dockless and electric vs not, but it’s still an interesting difference between GoBike and JUMP. With GoBike, most frequent users buy a year-long membership for $150, though you can pay $3 for each 30 minute trip. With JUMP, you pay $2 for 30 minutes, every time. I’m extraordinarily sensitive to marginal costs (probably much more than I should be), but they impact others’ behavior too. Since I have the annual GoBike membership, it’s free to jump on a bike and go wherever I want. There’s definitely an aspect of induced demand here; if it weren’t so cheap to ride GoBike all over the place, I’d probably take slightly fewer and shorter trips. It also makes it more attractive relative to alternatives like transit or Uber (or, gasp, having my own car in the city). I can certainly afford to do the same with JUMP, but that extra $2 charge each time definitely makes me think about it just a little bit more. Overall, I expect I’ll end up spending roughly the same amount on the two services at the end of the year, but the fact that you pay-as-you go with JUMP shifts behavior a bit. There’s a big difference between free and cheap!

Dockless e-bikes will expand and change the makeup of the bike share market. When I first considered GoBike vs JUMP, I thought the proper question was "Which one will beat out the other?". I’ve come to realize it's not as much about one system replacing the other but rather serving as complements. My friend Alex Forrest of Train Twitter fame always points out that it's not about one mode beating out all others (yes, even trains!). It's about creating the breadth of options that support the lifestyles we want and the lifestyles we want to encourage in ourselves and others. This always seemed right to me, but my new experience with JUMP makes me think it’s also right when applied to the more subtle differences between bicycle systems.

I'll admit that my usage of GoBike is lower than it was before signing up for JUMP. There is clearly a component of substitution, and from a revenue perspective GoBike is probably hurt from JUMP’s entry into the market right now. However in the long run it seems plausible that this will grow the size of the entire market for bikes and bike share programs and not just eat into the current market. I've preached mentioned the advantages of bike share to several friends who'd never shown much interest in GoBike before (for which I was an aggressive evangelist), but it wasn't until JUMP that I heard inbound interest from others. Many of the same people who'd roll their eyes at me when I started getting into yet another conversation about GoBike were enthusiastically describing the benefits of JUMP and insisting I give it a go.

TL;DR: I’m excited to see the effect of causing people to think critically about their transportation choices!


An interesting side note—the weekend JUMP announced its public launch, I downloaded the app… only to find myself in the waitlist! Luckily a friend let me use his account, and then a few days later I got off the waitlist, but in my quest to gain membership I learned something interesting: the reason JUMP Bikes has only 250 bikes despite overwhelming demand is because Ford GoBike has an exclusive agreement with the City of San Francisco. It allows for pilots with other operators up to 250 bikes, but no more. (Note: the specifics here are hearsay from a friend, so I may have the details wrong. This article from the SF Examiner from October 2017 goes into a bit more detail, though circumstances have clearly changed since then.) It’ll be interesting to see how that plays out. From what I’ve heard, JUMP is betting on saying that the fact their bikes are electric exempts them from the exclusivity around bicycles, but that seems a bit dicey to me.

 Libertarians who are no doubt accustomed to meeting their ideas in caricature have probably been told that in a libertarian world—one with private streets, private mass transit, private utilities of all descriptions, private ownership of redwood trees and alligators—everything would have an explicit price to it. To walk on the streets, to visit the parks, individuals would be required to make an explicit contract. That this is in fact a distortion can be seen because the real world has been kind enough to provide Walt Disney World, a contractual city which bears no resemblance to the caricature.MIRABILE DICTUIt is, I presume by now well known that Walt Disney World is full of marvels. The city has, for example, a smoothly functioning mass transit system, no pollution to speak of, a garbage disposal system which defies belief (garbage is not picked up by trucks—it is disposed of by a network of pneumatic tubes leading to an off-site processing plant), an area for alligators and ecological researchers to admire each other, and fire sprinklers in the buildings. I hope it is not necessary to mention that all this is unusual.
What is not that well known (outside of the economics profession) is why all this has come to pass. The best that a noneconomist has been able to do is to assert that this is Walt Disney's great work of art. Which is, of course, to say it is inexplicable. But even at that, the explanation is a puzzle since Disney productions of all sorts have never had a reputation of sacrificing financial interest to the whims of art critics.
The point of what follows is to work through the incentives provided by the free market which presumably led to the creation of Walt Disney World in its present form. I have no knowledge of the actual decision making—what follows, if you will, is a model which attempts to simplify reality so it can be understood.
Nothing Disney Corporation has undertaken and accomplished should be conceptually surprising. Given the incentives provided by an absence of political constraints, the result seems to be rather automatic. This is not to denigrate in any way the great technical virtuousity which was involved—it is breathtaking. My point is simply that excellence in all things is subject to the usual laws of economic theory: the higher the rewards, the more will be forthcoming.
The important difference between Walt Disney World and other cities is to be found in the ownership of the land. In the case of Walt Disney World, one profit-making entity owns everything; whereas in normal cities the ownership of the land is highly decentralized.OUT OF SIGHTConsider one of the standard problems facing a city—that of garbage disposal. There are, of course, many ways to remove it; one method which seems common in normal cities is to stuff it in cans, put the cans in the street and then wait until the garbage trucks remove it. There is a problem with this; that is, the sight and smell of garbage is something which most people would I think pay to be able to avoid. In a normal city it does not seem possible for people to buy their way out of viewing garbage. There are a large number of people disposing of their garbage this way; there are a large number of people being bothered by this method of disposal. (It is dangerous to ignore the fact that in matters of this sort, the same persons are bothering and being bothered.) Each person being bothered would have to offer the others a bribe to find an alternative method of disposal.
Now consider the same problem in Walt Disney World. If Disney Corporation owns all the city land, it is obviously going to have to find some method to dispose of the garbage. If it adopts the standard solution it bears the burden of people's displeasure at the garbage in the form of a reduction in revenue: people will pay less to shop and visit if they have to trip over garbage. Plus, if people will pay less to shop, the rent which Disney Corporation can charge will be reduced. Thus if Walt Disney World adopted a method of garbage disposal which did not bother people, they could charge more rent.
The solution which Disney found—using pneumatic tubes—is probably more expensive in terms of direct cash outlays than trucks and cans. The powerful restructuring of incentives which comes from a local monopolization of the land is precisely that decisions are not made solely on the basis of direct cash outlays. There are costs to people to have to walk through, over and around garbage cans. If these costs are reduced by a pneumatic tube method of disposal, then Disney can charge more rent. If the increase in rent is sufficient to pay for the more pleasant method of garbage disposal, then it is obviously to the interest of Disney Corporation as a profit-making entity to adopt a cleaner method. (If the political process could work as well as some people think it does, then obviously normal cities would have Disney type garbage disposal systems. If you think so, look around.)RESPONSIBILITYIn the jargon of my profession, Disney Corporation has by a local monopolization of the land, effected an internalization of external economies. In English, what has happened is that this system of private property has given one decision making entity undiluted responsibility for the affairs of a city. If something goes right, Disney Corporation will benefit. If something goes wrong, Disney Corporation will take it in the wallet.
This assignment of responsibility is spread through minute details. For example, in the calculation of the costs and benefits of fighting fires, it no doubt was realized that if a few dozen people were burned to death every year, Walt Disney World would become less pleasant to visit in proportion to the value which people attach to unfavorable changes in their life expectancy. Thus, in Walt Disney World the buildings have sprinklers.
In typical cities buildings often do not have sprinklers, since the owner of the land counts on the city fire department to fight fires for him—the legal system allows him to slough off the responsibility onto his neighbors. Disney Corporation has no one on whom to slough off the responsibility: it has to fight the fires! It is simply a matter of cost/benefit calculation with respect to which is the more efficient method of doing the job. What makes Disney unique is that its structure is such that all the hidden costs—here the value of change in life expectancy to visitors—are present when the cost/benefit calculations are made.THEORYAmusingly enough, the intellectual guide for all this was written by Prof. Paul Samuelson, who has never been noted for his enchantment with laissez-faire. Professor Samuelson constructed the first mathematical model of what an efficient city would look like, but he did not, apparently, believe that such an efficient city could be produced by either market or political forces. (This work is most conveniently located in the section on the pure theory of public expenditure in his Collected Scientific Papers. Professor Samuelson functions as a latter-day David Hume to believing libertarians.)
The idea that a contractual city would have an explicit price attached to previously state-provided or "public1" services—streets, parks, museums, whatnot—suggests that insufficient attention has been paid to the work on the theory of "public2" goods. We must be careful with words. It is disingenuous to confuse an argument with a pun. "Public1" and "public2" have much the same relation as the "state1" of New York and the "state2" of insanity.What has been argued by Prof. Samuelson is that the normal market process will not provide such things as public2 goods nearly as efficiently as it will provide bread and autos.
The purest examples of public2 goods are ideas and images: the theorems of Euclid and the poetry of Shakespeare. They are goods which, once produced, can be used by anyone without cost and without less being left for anyone else. A public2 good is one which over a range can be used without cost, in the sense that no extra resources are expended. Impure examples of public2 goods are city streets since after a point a street becomes crowded and an extra person using the street imposes costs on those others using it. The cost here would be in the form of time lost due to congestion.
An important aspect of Samuelson's argument is right if we constrain ourselves to the existing legal system, as Ronald Coase so ably pointed out in his 1960 Journal of Law & Economics article "The problem of social cost." Restating his point: if there were an incentive for (say) private toll roads to emerge in the normal legal structure, then surely somewhere in the country they would have emerged. If the market can provide heroin and gasoline—in spite of the penalties exacted—then certainly toll roads would have emerged.
Where there is a free hand to effect efficient legal systems the production of private roads should be no more surprising than any other commodity. With each legal system, one can associate a set of costs to effect the transactions to provide public2 goods. It seems clear that a Disney World legal system has lower costs of transactions than that of a normal city. It is also clear that it is a nontrivial problem to get there from where we are now.SO NOW WHAT?The problem is that it would not do very much good, if any, to sell the governmental part of the cities. Some problems cannot be solved efficiently, as David Friedman suggests in The Machinery of Freedom, by selling the state in small pieces. In such problems as have been discussed above, the whole thing, both private and state sectors, must be combined into one decision making entity.
Another possible solution is to trade the owners of land shares in a corporation which will own the city for their land. Unfortunately, there will be incentives for individuals to hold out for more than the present market value of their land.
The most likely course of action is to let normal cities continue to destroy themselves and to let WDW-type ventures profit. Already people are noticing that some city governments—New York, for example—are bribing their way out of labor disputes by promising higher pensions instead of higher current wages, which presumably will be paid for by higher taxes in the future. If the taxes in a city rise too much relative to neighboring communities, and if the tax rise is foreseen, it will be very much to the interest of people to move, sometime between now and then. This movement will in turn reduce the tax base, necessitating either higher tax rates or reduced services. Either of these will cause more people to leave. It is not at all clear that the situation possesses a stable equilibrium.NOT LIBERTARIANInterestingly enough, the resulting contractual city might not be libertarian, if by the latter we mean that everything is permitted which does not physically coerce others. This is a difficult point. One might think that if the restriction of economic activity were a matter solely between the owner of the city and the individual, the outcome would be libertarian because there are no third party interferences. However, if the owner of the city is profit maximizing then it would seem that what influences his decision is really nothing other than third party considerations. If I let Weird Sam expose himself at the bus station what will this do to the city rent? If this activity makes third parties on net willing to pay less then it may well be banned by the owner—even if the owner could not care less one way or the other. What will be allowed and what will be banned will, if the argument above is correct, depends upon how much third parties are willing to pay to live with and without any particular activity.
For example, one cannot drive a car in Walt Disney World nor can one sell pornographic literature. Obviously, these are not physically coercive acts. They are, however, acts which under certain conditions impose costs on other people. Some people are bothered by pornographic literature; that is to say, they would pay to avoid it. In Walt Disney World they have this chance. No doubt, it was long ago determined that a Walt Disney World without pornography would be a more profitable Walt Disney World than one with. (However, Walt Disney World represents a special case with respect to pornography because it is, in addition to being an exercise in economic theory, an amusement park catering to children and their parents. An "adult" version of Walt Disney World might have strikingly different rules.)
It is important, I think, that we not confuse what will occur under a legal system with few transactions costs with what we hope will occur. I, myself, would hope that pornography, prostitution, gambling, etc. would be allowed since I do not believe that these forms of economic activity impose harm on third parties. Nonetheless, they do seem to impose costs on third parties. And if the costs are large enough, an efficient contractual city might well ban them or at least tax them heavily. (If the costs depend on the visibility, these activities might be simultaneously explicitly banned and implicitly tolerated.) It is not possible to define an efficient set of rules or laws for a city without reference to the people who live in and visit the city. The handy rule—everything not physically coercive should be allowed—ignores the fact that cost and harm are states of mind. To detect a state of mind without asking or observing action is rather difficult. Anything is harmful if you would pay to get rid of it.
Of course if the United States were composed of cities run on a Walt Disney World basis, there would no doubt be terribly puritanical communities with respect to sexually explicit literature, cruelty to animals, seat belt usage—all the standard "moral" problems—but there would also be incentives for other communities to cater to individuals' "immorality." (That is, if enough individuals wished to purchase sexually explicit literature which was not allowed for sale in their own city, some nearby city would probably find it to be in its interest to sell it.)
A contractual state of affairs, then, need not be attractive only to libertarians. Religious or moral authoritarians might well pay for the privilege of living in a "clean" city, just as you or I might pay for the privilege of living without religious or moral authoritarians telling us what to do. The country is big enough for everyone to be able to work out the conditions under which they wish to live, if and perhaps only if, a contractual process can be effected.
If the argument is correct, this should be something which will pay nicely. I find comfort in comparing the price paths of New York City bonds and Disney Corporation stock.

                  IVF egg retrieval notes
                  

April 2nd, 2024
I’ve now done two egg retrieval cycles. Given that I had a zillion questions before I started, I thought I’d share my notes for others who might have similar questions.Things I would’ve loved to know beforehandOverall the process was way easier and less intense than I expected. It was mostly annoying, because I had to go to tons of doctor’s appointments and get my blood drawn multiple times a week, but in terms of symptoms and pain it was very low key.I also had a very serious hand injury and series of three surgeries shortly before starting this process, so this may have felt minor in comparison.A lot of people report IVF being very difficult and uncomfortable, and I also may have just gotten lucky. But I wanted to share my experience so people can understand the range.Shockingly, I came to look forward to the injections each night. This was shocking because before this, I had a medium phobia of needles. Mixing the medications is a relaxing process (took ~20 mins each time), and I’d always feel really proud of myself after doing the injection. To be clear, I never enjoyed doing the injection itself, and the very first time it was really scary, but I was really proud of myself for how quickly I got used to it. Neuroplasticity for the win!Symptoms during/after the retrieval:After the first 4-5 days, I had minor discomfort in abdomen if I moved or bounced, but really almost nothing.Slightly more acne for the first round, but not the second. Maybe because I had to go off Tretinoin? Or maybe because of hormones?The day of the retrieval itself, I felt groggy and sleepy and ended up napping all afternoon. The very next day after, I was up and about and felt almost totally normal, to the point where I was already gardening and lifting heavy things (which in retrospect was probably pushing myself sooner than I should have, but I think it turned out fine!).Things to know regarding medications:Prenatal vitamins – wish I’d started sooner the first time around; the longer you do them ahead of time, the better. The second round I started them sooner.Since I am young and had a particularly large number of eggs, I’m at higher risk of OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome), so they gave me meds to reduce that risk. I believe the category of drugs is called "GnRH antagonists". If you have a lot of follicles, make sure they give it to you. A friend of mine didn’t get it for her first round, and she got OHSS and her recovery was awful; when she did her second round, they gave it to her, and it was way better.The genetic reports (PGT-*) take a while to receive (as you can see in the calendar below).The funnel math is brutal from eggs → fertilized → frozen → genetic testing → implantation. Make sure you understand it well, otherwise you may be very disappointed and surprised by the results, even if you get a ton of eggs!

CalendarsOne thing I was surprised to not have more information ahead of time was the scheduled of appointments and medications I would be taking. The dosage and timing of everything are determined based on your day-to-day blood test results, but I thought there would at least be some example calendars I could look at to get a sense of the rhythm to expect. Nope! 

So for anyone who's looking for the same thing I was, below you'll find the calendars of the two retrieval cycles I've gone through (and here's a link to the Google Doc, in case that's easier to read).Round 1 calendar: June 2023Round 2 calendar: March 2024

                  Book review: Against the Grain, by James C. Scott
                  

January 1st, 2020
The book that etched the deepest grooves in my mind last year was Against the Grain by James C. Scott. It explores how the unique characteristics of grain-based agriculture shaped the early history of states.
While I did learn many interesting historical facts and trends from the book, what stood out to me most was Scott's emphasis on epistemics. When he pointed to the archaeological record, he wouldn't simply cherrypick a basket of facts that supported his arguments. Instead he explained how archaeological evidence is gathered, and where that leaves systematic holes in our knowledge. 
For example, he pointed out that what we envision when we think of archaeology is really just the archaeology of states, cities, and monuments, rather than of nomadic or indigenous peoples, because those are the sites that are lowest-hanging fruit for archaeologists to find:
"That states would have come to dominate the archaeological and historical record is no mystery... A great deal of archaeology and history throughout the world is state-sponsored and often amounts to a narcissistic exercise in self-portraiture. Compounding this institutional bias is the archaeological tradition [...] of excavation and analysis of major historical ruins. Thus if you built, monumentally, in stone and left your debris conveniently in a single place, you were likely to be "discovered" and dominate the pages of history. If, on the other hands, you built with wood, bamboo, or reeds, you were much less likely to appear in the archaeological record. And if your were hunter-gatherers or nomads, however numerous, spreading your biodegrade able trash thinly across the landscape, you were likely to vanish entirely from the archaeological record."
The entire framing of archaeology as an exercise in epistemics was new to me and immensely thought-provoking. He then pointed out that "the state has dominated only the last 0.2% of our species' political life", despite the standard archaeological lens focusing on states. This stark numerical contrast blew my mind, comparing the dominance in my own mind of monumental archaeology—the Parthenons, the Pyramids, the Machu Picchus of the world—to the shrinkingly small sliver of human history they represent.
Overall the book did a fantastic job of helping me, a complete newcomer to archaeology, build mental models about the discipline. Most books I've read about early history are just a monotone timeline of facts of events, without much theory tying them together, let alone the meta work of explaining how they got to their conclusions so that the reader can judge the historian's intellectual path for themselves. For example, Scott writes, "History records no cassava states, no sago, yam, taro, plantain, bread fruit, or sweet potato states...only grains are best suited to concentrated production, tax assessment, appropriation, cadastral surveys, storage, and rationing." I adore how he dives into the actual dynamics of the system whose history he's writing about, and explaining the "gears" of change. That's sadly rare in all writing, not just history.
I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I've historically found it difficult to care about or appreciate history that goes sufficiently far back. The greater the distance grows between modern day and the time I'm reading about, the harder tends to be for me to continue paying attention. I'm excited to say that Against the Grain shattered this correlation. And not only is it a massive outlier, but I can't stop thinking about the topics explored in the book, and it's made me eager to read more books about the deep past—so long as they help me build mental models, rather than simply offering a monotone timeline of facts and events.

October 12th, 2020
Nadia Eghbal’s new book, Working In Public: the Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software, may not have been on your short list of books to read this year. It’s admittedly a nerdy topic: it’s about open source projects, roles and responsibilities; the rise of GitHub as a developer platform; and how developer culture is evolving around the new power of creator platforms. 
I recommend you get it. It is mostly about software development, but the core insight of the book is bigger: Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we make things, and how that’s changing. 
Who does the work?
Working in Public opens by challenging a common perception about open source today: the idea that it’s collaborative. 
The widespread perception of open source is that it’s community work. Looking back at the first heyday of open source in the 90s, you picture these loosely organized, squabbling, collaborative efforts between a closely-knit group of nerds. Some special technology, notably Linux, emerged from that era as evidence that self-motivated teams of volunteers could build world-class products. 
One of the radical ideas from this period was that loosely organized, socially motivated volunteer communities could accommodate more useful contributors than formally managed teams. Traditionally, the rule in software engineering is that "adding more engineers to a project makes it ship later", popularized in Fred Brooks’ 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month. It makes sense: beyond a core team, adding marginal engineers to a task creates more costs (getting them up to speed, dealing with team complexity) than benefits (any useful output they manage to ship).  
The open source experience in the 90s violated that rule. Self-organized communities, coordinating via forums and email lists, learned how to accommodate hundreds of productive contributors. We rethought Brooks’ law: if they’re all genuinely self-motivated, then the more the better; they’ll figure out how to make it work. The corollary to this understanding became: if you need to get more work done, go attract more contributors. 
Those lessons have carried forward to today, where open source has become so widespread we’ve dropped the name: it’s just "The Ruby community", or "the Python community". Eghbal writes: "The default hypothesis today is that, faced with growing demand, an open source "maintainer" – the term used to refer to the primary developer, or developers, of a software project – needs to find more contributors. It’s commonly thought that open source software is built by communities, which means that anyone can pitch in, thus distributing the burden of work. On the surface, this appears to be the right solution, especially because it seems so attainable. If a lone maintainer feels exhausted by their volume of work, they should just bring more developers on board."
Unfortunately, for many maintainers, that collaborative mindset no longer reflects reality. 
"However, in speaking to maintainers privately, I learned that [initiatives to bring on more contributors] caused them to seize with anxiety, because such initiatives often attract low-quality contributions. This creates more work for maintainers – all contributions, after all, must be reviewed before they are accepted. Maintainers frequently lack infrastructure to bring these contributors into a "contributor economy"; in many cases, there is no community behind the project at all, only individual efforts."
Something important changed between the 90s and today. If you look at most open source projects now, the distribution of who’s doing the work versus who’s simply there is skewed dramatically: it’s common to see projects where 95% of the work is done by a nucleus of people, perhaps even a single developer, with a long tail of "contributors" who are really more like users or consumers: they might offer occasional pull requests, or flag some issues occasionally, but they’re more like fans watching a football game than the main players. 
"Fans" is a useful comparison. They serve an important purpose, they’re excited about the project, and they want to be a part of it. It’s like how fans of a band want to "be a part of something", while understanding it’s not really their show. You’re happy they’re there; the point of creating open source code is sharing it, and there’s no better sign that you’re doing something useful than fans showing up. Fans are your distribution. But fans are costly. They want to engage with you; they need interaction, and they need your time. Having more fans is great, but it doesn’t make your life easier.
Today, the natural constraint on open-source projects has become like an upside-down Tragedy of the Commons problem. The classic commons problem involves a self-renewing but finite public good, like the town green for grazing animals. Here, the commons at risk of being overdrawn isn’t the product; the code itself can be consumed limitlessly. The risk is that the creators become overdrawn and overwhelmed with participation, and with demands on their time. 
Eghbal puts it succinctly: "It is not the excessive consumption of code but the excessive participation from users vying for a maintainer’s attention that has made the work untenable for maintainers today." As the creator of code, you aren’t a community member anymore. You’re a performer, and you’re on stage. 
Communities are for collaborators; Platforms are for creators
So how did this happen? How did we go from Brooks’ Mythical Man-Month, where adding more contributors were a net cost, to the 90s source ideal where adding new contributors magically worked, and then back to this new present situation, where they’re a cost again?
Here’s where we get to the real insight of the book, which isn’t actually an insight about software. It’s an insight about the relationship between creators and platforms. 
If you go back to the 90s, when we first figured out how communities built software, it took a lot of work to use the internet. It wasn’t fast or easy, but that made it special: it meant that everyone on the internet cared about it, a lot. You were really committed to being there. Online communities back then were like a federation of villages; each one had its own culture, its own customs, and its own values. The open source community was like that too, and remained so for a long time. 
In these kinds of environments, attracting more users really did advance open source projects, because the costs were usually worth it. When a new member joined a community, they were probably serious about it. There weren’t many "tourists" back then, so there was a real environment of camaraderie. Existing users were happy to onboard you and teach you things, because their effort would likely pay off as a good investment. 
Since community members joined slowly and stuck around, there was a lot of trust and shared context in the group. Every community had a different way of working, so there was a fair amount of friction preventing users from jumping around or "surfing" from project to project. Groups could preserve and maintain their collective motivation to keep shipping; they weren’t getting paid, so that motivation was everything.
It sounds pretty idyllic, and for many users back then, it was. As the internet grew more popular, the old timers reliably complained every September as a new crop of college freshmen gained access for the first time, not knowing any of the social conventions. AOL opened the floodgates in 1993, which Usenet bitterly declared "Eternal September", and the internet veterans have been complaining about it since.  
We know what happened next with online content. The tapestry of forums and newsgroups that made up the early internet flourished for a while, but in the 2000s an invasive species arrived: the platforms. The platforms made it so easy to create, share, distribute and discover that everyone joined them, smushing everything together into common, user-friendly formats without the local context or nuance of the smaller groups.
In the open source community, GitHub changed everything. Before GitHub, open source communities didn’t only differ in their social conventions and quirks; they also differed in how they did the work; specifically, in how they managed something called version control while developing software. Once you’d identified your favourite way, you’d likely stay loyal to the projects who used it. 
GitHub changed all that. In platform fashion, GitHub started with a simple and convenient set of tools for hosting and version control, but quickly grew into a network. If open source before was like a cluster of distinct villages, GitHub was like a highway connecting them all: developers loved it, because GitHub made it easier to create and distribute and discover. It quickly became the standard way you interacted with projects, and with other developers. 
This transition was really tough for the old way. Having one standard set of tools and practices meant a continual revolving door of users, all doing exactly what they’d been told to do: "Want to get into open source? Go check out projects! Make some pull requests! Get involved, be humble, and ask to learn!" With no friction associated with joining or leaving a project, popular projects would get immediately overrun with "help", but see little real benefit; only irritation and burnout for maintainers, overwhelmed by all of the well-intentioned but short-lived visitors. Developer Nolan Lawson described his experience in the book as "a perverse effect where, the more successful you are, the more you get ‘punished’ with GitHub notifications." It’s Brooks’ law again, bizarrely reincarnated. 
On the other hand, platforms like GitHub are incredible for creators who understand how to work a crowd. Like Twitter or any other social media format, GitHub helps creators to create franchises around themselves, and become known for who they are, rather than what they’re working on at any given moment. Platforms give power to individuals, but it comes with an imperative: you cannot treat your collaborators as peers. You have to treat them as fans, and give them what they want, while protecting your ability to keep creating. 
As Eghbal notes: "Like any other creator, these developers create work that is intertwined with, and influenced by, their users, but it’s not collaborative in the way that we typically think of online communities. Rather than the users of forums or Facebook groups, GitHub’s open source developers have more in common with solo creators on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or Twitch, all of whom must find ways to manage their interactions with a broad and fast-growing audience."
We Shape our Tools, and They Shape Us
We used to think about software as a product with inherent scarcity: we sold licenses, on floppy disks and CDs, like it were a physical good. We recreated the familiar real-world scarcity we were used to, for no reason aside from that it was how we knew how to sell products. We’ve now learned that code isn’t scarce; it’s the making part that’s scarce. Code is simply a byproduct; the makers and maintainers are what’s valuable. 
Code is clearly a kind of technology. It’s a production factor; it gets things done. And yet, in the creator’s mindset, code is also unmistakably content. There’s a cost to making it, and there’s a cost to making it big; but that cost is not because marginal consumption itself is expensive. It’s because success brings attention, interaction, and maintenance – both of the code itself, and of the creator’s reputation. This all takes work, and it’s often not the kind of work the creators like doing. 
When you create great products, and people get engaged, you become a show. Shows create their own success: fans create more fans, just like product use creates more of itself. Conversely, if no one’s at your show, no one will go next time. If no one uses your product, it won’t improve. There’s no business on earth with a greater divergence of outcomes between the winners and everyone else.   
There’s an old bit of wisdom that nothing is harder to sustain than an emotion. Momentarily putting on a great show is one thing; sustaining that environment and that emotion, not just for the fans but especially for the creators, is incredibly hard to do. Show business, in a nutshell, is the art and science and orchestration that happens around the show that keeps those emotions renewed, and not exhausted. 
It feels strange to juxtapose these two kinds of vocations. Making technology seems like a world apart from entertainment and show business. But in this new world, making is show business. Look at what founders do all day! And I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. It’s hard work to create a product, create attention, and then – most importantly – manage that attention so it feeds you momentum but doesn’t burn you out. That’s the hard part of show business; the part they don’t tell you about. 
The hardest thing to do is to create, and then keep creating. The people who make the greatest impact are the people who can keep creating, one thing after another, growing in impact each time. If you look at the world’s great makers – Elon Musk, Beyoncé, whoever you like – they don’t stand apart because of their raw talent. They stand apart because they’re able to sustain their creative output for year after year. They manage to keep shipping and compounding their success while leveraging the show around them.
Platforms reward that skill set. At their extreme, it becomes the primary thing that matters.  Does that mean all making will trend this way? Not necessarily; it’s a choice. But it’s a choice we make lot. Startups begin and grow within the context of a local scene, not unlike the way bands get started and level themselves up. Many modern tech companies have an average employee tenure of around 2 years; this would be disastrous for an older company or community, but in this new creator-driven model, it’s what we’ve optimized for.
In the old world, you maximized engagement and retention of your community by giving them trust, and giving them context, and making them peers. Platforms make it easier to create and discover and distribute, but at a cost: too many people, too much attention, and too little friction to join or leave. The cost of platforms is less overall trust, and less overall context, for everyone but the core nucleus. Instead of fighting that tradeoff, we accept it: we find new ways to build, like microservices, which make it easier for low-trust, low-context participants to be productive anyway.
You can see what’s happening here: it’s We Shape our Tools, and They Shape Us (and then We Shape Our Tools Again). Our desire to create and discover leads us to build tools and platforms that make creation and discovery easier. This dramatically levels the playing field for participation, and you get way more participants, but they’ll be coming in without context, and without trust. So we adapt in order to make them useful anyway: software is getting more modular, more plug-and-play, and less monolithic. It’s not necessarily better software, but it accommodates the way we build now.
Working in Public is a great book, because it walks you through in detail how the software community implements this philosophy in practice. It’ll be everywhere, soon enough.Like this post?

You're not allowed inside the Duomo with your shoulders uncovered. We learned this the hard way. I was wearing a spaghetti strap dress (it's 92℉/33℃ and humid here in Milan), so they stopped my little group at the entrance, after we'd already purchased 3 tickets.Luckily, we only had about 15 seconds of frustration. I said "Ah that's a shame", Sebastián responded "Oh I'm sure there's a shop around here somewhere", Tyler said "Markets in everything...", and then we looked up and sure enough there was a street seller approaching with an armful of 2€ kimonos!We made it into the cathedral with barely skipping a step. Thank you, goddess of commerce.

 Google Docs' sheet-of-paper metaphor


                  Google Docs' sheet-of-paper metaphor
                  

May 12th, 2019
For ages, I've wondered why Google Docs still clings to the sheet-of-paper metaphor when lots of its users never print out most of their documents.

Of course it does make sense for "Print layout" to be an option. Many people do print docs, and students make up a huge portion of the users. What I find strange is that Google Docs imposes this UI—you cannot escape the sheet of paper with its edges and isomorphic physicality even if you're just creating what's in effect an editable webpage.

Though I've wondered this for a long time, I only just verbalized this yesterday: 
Why does @GoogleDocs still impose the sheet-of-paper metaphor? In many organizations, I wouldn't be surprised if <5% of documents were ever printed.Ironically, @Dropbox Paper is the one that finally embraced the fact that most docs today are really just dynamic webpages.— Devon ☀️ (@devonzuegel) May 12, 2019Saying it "out loud" had an interesting effect: it made me realize I already had a solution! I've used a Chrome extension called Stylus for years, a custom styles manager that allows you to add custom CSS to any page you visit. I had just not put two and two together to realize that was more than enough to get to a workable solution. So thanks world, for drawing out a solution latent in my brain.Before
After

Steps to replicate itInstall the Stylus Chrome extension: chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmneMake sure you have `Print mode` checked off: Add a few lines of custom CSS: Enjoy your clean, web-native Google documents!


The downside to this approach is that it's visible only to you. The document you're creating appears different to other people, since they don't have the extension installed and populated with your styles, which is not ideal. That said, it's easy enough to toggle off the custom styles that it's not that hard to temporarily view what it looks from other views.#writing

There is no definitive census of all the intelligent species in the universe. Not only are there perennial arguments about what qualifies as intelligence, but each moment and everywhere, civilizations rise and fall, much as the stars are born and die.
Time devours all.
Yet every species has its unique way of passing on its wisdom through the ages, its way of making thoughts visible, tangible, frozen for a moment like a bulwark against the irresistible tide of time.
Everyone makes books.
***
The Allatians
It is said by some that writing is just visible speech. But we know such views are parochial.
A musical people, the Allatians write by scratching their thin, hard proboscis across an impressionable surface, such as a metal tablet covered by a thin layer of wax or hardened clay. (Wealthy Allatians sometimes wear a nib made of precious metals on the tip of the nose.) The writer speaks his thoughts as he writes, causing the proboscis to vibrate up and down as it etches a groove in the surface.
To read a book inscribed this way, an Allatian places his nose into the groove and drags it through. The delicate proboscis vibrates in sympathy with the waveform of the groove, and a hollow chamber in the Allatian skull magnifies the sound. In this manner, the voice of the writer is re-created.
The Allatians believe that they have a writing system superior to all others. Unlike books written in alphabets, syllabaries, or logograms, an Allatian book captures not only words, but also the writer’s tone, voice, inflection, emphasis, intonation, rhythm. It is simultaneously a score and a recording. A speech sounds like a speech, a lament a lament, and a story re-creates perfectly the teller’s breathless excitement. For the Allatians, reading is literally hearing the voice of the past.
But there is a cost to the beauty of the Allatian book. Because the act of reading requires physical contact with the soft, malleable surface, each time a text is read, it is also damaged and some aspects of the original irretrievably lost. Copies made of more durable materials inevitably fail to capture all the subtleties of the writer’s voice, and are thus shunned.
In order to preserve their literary heritage, the Allatians have to lock away their most precious manuscripts in forbidding libraries where few are granted access. Ironically, the most important and beautiful works of Allatian writers are rarely read, but are known only through interpretations made by scribes who attempt to reconstruct the original in new books after hearing the source read at special ceremonies.
For the most influential works, hundreds, thousands of interpretations exist in circulation, and they, in turn, are interpreted and proliferate through new copies. The Allatian scholars spend much of their time debating the relative authority of competing versions, and inferring, based on the multiplicity of imperfect copies, the imagined voice of their antecedent, an ideal book uncorrupted by readers.
***
The Quatzoli
The Quatzoli do not believe that thinking and writing are different things at all.
They are a race of mechanical beings. It is not known if they began as mechanical creations of another (older) species, if they are shells hosting the souls of a once-organic race, or if they evolved on their own from inert matter.
A Quatzoli’s body is made out of copper and shaped like an hourglass. Their planet, tracing out a complicated orbit between three stars, is subjected to immense tidal forces that churn and melt its metal core, radiating heat to the surface in the form of steamy geysers and lakes of lava. A Quatzoli ingests water into its bottom chamber a few times a day, where it slowly boils and turns into steam as the Quatzoli periodically dips itself into the bubbling lava lakes. The steam passes through a regulating valve—the narrow part of the hourglass—into the upper chamber, where it powers the various gears and levers that animate the mechanical creature.
At the end of the work cycle, the steam cools and condenses against the inner surface of the upper chamber. The droplets of water flow along grooves etched into the copper until they are collected into a steady stream, and this stream then passes through a porous stone rich in carbonate minerals before being disposed of outside the body.
This stone is the seat of the Quatzoli mind. The stone organ is filled with thousands, millions of intricate channels, forming a maze that divides the water into countless tiny, parallel flows that drip, trickle, wind around each other to represent simple values which, together, coalesce into streams of consciousness and emerge as currents of thought.
Over time, the pattern of water flowing through the stone changes. Older channels are worn down and disappear or become blocked and closed off—and so some memories are forgotten. New channels are created, connecting previously separated flows—an epiphany—and the departing water deposits new mineral growths at the far, youngest end of the stone, where the tentative, fragile miniature stalactites are the newest, freshest thoughts.
When a Quatzoli parent creates a child in the forge, its final act is to gift the child with a sliver of its own stone mind, a package of received wisdom and ready thoughts that allow the child to begin its life. As the child accumulates experiences, its stone brain grows around that core, becoming ever more intricate and elaborate, until it can, in turn, divide its mind for the use of its children.
And so the Quatzoli are themselves books. Each carries within its stone brain a written record of the accumulated wisdom of all its ancestors: the most durable thoughts that have survived millions of years of erosion. Each mind grows from a seed inherited through the millennia, and every thought leaves a mark that can be read and seen.
Some of the more violent races of the universe, such as the Hesperoe, once delighted in extracting and collecting the stone brains of the Quatzoli. Still displayed in their museums and libraries, the stones—often labeled simply "ancient books"—no longer mean much to most visitors.
Because they could separate thought from writing, the conquering races were able to leave a record that is free of blemishes and thoughts that would have made their descendants shudder.
But the stone brains remain in their glass cases, waiting for water to flow through the dry channels so that once again they can be read and live.
***
The Hesperoe
The Hesperoe once wrote with strings of symbols that represented sounds in their speech, but now no longer write at all.
They have always had a complicated relationship with writing, the Hesperoe. Their great philosophers distrusted writing. A book, they thought, was not a living mind yet pretended to be one. It gave sententious pronouncements, made moral judgments, described purported historical facts, or told exciting stories . . . yet it could not be interrogated like a real person, could not answer its critics or justify its accounts.
The Hesperoe wrote down their thoughts reluctantly, only when they could not trust the vagaries of memory. They far preferred to live with the transience of speech, oratory, debate.
At one time, the Hesperoe were a fierce and cruel people. As much as they delighted in debates, they loved even more the glories of war. Their philosophers justified their conquests and slaughter in the name of forward motion: War was the only way to animate the ideals embedded in the static text passed down through the ages, to ensure that they remained true, and to refine them for the future. An idea was worth keeping only if it led to victory.
When they finally discovered the secret of mind storage and mapping, the Hesperoe stopped writing altogether.
In the moments before the deaths of great kings, generals, philosophers, their minds are harvested from the failing bodies. The paths of every charged ion, every fleeting electron, every strange and charming quark, are captured and cast in crystalline matrices. These minds are frozen forever in that moment of separation from their owners.
At this point, the process of mapping begins. Carefully, meticulously, a team of master cartographers, assisted by numerous apprentices, trace out each of the countless minuscule tributaries, impressions, and hunches that commingle into the flow and ebb of thought, until they gather into the tidal forces, the ideas that made their originators so great.
Once the mapping is done, they begin the calculations to project the continuing trajectories of the traced out paths so as to simulate the next thought. The charting of the courses taken by the great, frozen minds into the vast, dark terra incognita of the future consumes the efforts of the most brilliant scholars of the Hesperoe. They devote the best years of their lives to it, and when they die, their minds, in turn, are charted indefinitely into the future as well.
In this way, the great minds of the Hesperoe do not die. To converse with them, the Hesperoe only have to find the answers on the mind maps. They thus no longer have a need for books as they used to make them—which were merely dead symbols—for the wisdom of the past is always with them, still thinking, still guiding, still exploring.
And as more and more of their time and resources are devoted to the simulation of ancient minds, the Hesperoe have also grown less warlike, much to the relief of their neighbors. Perhaps it is true that some books do have a civilizing influence.
***
The Tull-Toks
The Tull-Toks read books they did not write.
They are creatures of energy. Ethereal, flickering patterns of shifting field potentials, the Tull-Toks are strung out among the stars like ghostly ribbons. When the starships of the other species pass through, the ships barely feel a gentle tug.
The Tull-Toks claim that everything in the universe can be read. Each star is a living text, where the massive convection currents of superheated gas tell an epic drama, with the starspots serving as punctuation, the coronal loops extended figures of speech, and the flares emphatic passages that ring true in the deep silence of cold space. Each planet contains a poem, written out in the bleak, jagged, staccato rhythm of bare rocky cores or the lyrical, lingering, rich rhymes—both masculine and feminine—of swirling gas giants. And then there are the planets with life, constructed like intricate jeweled clockwork, containing a multitude of self-referential literary devices that echo and re-echo without end.
But it is the event horizon around a black hole where the Tull-Toks claim the greatest books are to be found. When a Tull-Tok is tired of browsing through the endless universal library, she drifts toward a black hole. As she accelerates toward the point of no return, the streaming gamma rays and x-rays unveil more and more of the ultimate mystery for which all the other books are but glosses. The book reveals itself to be ever more complex, more nuanced, and just as she is about to be overwhelmed by the immensity of the book she is reading, she realizes with a start that time has slowed down to standstill, and she will have eternity to read it as she falls forever towards a center that she will never reach.
Finally, a book has triumphed over time.
Of course, no Tull-Tok has ever returned from such a journey, and many dismiss their discussion of reading black holes as pure myth. Indeed, many consider the Tull-Toks to be nothing more than illiterate frauds who rely on mysticism to disguise their ignorance.
Still, some continue to seek out the Tull-Toks as interpreters of the books of nature they claim to see all around us. The interpretations thus produced are numerous and conflicting, and lead to endless debates over the books’ content and—especially—authorship.
***
The Caru’ee
In contrast to the Tull-Toks, who read books at the grandest scale, the Caru’ee are readers and writers of the minuscule.
Small in stature, the Caru’ee each measure no larger than the period at the end of this sentence. In their travels, they seek from others only to acquire books that have lost all meaning and could no longer be read by the descendants of the authors.
Due to their unimpressive size, few races perceive the Caru’ee as threats, and they are able to obtain what they want with little trouble. For instance, at the Caru’ee’s request, the people of Earth gave them tablets and vases incised with Linear A, bundles of knotted strings called quipus, as well as an assortment of ancient magnetic discs and cubes that they no longer knew how to decipher. The Hesperoe, after they had ceased their wars of conquest, gave the Caru’ee some ancient stones that they believed to be books looted from the Quatzoli. And even the reclusive Untou, who write with fragrances and flavors, allowed them to have some old bland books whose scents were too faint to be read.
The Caru’ee make no effort at deciphering their acquisitions. They seek only to use the old books, now devoid of meaning, as a blank space upon which to construct their sophisticated, baroque cities.
The incised lines on the vases and tablets were turned into thoroughfares whose walls were packed with honeycombed rooms that elaborate on the pre-existing outlines with fractal beauty. The fibers in the knotted ropes were teased apart, re-woven and re-tied at the microscopic level, until each original knot had been turned into a Byzantine complex of thousands of smaller knots, each a kiosk suitable for a Caru’ee merchant just starting out or a warren of rooms for a young Care’ee family. The magnetic discs, on the other hand, were used as arenas of entertainment, where the young and adventurous careened across their surface during the day, delighting in the shifting push and pull of local magnetic potential. At night, the place was lit up by tiny lights that followed the flow of magnetic forces, and long-dead data illuminated the dance of thousands of young people searching for love, seeking to connect.
Yet it is not accurate to say that the Caru’ee do no interpretation at all. When members of the species that had given these artifacts to the Caru’ee come to visit, inevitably they feel a sense of familiarity with the Caru’ee’s new construction.
For example, when representatives from Earth were given a tour of the Great Market built in a quipu, they observed—via the use of a microscope—bustling activity, thriving trade, and an incessant murmur of numbers, accounts, values, currency. One of the Earth representatives, a descendant of the people who had once knotted the string books, was astounded. Though he could not read them, he knew that the quipus had been made to keep track of accounts and numbers, to tally up taxes and ledgers.
Or take the example of the Quatzoli, who found the Caru’ee repurposing one of the lost Quatzoli stone brains as a research complex. The tiny chambers and channels, where ancient, watery thoughts once flowed were now laboratories, libraries, teaching rooms, and lecture halls echoing with new ideas. The Quatzoli delegation had come to recover the mind of their ancestor, but left convinced that all was as it should be.
It is as if the Caru’ee were able to perceive an echo of the past, and unconsciously, as they built upon a palimpsest of books written long ago and long forgotten, chanced to stumble upon an essence of meaning that could not be lost, no matter how much time had passed.
They read without knowing they are reading.
***
Pockets of sentience glow in the cold, deep void of the universe like bubbles in a vast, dark sea. Tumbling, shifting, joining and breaking, they leave behind spiraling phosphorescent trails, each as unique as a signature, as they push and rise towards an unseen surface.
Everyone makes books.#tools-for-thought

 What are startup cities for?


                  What are startup cities for?
                  

July 2nd, 2021
While the startup cities industry is still small, it is already quite heterogeneous. Each project has its own distinct set of goals, motivations, and scope. However, this diversity isn’t fully captured by the vocabulary we use right now.

To help myself create a mental map of the industry, I’ve grouped these motivations into 5 categories. I’ve also included examples of places that personify each motivation. (Some of those examples wouldn’t self-identify as "startup cities" but to me embody that spirit nonetheless.)

These motivations aren’t necessarily incompatible with each other. In fact, they're generally symbiotic, and I suspect most startup cities are motivated by many or all of them. The question is one of priority. Which of these goals is a project's main attractor for residents? Which are desirable but not central to the project's mission? The answers to those questions will determine the trade-offs each startup city will make.

I’m publishing this ontology for three reasons. I hope to:Create shared vocabulary so builders can communicate clearly with their residents, investors, team, and other stakeholders.Encourage builders to sharpen their focus on what they’re trying to do… and explicitly recognize what they’re not trying to do.Receive feedback about this list so that I can sharpen my own mental model about how various projects in the space relate to one another. I write to learn!
So let’s have at it! Here are the different categories of answers I’ve heard to the question "What are startup cities for?": Economic opportunity, Competitive governance, Lifestyle, Community, and Technological experimentation.Economic opportunity: Unleash economic development, reducing poverty and unemployment. Improve infrastructure, labor law, commercial law, tax structure, bureaucratic efficiency, etc in order to support employers in starting and operating businesses.The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was the testbed for market-oriented reforms that the Chinese government introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, which lifted 800 million people out of poverty. Shenzhen was able to innovate because the SEZ regime delegated almost all management authority to the provincial government, decoupling it from national policies.
Nkwashi's educational system will focus on growing Zambians to become software developers and digital designers, helping them access high-quality jobs.
Próspera is creating economic opportunity in Honduras by building better physical and legal infrastructure, and by diversifying the tourism-centric economy on Roatán, the Caribbean island where it’s located. Residents have access to high-quality remote jobs, fast wifi, dependable electricity, and potable water. Próspera has also streamlined processes such as registering a new business and hiring employees by building an entirely new legal, regulatory, and governance framework based on best practices from places like Dubai.Dubai pioneered the model of Free Zones, areas that experiment with policies that spur job creation. This UAE city has since become the center of commerce for all of Africa; for example, business people from Cairo and Lagos will meet in Dubai to make a deal, because its laws are good for doing business and better-trusted than those of their home countries. This has made the UAE immensely prosperous, with the 7th highest GDP per capita in the world (graph of UAE total GDP below).
Uruguay’s Free Trade Zones have become one of the main drivers of the Uruguayan economy. 29% of Uruguay’s exports in 2017 were sent from one of these free zones.
Competitive governance: Innovate on how governments deliver services to their residents, and in turn exert competitive pressure on other jurisdictions to push them to improve their services as well.Estonia offers 99% of its public services online, and it has an e-residency program that provides foreigners access to Estonia’s transparent business environment. I personally know Argentinians who've chosen to start businesses via e-Estonia because they trust it more than their local government.
Próspera is introducing new democratic institutions to Honduras, providing citizens new avenues for democratic political participation. For example, Próspera has something called a "snap referendum": any council action can be vetoed by popular referendum within 14 days, giving residents more sovereignty over their community than any other jurisdiction in Honduras. 
Ciudad Morazán has created a simplified version of Honduran law. I think of this as redesigning the law with "user experience" in mind, which is not legislators' typical framing when they write laws.
Lifestyle: Offer a different quality of life than what’s otherwise available to a potential resident.Gated communities are popular in Buenos Aires, a city where muggings and burglaries are common, because these private neighborhoods offer a safe place to raise a family.
Culdesac is building "the first car-free neighborhood built from scratch in the US" to provide Arizonans an alternative to the car-centric development in the rest of Tempe.
Ciudad Morazán is building a community that is safer and less polluted than other Honduran neighborhoods, where violent crime, littering, and poor sanitation are common.
Community: A place for like-minded people to live together.Chautauqua is a town in upstate NY that has a 9-week program each summer that offers sermons, lectures on a wide array of topics, operas, ballets, theatre, and beyond. This program attracts people with shared values and cultural preferences.
Praxis Society is "building a community founded on shared values, through online and in-person events. And simultaneously, [they are] also working on acquiring a beautiful piece of land and having everyone move there together."
Technological & social experimentation: Create a space for experimentation with everything from life-extension,  new forms of social structure, VTOLs, medical tourism, space travel, and beyond.The Seasteading Institute's goal is to develop "open spaces for experimenting with new societies" in order to "allow the next generation of pioneers to peacefully test new ideas for how to live together".
Cloud cities are the idea of bringing a community together on the internet first, and then collectively bargaining for a country or city to compete to govern in a way that serves that community's goals and values. After the cloud community successfully negotiates with a host government, they migrate there en masse. Balaji describes it like this: "If you can get 100k people in the cloud, making $100k annually each, you can simultaneously negotiate with 50 governments to legalize self-driving cars. Cloud first, land last."
Are there other motivations or examples that you would add to this list? Let me know!

=== thoughts-on-spaced-repetition.html === Thoughts on spaced repetition
 Thoughts on spaced repetition
                  Thoughts on spaced repetition
                  

July 24th, 2018
A common argument against spaced repetition goes something like this:
If an idea or fact is useful enough to memorize, your brain will retain it anyway. If it's important, it'll just stick, because you'll use it enough times.There's some validity to this. If you find it is really difficult to remember something, you may want to examine whether it's really worth expending that memorization effort. Maybe you just don't need to know it that badly.
However, this argument is quite weak in the general case.
For one, a lot of useful knowledge is retrieved in a pattern that is not conducive to remembering. Sometimes, you just use it once or at some point far into the future, or you can't afford to take the time to look it up. Despite its immense value at that moment, it's just not at your fingertips when you need it. The argument "you'll remember it if you need it because you'll have used it" only applies for certain types of often-retrieved knowledge.
Second, you probably don't want to just follow what your unconscious mind has chosen to prioritize. Sometimes it is what you want, but often it isn't. A big part of being an intelligent human is that you have the capability to reason through life rather than just following your gut. Take advantage of that! Take control of what information your mind retains. Instincts are useful, but they are often wrong for your self-defined goals. My instincts tell me to eat chocolate chip pancakes for every breakfast; that does not make it a good idea to start the day with dessert.
Finally, learning somewhat obscure facts whose usefulness is not immediately obvious may put you into a position where you're more likely to generate novel insights. When you're starting from a fresher set of facts, you effectively have a new perspective. It might allow you to draw analogies that other people won't see. (For example, I went through a phase when I was younger where I was obsessed with Tudor England. Most of that knowledge is not directly useful now, but it's surprising how often I draw from historical examples from that time. The dynamics of Henry VIII's court have useful parallels to all sorts of social and political situations, and it's fascinating to see what in human behavior holds holds constant and what does not.) By definition these are things that aren't directly useful day-to-day, but if you do have a grasp on them they might be surprisingly valuable ingredients for fresh insights into an old problem.
Epistemic effort: Low. I jotted up some handwritten notes a few weeks ago, typed them up today, and then cleaned up some of the language to make it a bit more clear. Overall I spent maybe an hour on this.#tools-for-thought

 Field notes: London, England

                  Field notes: London, England
                  

December 26th, 2018
I was in London for a conference for a few days in late October. The city was lovely, an unexpectedly nice place to wander. I came in with low expectations, expecting a drab, grey metropolis congested with traffic and filled with suited financiers scurrying from place to place. What I found was an agglomeration of charming urban villages, each with their own specific flavor. They were pedestrian-friendly, spotted with parks, and draped with trees, and the people-watching was great.

It's worth mentioning that (a) I primarily stayed on the north end of the river and (b) the weather was unusually sunny and warm for late October. In other words, I doubt I got a representative snapshot of London. Nevertheless, my brief exploration of London may have been my favorite city walk I've done.

Place names

For starters, place names in the UK are incredible. And by "incredible" I mean hard to believe. With a few of these I'd swear the Brits were screwing with me.
"Where did you go to school?"
"I went to Goodenough College."
"Haha, no but really."
"..."

Subtle
"Goodge Street"

Oh come on...

"The Ladbroke Arms"... but don't worry, he didn't break his legs.I guess they really liked sheep here at some point.
UPDATE: Anthony Hay, a native Londoner, reached out to me with some additions to the list of funny street signs that I found...
Place names:  there are many unusual street names in the City of London, including Bird-In-Hand Court, Bolt-In-Tun Yard, Crutched Friars, Ducks Foot Lane, French Horn Yard and Labour-In-Vain Court, as well as many food related ones including Beer Street, Bread Street, Camomile Street, Garlick Hill, Honey Lane, Lime Street, Milk Street, Oat Lane, Pie Corner, Poultry, Pudding Lane, Stew Lane and Sugar Loaf Court. (See maps.thehunthouse.com/eBooks/City_Street_Names.htm for much more information.)


Signage & wayfinding 
Great signage in general, both for clarity and entertainment!
"Open till late"... thanks for the specificity.
"It seems probable that the houses were erected in that year..."

"THIS IS NOT A STRIP CLUB"
Nice wayfinding in the Tube:
I love it when platform-specific metro maps show only the lines that are relevant to you from that location in the station.

Little language differences are always fun:
To let, or not to let. That is the question.
Oh dear! What frightened them?Brick size forensics
In the 1780s, Great Britain adopted a brick tax to help pay for the wars with the American colonies. Bricks were taxed at 4 shillings per thousand. 

In response, brick makers began to increase the size of their bricks. As a result, brick size can be used to date buildings. 

It was fun to keep an eye out for these jumbo bricks while exploring the city! In this picture (borrowed from Wikipedia because I forgot to take pictures), pre-brick tax bricks were used in the house on the right, while the building on the left were made with oversized bricks.WiFi names arms race
Lots of WiFi names begin with underscore to be first on list. Turns into a bit of an arms race though, because others can just put more underscores to get farther ahead on the list. There were a few cafes out of which I worked where the top 5 names with multi-underscore prefixes battling for first place. I wish I'd thought to screenshot one of these, but you get the idea with the one to the left here.
Riverfront 
London has not made much of its access to the Thames, especially compared to Paris' gorgeous Seine waterfront. The banks of the Thames are not nice places to hang out, at least the areas where I crossed. They are bordered with roads full of traffic, surrounded by sterile new towers with few cafes and activities.  UPDATE: Anthony Hay also had the following recommendations for better spots along the river—
Riverfront: there are plenty of places to enjoy the river front away from roads. The most central is on the south bank between County Hall (Westminster Bridge) and City Hall (Tower Bridge). This passes the National Theatre, the Royal Festival Hall, the Globe Theatre and Tate Modern as well as many pubs and cafes. My favourite is Battersea Park.

Narrow Streets for People
Wonderful examples of Narrow Streets for People!

Street details Reverse curb cuts: The road came up to meet the sidewalk in many places rather than having curb cuts. Easier to walk, especially for wheelchairs and strollers, and has the added benefit of being a small speed hump for cars. Nice little detail that shows that the neighborhood prioritizes pedestrians over cars.

Can be a little scary in some places though when drivers sped around the corner, since there's little stopping them from getting up on the curb. And of the places I've been London drivers were not the most careful...

My takeaway was that the efficacy of these reverse curb cuts depended a lot on specific conditions and implementation.
Crossing warnings: "LOOK LEFT" and "LOOK RIGHT" were painted wherever the crosswalk mets the street. Very helpful for a hapless American like me who kept looking the wrong way. 
Street trees: I expected London to have few trees from exploring it on Treepedia, so I was delighted to find that the neighborhoods I explored had many glorious trees. Treepedia gives it a "Green View Index" of 12.7%, which is on the lower end and doesn't match my experience. However these aren't really inconsistent because as you can see from the map the neighborhoods I wandered have some of the densest tree cover, especially Notting Hill. Guess I just got lucky!

Now on to the main event, the trees themselves...


Blocked off pedestrian street + walkway: pedestrians can walk through but cars cannot drive through. Lots of nice walking-friendly details like this throughout the city!


Curb cut grips: I can imagine that these grips are important when the ground is wet and slippery. Would not be fun to find yourself tripping into oncoming traffic...
UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who pointed out that this tactile paving is actually to help blind and partially-sighted people to identify safe crossings and various characteristics of the street. A good explainer video below: 
Sun-bleached paint: Looks like the sun bleached the black paint from the upper floors. You can tell this building has probably been around for a while.

Nice protected bike lanes! Impressed by the cycling infrastructure that I saw while walking from place to place, though I didn't get a chance to bike around much so I'm not sure how well-connected it all is.


Nice unassuming little plaza
Chimneys: Tons of chimneys! Not quite sure why. One guess is Victorian heating technology requires one per room, but many of the homes I saw otherwise look like they were built somewhat recently.


Private gardens & public parks
There are many private gardens in London. My initial reaction was sadness that they were exclusive, closed off to people who couldn't afford to pay the club dues, but then I realized they're at least better than private yards. They're a more efficient and cooperative solution than if each neighbor had their own, mostly-unused space behind their home, and they preserve green space in the city in a semi-public fashion without imposing a maintenance cost on the city. Plus, they are pleasant to walk by even if you can't go in.

London also has a lot of public parks as well, and they're great. They were small- to medium-sized and never a long walk away, which I prefer rather than one big green space for the whole city. Dotting a region with lots of small parks makes them more accessible for the average person, and there's something less relaxing about being in a park where you know half of the city is there with you on a sunny afternoon. It's nice to have the feeling of tight-knit, local community that you get from a smaller park. (It's worth noting that this goal is also helped with the existence of private community gardens.)

Not to say I dislike big parks. In fact, SF's Golden Gate Park is one of my favorite places in the city, and there is a qualitative difference to having lots of green space all at once, shielded from traffic and isolated from the rest of the metropolis. It's just a shame when it comes at the cost of excessive distance. So despite its size, Hyde Park ("London's "Central Park") is glorious on an autumn day. Wish I'd had time to take a run through it!Neighborhoods 
I enjoyed nearly all of the neighborhoods that I explored. Bloomsbury, Hyde Park, Soho, Notting Hill, and Mayfair were especially pleasant. 

The one exception was a brief stint walking around the South Bank, which was full of bland office spaces with little ground-floor retail or neighborhoods. Central Business Districts (CBDs) tend to feel quite unwelcoming, because there's not much happening at street level outside of work hours. This means that while many workers frequent the place all at once, there's not enough of a continuous stream of different kinds of people throughout the day to support interesting shops and activities. 

My hotel and the conference were near University College London, so I spent most of my time there. The neighborhood around was so charming! Lots of good energy from the university students, not far from the major International train stations, and lots of bookshops. I'll likely stay there again next time I go to London. 
Nice attempt at trying to get the temporary buildings to match the style of the old one...

The one dark spot on my stay in that neighborhood was one night I walked to a pharmacy a few blocks away from the hotel, and two men on a motorcycle drove up on the sidewalk and tried to snatch my phone out of my hand. I yanked it out of their grip and they zoomed off down the street. It all turned out fine—they didn't hurt me and they did not get my phone—but it was the first time anyone had tried to rob me, so it was quite startling. Also, had they made a small error, they could have hit me or run over my foot with their motorbike. It gives me the shivers to think about other branches of the multiverse.Bathroom access
Easy to find bathrooms while walking around, throughout the city core. I've been developing a rubric for comparing cities, and this experience was a good reminder to include "access to clean, public toilets" in it.


Prices, even very low prices, are an effective tool to discourage abuse. As a result, these public bathrooms on the perimeter of Hyde Park were clean and comfortable!
CleanlinessMost areas I explored around London were well-kept. (It's a large city and not Singapore, so I wouldn't use the word "clean", but it generally felt like folks took care of the place.) The one exception to this was walking down Edgeware Road after a delicious Lebanese dinner. Some folks call this neighborhood Little Beirut or Little Cairo. There had been a market of some sort that afternoon. Most merchants had already left, though a handful were finishing packing up. Many had just thrown their cardboard boxes, packaging, and other trash on the ground for someone else to clean up. It may be that the norms are for the market organizers to clean up after everyone else, but it seemed more an issue of lack of accountability. Either way, it made the road unpleasant that evening.Misc
Crutches and leg braces: I saw many more people with crutches and leg braces walking around than I typically see in San Francisco. It was a striking difference, so I don't think it was just a fluke. A few hypotheses:London is more walkable and its public transit is more accessible to people with disabilities, so people with mobility challenges go out more?Cheaper to get crutches/leg braces through the NHS? If this were the explanation, I would expect to see a similar effect in countries like France which also have socialized healthcare, and I did not notice that.It was just a statistical fluke. After all I was there for <1 week.For some reason I happened to notice a few people with crutches early on, and then I kept noticing them at a higher rate of observation than normal because they were top of mind.... curious if you have more info!
TV licenses and socialized healthcare: The people I hung out with while there were bitter towards the required TV licenses and "religion" for NHS in public discourse. Curious how widespread this attitude is.

Surveillance: CCTV cameras really are everywhere! No wonder so many dystopian films are set and created in the UK.

Indian food: Everyone complains about English cuisine, but what they forget is that you can eat Indian food every single day.
British women and their leopard print! I will never understand.
 
The Brunswick CentreThe Brunswick Centre seemed to be an attempt to re-create the feeling of a tight-knit neighborhood center. It was not great but not terrible. But also probably much more expensive and controversial to build.

That concrete and stucco facade does not age so nicely... 20th century architecture is rife with Chesterton's Fence situations when it comes to materials. Modernist designers chose the material of the age to stay on the cutting edge, choosing materials like concrete over brick concrete versus brick. Unfortunately in this case, the concrete has not aged nicely despite being just a few decades old, while the brick buildings that neighbor it are much older but have only gained more a sense of permanence.

Meanwhile the street next door is just so charming (pictured below ⤵). It's much more nondescript than the Brunswick Centre, which really stands out, but it's a welcoming place that's much better integrated into the neighborhood around it, in both aesthetic and accessibility terms. You can see the Centre to the left, while the right side is more traditional.


The same street, just facing the opposite direction. (The Brunswick Centre is just out of sight to the right.)

Noise 
The districts I wandered were about as dense as my neighborhood in San Francisco, yet much quieter. I believe this is mostly a function of many more people walking rather than driving, but I'm curious to learn if there are other factors too.

It was so peaceful that, while walking from St. Pancras train station to my hotel, I felt obliged to pick up my suitcase rather than roll it across the ground. It just felt rude to make that much noise. This would not be the case walking 10 minutes from the Caltrain station at 4th and King, that's for sure.London population density by borough, 2010
Population density by neighborhood in San Francisco, 2010

The comparison from square miles to square kilometers here is a bit unfortunate, so here's the conversion: 1mi² ≈ 2.6km²

Weather 
Several locals insisted that London's weather is not as bad as people think, it's just unpredictable and variable. A few other claims I've read/heard on the topic:
Some of the city's reputation is from its being smoggy as recently as 50 years, but only smokeless fuels have been used since 1956 and that has since cleared up.Rains frequently, but rarely heavilyGrey and muggySimilar annual precipitation to VancouverRarely gets below 0 degrees CelsiusLondon isn’t by far the rainiest city out there, and moreover, because it rains time and time again this makes England considerably warmer than it should have beenquora.com/Is-the-weather-in-London-really-that-bad

Oblique light 
What struck me more than the weather was the light. It's easy to forget how much farther north Europe is relative to my expectations based on the equivalent latitude in the US. Intuitively, London feels to me like it is roughly at the same latitude as New York, but NYC's latitude is actually closer to that of the heel of Italy, while London is further north than Vancouver, Canada.The result is that the sun is weak, even at high noon, because it's at more of an oblique angle on the horizon. The entire afternoon feels like a long dusk, and the golden hour is more like 2+ hours. 

It's amazing how much the Gulf Stream moderates the climate of Western Europe. According to Weather Online, "Without this steady stream of warmth the British Isles winters are estimated to be more than 5° C cooler, bringing the average December temperature in London to about 2° C."

Transport systemsLondon taxis are custom-designed to have a tight turning radius of only 25 ft for the narrow streets of London. (h/t to Jose Luis for this fact!) Some sources cite that it was purpose-built to accommodate the small roundabout at the entrance of the Savoy Hotel, but given that the tight turning radius is legally required of London taxis I find this a bit far-fetched. More likelySeems like they are in some sort of transition for the address system.Google maps has letters and numbers, but when you get to the street there is a typical name.While researching this question, I found that London's postal system is rather unique: tripsavvy.com/london-postcodes-info-1583386Long stop lights (explanation from email... separate post linked to and from Manchester post!)One-trip tickets on the Tube were surprisingly expensive, £4.90. This is likely a form of price discrimination for tourists, as the cost for the Oyster and Contactless payment cards is much lower.Great trains! I flew into Manchester and took a train into London (because flights to London were shockingly expensive... 10x the usual!). It was smooth and comfortable, much better than going in and out of airports for a short flight. It was a Virgin Pendolino, apparently some of the best trains on the line.
Miscellaneous architecture

Stunning!

Not sure what's going on here but it's interesting.
UPDATE: @Alby pointed out that these buildings are "built in the shells of old gasometers"!
UPDATE: Anthony Hay again:
[These are] the Gasholders development which consists of luxury flats built inside former gasholders. (See gasholderslondon.co.uk). The gasholders were originally located close by and stored gas that was produced by what was London's largest gas works, operated by the Imperial Gas, Light and Coke Company.

Candy cane buildings

UPDATE: @em_de6 pointed out that this pedestrian bridge connects the Royal Ballet School to the Royal Opera House. A few more photos from the developer's site:

 I of course didn't see everything London has to offer, so keep that in mind that these observations may not (and likely do not) generalize! To get a sense of where I actually spent my time here's my Google Timeline from those few days in London:DAY 1: Sunday 21 Oct

 Japanese street networks


                  Japanese street networks
                  

May 22nd, 2018
I originally published this in May of last year in Idea Collector, one of my old blogs.
Epistemic status: This is a quick write up of my personal experience wandering Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo last May. I'd be curious to learn how it compares to objective measures, models, others' experience, and so on!
Epistemic effort: I noted my impressions in bullet-point form while wandering around the cities, then when I returned from the trip I spent ~1h turning those messy notes into a form that might actually make sense to a non-Devon.
Street networks in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo are highly connected. The streets are narrow, and the blocks are short, which feels more human-scale and creates more opportunity for diversity. Pedestrians feel comfortable in these dense networks, which encourages walking and biking.

.
This Kyoto side street would barely be enough space between buildings to conform to most American zoning codes, let alone to count as a street.
.

.
Short blocks break the social isolation of wide, long streets. Pedestrians are more likely to stop by a shop as they walk past than if they were driving, and by permitting alternative travel routes and shortening the travel distance from nearby places, short blocks open greater access to stores and services.This mid-sized street in Japan would be a small alley in an American city. Cars go both directions, so they are careful. This makes pedestrians and cyclists comfortable to walk in the middle of the street (like you can seen in the picture above!). White lines delineate the center from the sides, which helps separate traffic and pedestrians when need be, but people are as if not more welcome than cars here.
.

It’s useful to contrast these human-scale streets with their American counterparts. San Francisco’s South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood is an interesting case. The district’s legacy as an industrial zone left it with wide streets and longer blocks, and the effect is that pedestrians feel like second-class citizens. The 280 and 101 freeways furher emphasize this isolation by slicing right through the neighborhood.
It’s no coincidence that the SF neighborhoods people most often describe as "charming" are the ones whose with smaller streets and shorter blocks. These tend to be the older ones north of Market St like Hayes Valley, NoPa, Cole Valley, and Lower Pacific Heights.
Thanks to Geoff Boeing for his awesome street network visualizer tool!

                  On [there being more than] liberty
                  

September 9th, 2019
Recently, Ayaz Matin sent me an email asking the following question:When I was looking at your website I came across these words:
Individual liberty is the single most important value that society should uphold.I’m more utilitarian and communitarian now.I still believe we should be extremely skeptical of sacrificing individual liberties for the sake of a greater good (in practice if not in theory), but I no longer hold liberty as sacrosanct.This was interesting to read because I also was on this journey where I believed in individual liberty as being most important for a long time but over the last 2-3 years have started to question it, and have become a tad bit more communitarian.
I would love to hear about your experiences or the thought process which led you to question the long held beliefs and change your views.The remainder of this post is the response I shared with him (slightly modified for clarity).

~ ~ ~

It's always tenuous to explain why someone changed their mind—especially your own, since it's so easy to delude yourself—but I'll give it a try!

There wasn't a single lightbulb moment. Rather, it was a combination of several new frames of reference + a shift in my underlying values to which I only put a name after the fact + a radical change in my context.


I. New frames of reference
Some of the key new frames of reference I gained were:

1. Intuition about externalities
I internalized the significance of externalities in a far more profound way. I mostly picked up this frame up reference through more plain old life experience and recognizing more instances of positive/negative externalities in day-to-day life. 

Moving to a city especially drove this home. The side effects of others' behavior (and your own!) become self-evident when you live in close proximity to many people. Every time a motorcycle roars down my street at 3am, I'm reminded yet again that externalities are real and omnipresent.


2. The framing of "coordination problems"
I learned the concept of coordination problems. This helped me see that some circumstances can systematically result in suboptimal outcomes for individual agents even when they're behaving in their own best interest.

I came to pick up this concept through stumbling upon game theory, studying it, and then extending its implications to daily life. I just plain didn't have this label when I was 16 years old, so it was much harder to recognize the importance of this category of problems, which meant my views didn't address them. I now can't help but see instances of this category everywhere!


3. Personal experience of working in a pack for the first time, rather than as a lone wolf
I personally experienced the feeling of joy that comes from being embedded in the fabric of a team that's greater than the sum of its parts. For contrast, I also saw people who I care about experience (and to some extent also personally experiencing myself) the isolation that can come about from being excessively independent. 

This transition in my thinking occurred because I went from schoolwork, where excelling is a very individual activity, to actual work in the real world, where you really can't get much done without coordinating with other talented people.


II. Underlying shifts in values

Here are some other changes more as shifts in my underlying values, which are harder to explain from the result of specific events:


4. Physical laws aren't such a useful analogy for moral systems 
16-year-old Devon thought of morals as something that could be reducible to axioms, much in the way that physics/mechanics is reducible to basic laws. I thought that moral axioms of some sort were "out there to be discovered", independent of whether or not humans followed them, sort of like how physics is real even if you don't believe it it. (It's not a coincidence this happened around the time I started to study physics.) 

I came to realize that this was wishful thinking and not actually a "correct" way to view the world. Sure it'd be nice if morality were that simple—just find the Newtonian laws or Maxwell's equations for ethics, and you're good to go!—but that doesn't mean that's actually the way things work. I realized I couldn't actually think of a reason why moral laws would be discoverable and "out there to be discovered" in the same way the laws of physics were, so I stopped believing it. 

This was a more gradual process than I've made it sound... there was no epiphany moment, the fact that what I believed was groundless over time steadily came into focus.


5. Preference utilitarianism as a new (theoretical) North Star
Related to the previous point, I now view preference utilitarianism as a more appropriate way to judge actions, at least theoretically. I don't think it's practical to actually know what everyone's preferences are, let alone to calculate them all out when deciding your own course of action, but in theory I do think it's the proper thing to strive for. At the very least it's a useful debugger. (I'll write more on that at some point in the future.) 

The best (worst?) part is that it's nicely circular: my preference is for the world to maximize preference utility for all other conscious beings on earth, so within that system it's by definition correct! (Whether it's actionable is a different question...) This means it avoids the trap of "discoverable axioms" and the physical laws analogy mentioned above.


6. I downgraded the importance of consistency 
I now value intellectual/moral consistency far less than I once did. I used to think consistency was paramount, that if you were inconsistent then you must change your views to become consistent, and in turn to be moral. Now, I see consistency as a useful heuristic but not the be-all-end all. All things equal, consistency is still something to strive for, but all things are not equal. Life is full of uncertainty, so if you enforce consistency on all your beliefs then you're most likely to just be wrong about everything. All it takes is for your assumptions to be slightly off for you to now get everything wrong. Relaxing that constraint of consistency gives you more opportunity to error correct. And there will certainly be errors—it's foolish to think it's possible to always be correct—so error correction is crucial for having any hope of "correctness", whatever that means.

It's like if you're trying to get from point A to point B, and you know a few landmarks along the way but you don't know exactly how to get there. If you go in exactly the direction of the first landmark you see and refuse to change course when you see another one at a slightly different angle, then you're going to be way off base the farther away from your starting point you get. If you instead update your angle each time you see another landmark a bit off the mark from what you remembered, you'll zig zag a bit, but you'll end up heading in the roughly right direction on average. (Though of course you're totally screwed if you don't notice the landmarks in the first place!) Just like these sanity checks are crucial for effective navigation, they're also crucial for your moral judgements. If you're doing something because it's consistent with your other actions, but it feels like the outcome is horrible for the world, then that's good reason to change the action or at least reflect on it long and hard.


III. Changes in context
And finally here are the changes in context that had a big impact, most obvious being that I'm no longer an undergrad at a university in the SF Bay Area:

7. My identity is less centered on intellectual edginess than it once was
Here's the most cynical answer: I came to care less about "edginess" in my views than I did in high school and college. Valuing individual liberty above all else was controversial in my college environment. I was hooked on the feeling of being different and borderline extreme, and now I really care so much less. That's probably because I have more things on which to peg my identity and feelings of self worth than my opinions. I actually build things and make things happen in the world now! Far more satisfying than writing op-eds in a fringe college newspaper. Not to say that wasn't a good use of my time back then—I'm very glad I did it—but I'm glad that wasn't my peak.

8. When playing the part of Devil's Advocate, I accidentally became a method actor
I often play Devil's Advocate when I think a useful perspective was omitted from the conversation. When I see a conversation has gone too far in one direction, I often pull it in the other direction to give it more balance. Historically, I thought it would be necessary to make a more extreme argument than what I actually believed in the hope it'll average out. (It's a whole other conversation as to whether that's an effective strategy...)

For example, at Stanford there's a widespread, deeply-rooted belief across most of the students and faculty that guns can only be bad, and that the world would obviously be better off if we straight up banned them. My intuition was actually not that far off from that, but it was disturbing that no one around me questioned this dogma. And it was even more disturbing as I dug into it and found that my peers held this belief without actually having spent any time thinking about it. So I dove into research and made the case for why guns, concealed carry permits, etc were actually a great idea. I actually was not personally convinced that they're a great idea per se, but I was sure that (a) they're not literally the devil like the people around me thought they were and (b) they have some societal value, even if it's small. So I wanted to cause people to examine their beliefs a bit more and make the case, since it seemed like no one else was going to do it. I value having the best case made for every idea, no matter how terrible it is, so that the world can judge it as best as possible, and I saw a big gap for that particular issue (as well as others). That said, I mixed up trying to pull the Overton Window in a particular direction with actually holding the extreme view.

Now with this framing, let's zoom back out to the question "why the emphasis on liberty?". It's because that dimension seemed to be drastically undervalued by my peers and role models. The folks I knew in the Bay Area tended to suggest more government as the solution to most problems, and that seemed like to automatic an answer to me, so I wanted to challenge that. The people I work with most closely/spend time with now don't have nearly as strong a tendency to default to more government control, so I feel less a need to challenge them on that.

~ ~ ~

It'll be interesting to see how my perspective continues to change in the coming years. 🙂 #libertarian

You can download my complete list of subscriptions as an opml file or as more readable json.You should be able to load the opml into most podcast apps by going into Settings and finding some sort of "import" button.As a warning, there are 100+ subscriptions in there of varying quality, so you may not want to import it directly.To narrow it down a bit from that massive list, I highly recommend the following podcasts:Rationally Speaking — This is one of the best interview shows out there. Julia is great at facilitating deep, thoughtful conversations, and her guests are consistently fantastic. This podcast has made me a far more rigorous thinker. It offers a wide set of tools for improving your critical thinking, examples of applied rationality, and a useful view of the philosophy and history of science. The interviews also cover a broad range of topics, which can be a great jumping off point for diving deep into something else new and interesting.99% Invisible — A show "about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about — the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world."Reply All — It’s a show "about how people shape the internet, and the internet shapes people".Conversations with Tyler–I said that Rationally Speaking was "one of" the best interview shows out there, because Conversations with Tyler is the other best one. Tyler Cowen’s questions are just fantastic, and he is great at articulating and teasing out the nuance in any topic. (Also, if you don’t already read his blog Marginal Revolution, you’re missing out. Go read it now.)Backstory with the American History Guys — "A podcast that brings historical perspective to the events happening around us today. On each show, renowned U.S. historians Ed Ayers, Peter Onuf, and Brian Balogh tear a topic from the headlines and plumb its historical depths. Over the course of the hour, they are joined by fellow historians, people in the news, and callers interested in exploring the roots of what’s going on today. Together, they drill down to colonial times and earlier, revealing the connections (and disconnections) between past and present."Gastropod — "Food with a side of science and history. Every other week, co-hosts Cynthia Graber and Nicola Twilley serve up a brand new episode exploring the hidden history and surprising science behind a different food- or farming-related topic, from aquaculture to ancient feasts, from cutlery to chile peppers, and from microbes to Malbec. We interview experts, visit labs, fields, and archaeological digs, and generally have lots of fun while discovering new ways to think about and understand the world through food."StartUp — "StartUp is a podcast series about what it’s really like to get a business off the ground. In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network. In Season 2, Lisa Chow joined Alex to follow an entirely new company: a company called Dating Ring, founded by two women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley."Radiolab — "Radiolab is a show about curiosity. Where sound illuminates ideas, and the boundaries blur between science, philosophy, and human experience."Under the Influence — "A show that gives you a rare backstage pass into the hallways, boardrooms and recording studios of the ad industry."The Pulse — "Stories at the heart of health, science, and innovation."The Bike Shed — Thoughtbot’s podcast about their "development experience and challenges with Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and whatever else is drawing their attention, admiration, or ire this week". This is my favorite technical podcast, because it does a good job of balancing interesting details with working well within the audio medium.Hidden Brain — "Using science and storytelling, Hidden Brain reveals the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior, the biases that shape our choices, and the triggers that direct the course of our relationships."Vox’s The Weeds — "Everyone is always warning you not to get lost in the weeds. But not Vox’s Ezra Klein, Sarah Kliff, and Matthew Yglesias. They love the weeds. That’s where all the policy is. This is the podcast for people who follow politics because they love thinking about health care, economics, and zoning. It is not podcast for people who like hearing talk about gaffes."The Psychology of Attractiveness — "A show that reveals the science behind human sexuality." It is hosted by Dr. Robert Burriss, a psychology researcher at Basel University in Switzerland.Surprisingly Awesome — "There are a lot of things out in the world that sound boring, but when you dig in deeper, you discover that actually, they are fascinating. … Surprisingly Awesome is a show full of stories like this. Stories about things that sound totally boring, but turn out to be totally awesome."Planet Money — "Imagine you could call up a friend and say, "Meet me at the bar and tell me what’s going on with the economy." Now imagine that’s actually a fun evening. That’s what we’re going for at Planet Money."Freakonomics Radio — "Surprising conversations that explore the riddles of everyday life and the weird wrinkles of human nature — from cheating and crime to parenting and sports."What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law — "Professor Elizabeth Joh teaches Intro to Constitutional Law and most of the time this is a pretty straight forward job. But with Trump in office, everything has changed. Five minutes before class Professor Joh checks Twitter to find out what the 45th President has said and how it jibes with 200 years of the judicial branch interpreting and ruling on the Constitution. Hosted by acclaimed podcaster Roman Mars (99% Invisible, co-founder Radiotopia), this show is a weekly, fun, casual Con Law 101 class that uses the tumultuous and erratic activities of the executive branch under Trump to teach us all about the US Constitution."This American Life — "We’re not a news show or a talk show or a call-in show. We’re not really formatted like other radio shows at all. Instead, we do these stories that are like movies for radio. There are people in dramatic situations. Things happen to them. There are funny moments and emotional moments and — hopefully — moments where the people in the story say interesting, surprising things about it all. It has to be surprising. It has to be fun."Invisibilia — "We explore the invisible forces that shape human behavior — things like ideas, beliefs, assumptions and emotions. … We weave incredible human stories with fascinating new psychological and brain science, in the hopes that after listening, you will come to see new possibilities for how to think, behave and live."Direct Current — A podcast from the U.S. Department of Energy. "[It] is a podcast about energy — the kind that lights our homes, powers our lives and shapes our world. From the U.S. Department of Energy’s digital team in Washington, D.C., Direct Current brings you fresh, insightful stories of how we generate and use electricity, what that means for the planet and the cutting-edge science that’s driving a global energy revolution."More Perfect — "Supreme Court decisions shape everything from marriage and money to public safety and sex. We know these are very important decisions we should all pay attention to — but they often feel untouchable and even unknowable. Radiolab’s first ever spin-off series, More Perfect, connects you to the decisions made inside the court’s hallowed halls, and explains what those rulings mean for "we the people" who exist far from the bench. More Perfect bypasses the wonkiness and tells stories behind some of the court’s biggest rulings."Podcast apps:iPhone: The default podcast app is fine, but I recommend replacing it with Overcast or Castro. The default feels like a generic utility, whereas the other two are built with podcast users specifically in mind. Overcast has a broader range of features, but Castro has beautifully designed user interactions and a more thoughtful interface. My hope is that Castro incorporates some of the other features over time, since they only just released the app this month.Android: When I had an Android, I used the Stitcher app. As of a year and a half ago (when I switched to an iPhone), that app was pretty terrible, but I don’t have other recommendations and it’s probably (hopefully) improved since then.
Audiobooks
I can’t easily create an audiobook starter kit, because unlike podcasts they aren’t free and they are siloed within services like Audible rather than an open format like RSS. Luckily, audiobook discovery has a lot in common with book discovery, which is a largely solved problem. You can start by just finding the audio format for a book you’ve been meaning to read.
Anyways, here’s a list of a few of my favorite audiobooks, and if any of them pique your interest, let me know — Audible members can send their books to friends for free (one book per friend), and I’m happy to share mine with you if you want.The Power Broker — This biography of Robert Moses is single-handedly responsible for my obsession with cities, and the narrator of the audiobook is a great voice actor.Age of Ambition — "A vibrant inner history of China during a moment of profound transformation."Season of the Witch — This book is a history of San Francisco, but feels more like fantasy about a dreamland than a dry history textbook. It weaves a tapestry of they city’s history through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, and it’s a stunning performance to listen to.The Golden Compass — This audiobook is narrated by the author Philip Pullman, and each character in the story is voiced by a different actor from a London Shakespeare troupe. I adored the printed book, re-reading it at least half a dozen times when I was younger, but the audiobook is be even better.I also highly recommend the Amazon’s Whispersync. It allows you to switch seamlessly between reading the Kindle edition of a book and listening to its Audible adaptation, and it’s usually only a few dollars more than buying just one format (rather than doubling the cost).This is particularly useful for non-fiction books. As I noted earlier, my listening comprehension isn’t nearly as good as my reading comprehension, and searching over audio is a problem without great consumer solutions.The user interface is extremely well-designed, and the transitions between reading and listening are smooth and feel very natural. It’s such a great user experience, and it brings the best of both audio and text content.I highlight everything I read extensively so I can go back and reread the best bits. When I first started listening to audiobooks, my biggest regret was that I couldn’t annotate them easily. Whispersync has totally solved this problem.

Cities are fractal. You can always go a layer deeper and there’s just as much complexity. 

Following this principle, I sometimes think it might make sense to just stay in San Francisco my whole life and explore the infinite levels of that fractal. It’s cheaper than interstate or international travel anyway, and according to this framework you get the same amount of interestingness no matter how many levels deep you go. 

The catch is that when you stay in one place it's too easy to accidentally fall into a rut and not actual get the most out of the levels available to you. So while it may be theoretically possible to see a wide variety of things and learn things at different levels by staying within the limits of a single city, you’re much less likely to surface those experiences because it’s easy to build up habits, a pattern of behavior that cut off interesting discoveries. This is an obstacle rather than a theoretical limit.

The other possible takeaway from viewing cities as fractals is that it doesn't matter how much time you spend in one. There'll always been an infinite amount of people, places, subcultures, foods, and more that you didn't get to experience. In other words, the one-day-per-city approach was fine for my recent trip to Asia. The limit on it is less how much you can see in a day (per its scale-free nature) and more how exhausting it can be to go from place to place. The main bottleneck here is the logistics, cost, and physical exhaustion. I wasn't responsible for planning the trip, which minimized these problems; if I had to organize the logistics of getting to/from the airport, lining up the schedule, etc, I would have wanted more breathing room in the schedule.

Of course I’d like to have spent more time in each city, but there would still be an infinite number of things I’ve missed. If you can reduce the overhead constant costs (which is a big "if"), there's no such a thing as spending too little (or too much!) time in a single city. There's always another layer deeper you can go.

 Language is like choosing which side of the street to drive on


                  Language is like choosing which side of the street to drive on
                  

November 17th, 2018
A debate I’ve come across again and again is whether language is objective or subjective. It tends to crop up in moments like when dictionaries update the word "literally" with contradictory definitions or when people argue that Ebonics isn't "correct" English. 

The working definitions we'll use:objective: something that can be correct or incorrect, i.e. really out there in the world independent of whether or not you perceive itsubjective: something that is up to interpretation, i.e. your personal experience of something
On one hand, it's clearly possible to have different levels of mastery over language—some people are better communicators than others, and it's a skill that can be learned. On the other hand, everyone has their own style and taste, and language is subject to constant evolution and experimentation. Neither "objective" nor "subjective" is really the right category, but we tend to argue about it at this binary level.

Language is more like choosing which side of the street to drive on. Language can be "correct" in the same way that it's "correct" to drive the left in the UK and on the right in the US while the reverse is "wrong".

There is no empirical, moral, or theoretical law of the universe that forces it to be one or the other. These are just norms, decided and agreed upon by society. They're not objective in the sense that Americans are doing it wrong or that the Brits discovered some secret of the universe (nor vice versa).

However these norms are also not subjective in the sense that you can just choose to not believe them. Deviating is costly. If you drive on the left in America, you're gonna have a hard time. If you drive on the right in Britain, expect to be honked at angrily. It may have been a matter of chance that things ended up one way or another, but that doesn't make the consequences any less real.

Many aspects of daily life are like this. What they have in common is there's not one "right" answer, but it does matter that everyone is coordinated with the same set of expectations and you don't get to just ignore the consequences of deviating. Other examples that come to mind:The location of a market: It doesn't really matter on what downtown block you put the Farmers Market, but you want all of the sellers and buyers to end up in the same place. If you wake up Sunday morning and decide that it's outside your front door rather than 10 blocks away where everyone else agreed to meet, sorry but you're not going to get your organic squash.Electrical outlet standards: Within a most countries you can assume that anywhere you go will conform to the same plug, socket, and voltage standards. It doesn't really matter what those standards are, as long as you and the society around you agree on one standard. Notably, like deciding which side of the road to drive on, the intersubjective truth of what is the "right" plug differs from country to country. (Note: Differing from country to country is a hint that something is an intersubjective truth!)What counts as "proper" grammar: You can choose to be relativistic with your semantics, but you shouldn't be surprised if people judge you for it or have a hard time understanding you. (Descriptive, not normative!) Grammatical rules differ from group to group. What matters is that they can communicate effectively when they need to.Whether your vocabulary is understood by others: You can choose to coin new words or throw in vocab from other languages, but you shouldn't be surprised if people don't understand what you mean. You may have a shared vocabulary with friends that constitutes an intersubjective truth, while the rest of the world doesn't get it. It doesn't make it false, but it's not objective either.Of course the options for each of these examples have design tradeoffs too. The choices aren't totally arbitrary, and there may be legitimate reasons one option is better than another. The point is that, for the most part, the "right" choice for an individual is determined by the standard the rest of the group established, not by a fact of nature or by a personal preference.

I was excited to learn a useful word to label this category recently: "intersubjective", which means "Involving or occurring between separate conscious minds; accessible to or capable of being established for two or more subjects". For ages I just thought that my inability to categorize language as one of "objective" or "subjective" was a failure of imagination. Upon discovering this word I realized that it's in a wholly separate category. Language is intersubjective, as are markets, electrical outlet standards, and much, much more. It's amazing how finding the right word can illuminate a concept that's been forming in your head for years!

A few fun thoughts to chew on:Does reality include intersubjectivity? I like Philip K. Dick's definition: "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." Following this, subjectivity and objectivity are both part of reality. I'm satisfied with this working definition, because it also explains why so many people seem to want to insist that language is "objective". My impression is that they actually mean to say that it's "part of reality", i.e. you can't change it, but they don't have the words to distinguish between that and objectivity.I'm using the term "intersubjective" somewhat differently than how others often use it. If you think I'm abusing the definition or overloading the term too much here, let me know! Words are important.All of our beliefs about what is objective actually stem from intersubjectivity. (And if you want to dive even deeper, all intersubjectivity derives from subjectivity...) We are more confident that something is objective the more others agree with us, but we can never be entirely sure that it's not a mass delusion.

Thanks to Dandelion Mane for introducing me to the term "intersubjectivity"! This concept had been bouncing around in my head for years, and finally I have a label for it.
Epistemic effort: I did a 1h quickwrite to brain dump my thoughts on the subject, then I spent one evenings revising it so it actually made sense.#labels

 Georgist land taxes balance community benefit & the efficiency of markets

                  Georgist land taxes balance community benefit & the efficiency of markets
                  

July 13th, 2024
One thing I like about Georgist land taxes is they reflect a deep-seated intuition many people have that land should be owned by the community, while still employing markets to ensure efficient use of this limited resource.

People feel that land is special and should serve the collective good and reflect community interests. This intuition manifests in behaviors like NIMBYism, where residents oppose changes to their neighborhood and try to stop people from doing what they want to their own property. These behaviors essentially reflect a belief that they as a community have rights over the property in question, even if they don't own it.

One reaction is to scoff at this behavior, because it violates a basic interpretation property rights. But another reaction is to ask ourselves, why do people have such strong intuitions that land is different than other forms of property?

One way in which natural resources (including land) are qualitatively different than other forms of property is that you can't make more of them (with minor exceptions). As a result, natural resources aren't the fruits of someone's labor.

One reaction is to say that no one should be able to individually own them, and that they should be collectively owned by the community. However, the history of the 20th century shows us that giving over the land to the state isn't a great idea either – governments aren't exactly known for making best use of opportunities to their best and highest use, to say the least!

Henry George proposed a different solution – tax the land rent while allowing private ownership. Land rent is the value of the property created by society rather than individual landowners (e.g. its location, views, and other natural resources), so taxing it would essentially recapture this socially-created value for public benefit.

While society is recapturing the socially-created value of the land, use of the land is in the hands of private actors who have the incentive to use it efficiently, so the system maintains the productivity benefits of private ownership while addressing issues of unearned wealth.

Markets are still generally the best tools we have for organizing human activity and resources, so by allowing private actors to own land but then simply tax them on the land rent leaves us with the best of both worlds!#taxes

February 2nd, 2018
Most people seem to think of themselves as "at the edge" of several communities rather than defined by a single identity. It’s easy to think of yourself as special and that other people are more singularly defined, but that’s a bias stemming from the fact that you’re mostly seeing people in the context of just one of the communities they’re a part of. It can be hard to remember: you just don’t have visibility into their other thoughts and other aspects of their life.#shower-thoughts

 City review: A day in Beijing


                  City review: A day in Beijing
                  

March 17th, 2018
I spent Monday, 5 March 2018 in Beijing. The urbanist nerd inside of me was thrilled to see China’s capital. I’d read so much about its astounding growth and change in the past few decade—finally a chance to see it firsthand! I was also excited for the food, to get a sense of daily life, and of course to build my mental map of the city.My key takeaway is that Beijing is an epicenter of cultural and technological change, but the experience of being in the city is very unpleasant. It would have to undergo dramatic changes for me to consider living there.

It’s a very no-nonsense city. The focus seems to be on destinations rather than pathways, both in the literal sense for transit and in the abstract sense. The city and nation are changing rapidly. Residents are not only willing to accept this but are also willing to sacrifice certain comforts to sustain that change. It probably helps that China was very poor and underdeveloped (and in many places still is), so it’s not so much a sacrifice as a continuation of discomforts with the promise of future improvement.

Beijing isn’t a place you really want to be outside, even in fancy areas of the city or private gardens. I usually love walking everywhere, but by the end of the day I was thrilled to get off the sidewalk and into a private car. Perhaps my experience was colored by it being a chilly day (I wore a peacoat, scarf, and gloves the entire time and was still uncomfortably cold in the late afternoon), but apparently the air was clearer than usual, so if anything I’d expect spending time outside to usually be even more unpleasant.

The city appeared to be getting richer right before my eyes. It was quite a sight to see. Unfortunately, it seems this wealth will only exacerbate the things I found most unpleasant, at least in the short- and mid-term: the traffic, the pollution, the expansion of highways.

Reading
BooksOn China by Henry Kissinger. I enjoyed this book much more than I expected. Kissinger’s personal interpretation of events was fascinating, both from the perspective of learning about China and also as a reminder that world leaders are individual people who lack omniscience just like everyone else. One of the most striking takeaways was what Kissinger calls the "triangulation" in which Mao Zedong played the Americans and Russians off against each other, bolstering China's relatively weak position and enabling it to behave as a third Superpower.Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China by Evan Osnos. This is a great set of individual stories that helped me weave a mental tapestry of China with a lot more depth than a high level history would have done. It almost feels like an ethnography, but it has a sense of rigor too. Highly recommend!Street of Eternal Happiness: Big City Dreams Along a Shanghai Road by Rob Schimtz. This one was a bit poetic for my tastes, but other people might enjoy it!Articles China’s anti-pollution war uses 60,000+ soldiers, artillery, and planes for tree planting and rain making from Next Big Future10 Chinese Megacities to See Before You Die from BloombergWhat’s the biggest limit on city growth? from McKinseyChina’s $290 Billion New Area Lifts Hope for Better Cities from BloombergHow a ban is forcing China’s single women to put their fertility on ice overseas from South China Morning PostBeijing’s vehicles
There was a huge range of transport modes, and there was a clear hierarchy. Private cars were at the top, the most aspirational way to get around. For people who have to get around with flexibility and capacity but can’t afford a full-fledged car, they had these small motorized vehicles that had less insulation, far fewer safety features, lower horsepower, and worse style. Students and young people were often on bikes, though so were older people had few alternatives. People only seemed to walk if they were tourists or going to/from public transit. (Note: This is all just impressions from a single day of walking around the city, not broad a broad data-driven meta-analysis. I’d be super curious to learn more about how Beijingers make transport choices, if anyone has research into the question!)

I may have seen more different modes of transit in the single day I was in Beijing than I had in the previous 23 years of my life. Makes me wonder why it was so varied—as the first place I visited on this trip, I thought maybe it was just because China is relatively poorer than the US, so people have to be more creative with their transportation solutions. But that’s not a satisfactory answer, because the diversity was so much higher than Jakarta, Saigon, and Bangalore, which are also much poorer than the US.

The range of options was even more striking after visiting the other four cities, which had not nearly as broad a range. I’d love to look into wealth distributions of each place. Hypothesis: there’s more of a bimodal distribution of wealth in the other countries, so people either take option A for poor people or B which is cars for rich, whereas in Beijing there’s more of a spectrum.
Walking in Beijing
Pretty miserable pedestrian experience. Not captured in the pictures, but there as generally quite a bit of noise too.
Stylish bus stopsFoot bridges look like they’re pedestrian friendly, but they actually indicate that you can’t walk across the street another way. They imply and enforce that walking be totally segregated from the street.
Massive intersectionWalking down this street made me feel like I was about to fall off the edge of a cliff.This exact playground equipment was all over the place. #economiesofscale
Beijing on two wheels
Great infrastructure for mopeds and cyclists though. Look at those separated bikeways!!


Clever solution to chilly mornings in Beijing
Beijing underground
I was really impressed by the Beijing metro. Its wayfinding was especially notable—I didn’t get lost once, despite not speaking a lick of Mandarin!I like how the Chinese have to label their maps with the year, because they actually go out of date rather often due to expansions and improvements.Hutongs
The hutongs were surprisingly walkable. The rest of the city not so much. The highlight of the day was definitely wandering these older neighborhoods and peeking into the traditional, street level, family-owned shops and homes.

Food
I was surprised and disappointed to find I didn’t really like much of the food. (And I’m generally not a picky eater, I promise! In fact, some friends in college called me the Human Trashcan, and I bore that title proudly.)Traditional Chinese breakfast of congee (rice porridge) and steamed buns. I didn’t particularly like it, but it was worth trying.I ordered the Bovine Bone Marrow tea. I can see why someone might like it, but the texture was super odd.


I was really looking forward to this stew (what’s better than braised meat?!), but the flavors were just so odd. Again, happy to have tried it, but not quite my thing.
This crab soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao) was good! It was one of the best things I ate in Beijing.
This candy was a little too sweet for my taste

I had really good food at a beautiful, high-end vegetarian restaurant called Kings Joy. Thanks to Flora for the recommendation! It was a very peaceful place to relax, eat, and read for an hour to recuperate after hours of walking around the hustle and bustle of the city. It was also interesting to peek into the life of wealthier Beijingers. The place was filled with well-groomed ladies with fancy handbags when I was there from 1pm-3pm.
Intense stationery shopCute tapeDoorsills
All of the traditional doorways had a board on the bottom that you had to step over. Even some of the newer buildings had these high doorsills. I wondered why this is and found some obvious answers regarding practicality (keeping out rainwater, small animals, etc) and some not-so-obvious answers:
Ancient people were mostly in loose clothes. So when they strides the doorsill, they had to hold their legs high, and the hidden weapon (if there was one) would be seen.
The linked post also says:
The cultural meanings of doorsill also plays an important part. Firstly, it's a symbol of boundary, making a distinction between your own home and the outside world. Secondly, it represented the owner's class and status; the higher status you were in, the higher doorsill it was. Thirdly, the doorsill symbolized a wall, maybe it's a bit difficult for professor Kuzmich to understand, while, you can comprehend it as western "magic," though, I prefer to regard it as a wish or will. Whatever, at the time, it really meant keeping off the dirt and ghost, hoping to keep the whole family safe and healthy. Fourthly, it's said that when people died, his soul might jump out of his house to be a ghost. In case of that, people built the high doorsill, to keep the soul in, for the soul couldn't jump so high.
These explanations are interesting, but it’s still not clear to me why this would be so common in Chinese architecture and not other traditions. Many of the explanations (especially the functional ones) seem like they would apply anywhere in the world, not just China. Any ideas why the practice would have developed here and not elsewhere? (Or has it developed elsewhere, and I just don’t know it?)

Design
To my admittedly inexperienced eye, Chinese design and architecture (both traditional and new) bear similarities with that of Japan, but I didn’t find it nearly as pleasant. The proportions felt funky to me, and it had a much harsher aesthetic. It’s beautiful in its own way, and I like that it’s distinctive, but it’s just not my favorite.

As I mentioned in my recent post, I'm starting a podcast with my friends, Marie-Agnes and Alain Bertaud, who also happen to be the most interesting couple I know.

Over the course of this first conversation, we traveled all around the globe for a whirlwind tour of the adventurous life they've led together. Here are just a few spots that were on our itinerary:
We started in Tunisia to hear about Marie-Agnes' childhood, then hopped over to neighboring Algeria, where Marie-Agnes and Alain first met. This is also when Alain was first drafted to work as an urban planner in the midst of Algeria's independence from France.Then, we made our way to the US, visiting NYC to hear about how Alain and Marie-Agnes started a family when they were penniless but optimistic immigrants to America.Our next stop was Yemen, where Alain and Marie-Agnes worked for three years as urban planners and befriended Yemeni artisans, tribespeople, and farmers.Then we picked up speed, zipping around the globe to learn about their experiences working in Bangkok, Port-au-Prince, San Salvador, and beyond and how their identity as foreigners played a role in what they were able to achieve.The conversation then moved on to the topic of "city deflation", and how declining populations are a new challenge for cities this century. We made stops in France and Japan, and we visited cities in Russia that lost so much population after the Soviet Union fell that they were formally closed. Then we went to Detroit, where we discussed why the water was turned off and how it's a more nuanced story than is normally told when looked at through the lens of "city deflation".
It was a fabulous conversation, and we're so excited to get to share it with you. Let us know what you think!

Alain (00:00:00)There are certain things in every city which will surprise you. Why do you have a barbershop at this corner and why would you have no department store in this city? So you ask this question and you try to understand why it is like that. [music 00:00:24]

Devon (00:00:24)Welcome to the Order Without Design podcast. I'm Devon, and my co-hosts are the most interesting couple I know: Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud. Alain is an urban planner and economist and Marie-Agnes is a pioneer in mapping and geospatial methods. This project is an extension of their book, Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities.

With its focus on economic theory, you might not realize that this fantastic book is the product of the adventurous life these two have shared together. They have the most incredible stories from living their nomadic lifestyle. This podcast series is my excuse to hear and share those stories.

This first episode is an introduction to the Bertauds. Later episodes will focus on a particular dimension of their life, such as work, education, mobility or parenting and how those facets of their life have been shaped by the cities they've called home.

The three of us don't really have a grand vision for what this podcast will become. Much like the adventures they've had together, we're not really sure where we'll end up, but I can guarantee it'll be interesting if the Bertauds are involved. We had fun putting together this first episode and we can't wait to hear what you think. You can find a link to the transcript and photos in the description.
So with that let's get started. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thank you for agreeing to do this with me. I'm super excited about this project. Today we're going to focus on your shared work as urbanists and how that's shaped your life and perspective.

So the first question is what was the path that brought you to the adventurous nomadic life that you two have led? I know Marie-Agnes you were born in Tunisia, so perhaps that's a good place to start.

Marie-Agnes (00:02:04) Yes, I was born up out of the financial hole if you can say, because early in my life, I live in Tunisia with French parents in the time where Tunisia was still under the protectorate or the French government and when the Tunisia get kind of independence my father was sent to Algeria at the war started almost as soon as we were there.

Devon (00:02:40) I know you mentioned that you met Alain when you were in Algeria. How did you guys meet and what were you doing at the time?

Marie-Agnes (00:02:48) I was a teacher, and Alain was a kind of Peace Corps volunteer and instead of doing military service. He was sent to Algeria to become an urban planner and he was in charge of a small city in new West of Algeria called Clemson. When before I met Alain I was teaching in Tunisia also and when I saw the Tunisian getting, having problem with the French government, we know that one one day we'll be leaving the country. So we went as with my parents, I went to Algeria and when Algeria started to also rebel against the French, my sister and I both were teacher and we were planning to go to a special kind of teaching abode and we were almost ready to go to Africa where still the French government have a running school in Mauritania, in the Senegal. So we were almost ready to move.

Marie-Agnes (00:04:08) And then I met Alain and that changed my life. At the time I met her Alain, Alain teach me about dwellings and he was an architect or headed to be an architect and I started to be interested in architecture and I move in the same direction and Alain, going during a certain month drawing houses in Algeria and from there I take the opportunity to learn more about mapping and about GIS, geographic information system, to do all the work I've done for Alain book, analyzing land use, analyzing land density in cities and making data available for Alain to process and do this book.

Devon (00:05:07) Wow, what an incredible experience. So Alain, Marie-Agnes said that you really changed her life when she ended up meeting you in Algeria and I know you are originally from Marseille in France. So can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up in Algeria and what your path was through school and what you were envisioning the work you would be doing in your career when you were young?

Alain (00:05:32) Very early I wanted to be an architect, probably at the age of 12 or 13 or something like that. And my father would, had a business, engineering business and he would have wished me to be an engineer, but he realized very quickly that I was very independent and things like that and I must say he didn't contradict my advocation if I get good at that. So I am very grateful for that because at the time, this is a long time ago, it was in the fifties. It was normal for parents to impose a profession on their, especially on their son. So I'm very grateful for my parents to be very liberal on that. So after that I finished my degree in Marseilles and then I moved to [Grenoble 00:06:26] to study architecture, but at the time there was only one school of architecture in France.

Alain (00:06:32) It was in Paris and the decentralization system, the French way was that you could study in any town you wanted, but every month and a half you had to go to Paris to pass your exam because there was only one school and there was one entrance exam for entire France, which was in Paris. So it was a strange situation. I went to Grenoble because at the time I was doing competition skiing. I was a downhill icer and so for me when you are 19, 20 sports is very important for a boy. And so I thought so I will study architecture in Grenoble and then with my colleagues every month and a half we will go to Paris and spend a week in Paris passing our exams. Then we'll go back to Grenoble. Eventually after two or three years, maybe when you get smarter as a boy, you lose interest in competition.

Alain (00:07:28) You realize that it takes too much of your time. So then I moved to Paris to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and then that's where I reached 25 and that's a time there was a draft in France. So you could postpone your, you could have a deferment when you were a student, but at a certain point when you were 25 usually you had to do your military service. So I was drafted in the army. I did six months of bootcamps and things like that, but I had applied also it was a new program. Algeria had been just recently independent two years before and the French were eager to maintain good relation with Algeria in spite of the very bitter and nasty fight to place for independence and so they started the equivalent of the Peace Corps.

Alain (00:08:23) But for people will be in, instead of finishing their military service in a barrack in France, the one who I had degree in could go to usually Algeria at the time. It was only Algeria to be the equivalent of a Peace Corps. So after six months, certainly I receive my new papers saying that I will be an urban planner in Oean first, the city of Oran. So I went there, spent a few months there to familiarize myself with a job with Algeria, supervised by older Frenchmen who were still there after independence. They're this special kind of a assistant thing and then after that, then I was nominated to be on my own as an urban planner in the city of Clemson, but I met Marie-Agnes in Oran and it's also changed my life because at the time I was interested in many, many things and maybe I was not clearly focusing on a career or I was very much interested in archeology, in artistry, in mathematics also at the same time and I liked very much to challenge my professors, which is not a good way of getting very grade sometime.

Alain (00:09:56) And then when I met Marie-Agnes suddenly I realized that I have to concentrate on something and that something was in fact urban planning because although my training... At the time by the way at the École des Beaux-Arts they didn't make any difference between urban planning and architecture. For them a city was just a big building, which is of course a terrible mistake. A city is absolutely not a big building. So that means that it should be planning all details in advance and then after that you implement your plan. But my stay, I was always interested in cities because when before going to Algeria before when I was still a student, I will spend most of my summer very often in the Middle East, first in Europe and then in the middle East, looking at because of my interest in art history, looking at ruins usually and the Middle East is full of them, layers of civilization. So I will spend my summer there and because I was traveling in very, let's say I was not going to stand out hotels or similar to that. The type of hotel I would go to where hotels where you are 10 people per room and you don't know your roommates. That's the type of hotels in the Middle East I was staying in. So I get an interest, I was always living in the poor, the poorest quarter of say Istanbul or Ankara or Tehran or Shiraz or Isfahan and so I was interested in the city themselves because I realized that this poor neighborhood that they had a life of their own, which was very different from what I knew and that people knew how to organize themselves with very, very little resources.

Alain (00:11:54) So that was I developed an interest in urban planning at that time or the year I spent in Algeria on the job, in the frontline, not studying, not reading books, not reading article, not making project for the bazaar, but a real problem. Like I explained in the book, receiving building permits every morning, having to take a decision whether to give the permit or not. These were really frontline decision and I found that very interesting. And that's Marie-Agnes is a very practical woman as you have guessed. She encouraged me in this direction. So that decided a bit my career.

Devon (00:12:39) Your practical bottom of approach to understanding cities is really what stood out to me about your book. So it's cool to hear about sort of the turning point when that happened. When you mentioned that the École des Beaux-Arts had this approach that for them a city was just a big building where there's just more details to get right, but at the end of the day you can sort of design the whole thing and you ended up having a very different experience on the ground when you actually were working on real problems in Algeria. What were some of the things that you needed to learn and how did you change your mind over that process?

Alain (00:13:13) Well, the approach of the École des Beaux-Arts is that an architect or a planner is a genius. So everything is in his head and he has to impose his ideas on others. This is the essence of it that in a way the public is uneducated and this job is to educate them and impose these ideas. By living in those cities, by being confronted very early and by the way, before going to Algeria, I have spent nine months in India and working in Chandigarh in the city built by Corbusier after India independence. So that was three years before I did my military service and here I learn also the difference between the theory about a city that you read in books or in papers and what it is to live in a city, go to work every morning, meet your friends and things like that.

"Cities have a physiology which is just like human beings. We have different culture, we have different history, we have a different environment." — Alain
Alain (00:14:13) And then I sought, here I realized that there was a very, very big difference and if you want to be useful in a city, the first thing is to look around and look what people are doing and try to understand why they do it that way and then you can later say, "Well maybe there's a better way of doing it," but first you have to understand why they do it that way and very often you find that they have a very good reason of doing things that way, including by the way things like informal settlement or something like that and former settlement or it's a very clever response of very poor people to situation. It is not something which necessarily have to be eradicated or something like that. So that's what I learned really that way. That's very, very different.

Alain (00:15:05) And so the big difference also that an architect but especially an urban planner is certainly not a genius and should not be a genius. It should be more like a family doctor, somebody who will really look it very carefully about these patient. Cities have a lot of things in common, whether it's a city in a poor country or in a rich country, they have a physiology which is the same really like human being. We have the same physiology. However, like human beings, we have different culture, we have different history, we have a different environment which shaped us.

Alain (00:15:42) And so we have to take into account that. So let's say if I have to use a metaphor for an urban planner, the closest one would be a family doctor. Somebody would try to learn about his patient, their history, what is special to this patient, but at the same time relies on knowledge about the physiology, which is the same for every human being and the same for every city. The city has a physiology where, that's where urban economics comes in. The physiology in fact is explained by urban economics and so you have to go back and forth between the theory and the detail.

Devon (00:16:26) Yeah, definitely. And that firsthand experience gives you lots of stories and anecdotes to really understand with intuition what's going on, but then you can draw those out into broader lessons that you can then bring in apply. And one thing I love about the life that you and Marie-Agnes have lived together is that you've both lived together, is that you've lived in so many different places and experienced them both as residents as well as planners and urbanists. Was that something that you intended to do with your life or did it just sort of end up being that way and in the end you pulled all the threads together?

Alain (00:17:02) Well we certainly, both Marie-Agnes and I, we love traveling and we are absolutely not afraid of a new environment and new, we are not attached to land. For Marie-Agnes, yes it's because she always lived in a foreign country in fact. She knew she was French in a foreign country, so one day she would have to leave. So I think it was natural to her. For me, my father liked traveling a lot. He traveled a lot and kept traveling to his death practically around the world. And so I learned these things about traveling, being an important and observing, looking around was something which was important. So we definitely wanted to travel. It was a bit a romantic thing. It was a bit the romanticism of the explorer of the 19th century, that discovering. I remember reading about René Caillié, the first European went to Timbuktu. For me this was really the wonderful thing.

Alain (00:18:11) Of course it was a little too late in the century to discover Timbuktu, but it was the next best thing in a way to become. So when I graduated, we were trying to apply for a job as urban planner in a foreign country. Probably the, the easiest way would have been a former French colony. We were looking at Cambodia or Vietnam or area like that and then we had a friend was just coming from an American college. She had been in Oberlin College in Ohio and she was French and she had spent one year there and she said, "The United States is so different. It's so incredible and you should at least spend a year there before you go to Cambodia or Africa, whatever." And she somehow convinced us. It was a time, so that was 1967, it was a time, she came back with a record of Bob Dylan and thing like that which was complicated for sure for us.

Alain (00:19:18) And so we decided to do that for one year, go to the US for one year just to get an experience. And then we, in a way the US became our base. We traveled a lot after that, but became our base. I mean it was certainly decision to travel, but to spend a lot or at least a number of years traveling. But there was no real plan and so we arrive in the US at this job, found a job with Philip Johnson, the architect in New York and Marie-Agnes had to learn English there and she learned about few months and she was able to have a job with the city planning commission after that. That's drafting thing and things like that and doing surveys.

Alain (00:20:12) So we integrated. We loved the New York very much, but then there was this, we saw an advertisement for Yemen. I told Marie-Agnes one evening, "Hey, there's this job for an urban planner in Yemen." She immediately say, "Yes, this is wonderful. Let's go." And by that time we had two young children. So that's rather unique because many of my friends or relative sometime the spouse, the man have a drop somewhere because of his career. He has to move from Paris to Leon, Marseilles or whatever. And usually the wife says, "No, no, no. We have a house here. We have our friend. We cannot move." Now Marine-Agnes is opposite. She was absolutely delighted. She had no problem with that. So again, that was not, and then from there so we went from, we spent two and a half years in New York and then for Yemen we had the contract of two years and then we renew it for one year.

Alain (00:21:22) So we spent three years in Yemen and that was under the UN. But again, it was not planned and after we loved Yemen and we loved the job there. The only problem we realize is that we had no cure there. I was the only urban planner, architect in the entire country and the people who like me praised my work, but usually I had a lot of support. Everybody with the government and everybody, I was, we were very popular in a way because we... But we had no feedback professionally. We thought that at the end we will become kind of a notability in Yemen, but maybe we were not doing the right thing because we were just alone. Nobody criticize us for what we're doing. So we decided to... at the time though there was a World Bank project in Yemen the last year, the last year we were there.

Alain (00:22:22) And among all the foreigners coming to Yemen after the end of the civil war, the World Bank was only one I was impressed with. I think the other many of these visitors were a bit amateurs and the World Bank seems to have an approach which was leading to projects, didn't get to lending, to specific project, not just something fuzzy and they had money too, of course to finance those projects. So I thought that was interesting. So after we left Yemen, I went to Washington and I had an interview with the World Bank with my background again Chandigarh, India, Algeria, Yemen and New York, it was a good resume. So they offered me a job because at the time they had just started an urban department, up to that date.

Alain (00:23:24) That was in '74 they had mostly financed big infrastructure like highways, railways, ports, and McNamara decided that cities were important and that a bank should have a special department just for cities. So I was very lucky again here, very lucky to arrive at this moment. So they offered me a job, but at the same time I had an interview with a small consulting firm who happened to have a job doing the master plan of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. And again talking with Marie-Agnes she was very enthusiastic about going to Haiti because compared to Yemen, this will be a complete cultural difference, that nothing in common with the two countries certainly.

Alain (00:24:13) And so we decided to accept the job in Haiti. So I called the World Bank and say, "I'm sorry, I'm not taking the job. I'm going to Haiti instead," and they were absolutely furious. They could not understand how you could refuse it, a job at the World Bank for doing the master plan of Port-au- Prince. So I told them, "Well after two years in Haiti I will have more experience in the field a very different country, a different culture. I will be more useful to the World Bank if you are still interested," and the guy on the phone bang the phone and say "After two years in Haiti you will be useless," and then he hang up the phone.

Devon (00:24:51) So you both have spent a lot of time in a lot of new cities and done some really good work in shaping master plans and various rules and regulations. What's your process for understanding a new city? So let's say I drop you in Dar es-Salaam Tanzania, which I understand is a place you've never been before and I just give you six days to get to know the city and ask you to give me recommendations to improve the way it's run.

Marie-Agnes (00:25:16) First thing, when I know where I'm going especially now with the technology, the Google has satellite imagery. I go on the internet and I adjust it before and I just check Dar es-Salaam Tanzania and I get the city of Dar es-Salaam and then navigate in the city and I can realize already a number of things will be very interesting to investigate when before going and I use satellite imagery Googlers in many, many of the new project we are having now and we do that on my computer and I use-

Marie-Agnes (00:26:03) And we do that on my computer, and I use a satellite imagery and all the tools that go with Google Pro, Google Earth Pro, and started to measure and look at the different type of construction, different type of development, where the cities is located. Dar es Salaam is a port, and is in Tanzania, and I check the facility along the port, I check the airport, I will check all the different type of land use, industries, residential. And you can check on the... Dar es Salaam, for example, you have formal and informal development. And just by looking at those images you can already see that there is a huge proportion of the population live in slum, not a slum, but informal development. May not be necessarily terrible, but you can see the shape of the plot, the type of houses, and you can also, on the internet, check for the population of the cities, where are the possibility of, what will be the next population in 20 years or 30 years from now?

"In many of the places we have lived, there was no existing map." — Marie-Agnes
Marie-Agnes (00:27:36) The projection, for example, Dar es Salaam now is four million point three and they projected for 2015, 20 million. So the city will grow as much in less than 50 years in 40 years, and you need to have more development. And I can already check in the satellite imagery where the development will happen. And you can see already on the edge of the city a number of new developments starting land where have been clear. And so you can already before going, do your own work and do an evaluation of what is the city now and what you expect when you arrive there? So in six days I can already before leaving, register a number of sites where I can go when I should go to take some more information concerning the condition of the houses, the condition of the people live in this place. Have they access to water? Have they access to school? Have they access to other facilities? So it's a huge... We are in this, years now, compare it to what, my first study in Karachi was done about the same way as I just described now, is because of the access, before you go, having access to information that it cost nothing compared to the \$10,000 the World Bank pay for the satellite imagery. Here you have any place on Earth in Google Earth Pro. All the information you can get before you step in a place.

Speaker 2 (00:29:41) Yeah. That bird's eye view is so important. I've recently started using this app called Zenly, which it's sort of like Find My Friends, but sort of in the Snapchat age if you want to think of it in those terms. And what it does is it tracks your location around the city and you can see how much of the city you've actually explored. And it's been very surprising for me. I live in San Francisco and I thought I knew this city really well, but according to Zenly, I have only seen 13% of the city because what I do is I go to all the same neighborhoods. My friends tend to live in certain neighborhoods, not in other neighborhoods, and so I've started trying to, now that I have that perspective on the map, I've been trying to explore other parts of the city that I don't go to as much. And so I love your approach here of the bird's eye view of the satellite imagery so that you get more of a holistic sense of what the city looks like as opposed to just getting to know the places that you happen to be on that visit, or the places with restaurants that looked nice to go to or where your hotel or home, where you're staying is.
Speaker 3 (00:30:49) Yeah.

Marie-Agnes (00:30:49) Exactly. And the very good thing I do also like you do when we have to visit a friend and we don't know the place. Okay. You go to Google Map, but also you have with Google Map the satellite data. And if you zoom in the place at the location you're going, you know before in advance where the people live is a house, is an apartment, is it next to a subway? If you don't drive, what are the means of transportation you can get, you can have, to go to this place? So, so much information now is available compared to when we started say, how many years now? 15 years ago where we were working on cities and before you were related only of books or maps, existing map, but many of the place we have been, you know in a developing world, there were no map, no existing map, and I remember when we arrive in Sanaa, Yemen, Alain has no map and maybe he can tell you the story but he took his Land Rover and goes to the next mountain next to Sanaa.

Marie-Agnes (00:32:14) There's a huge mountain and he go up to there and took out his camera and took photo of the city. But we have located now all the planners and when we teach at NYU now, and people start to look at the data we have gathered and I said, "Look, you are lucky you are living in a data driving society and you should use the data." In the US, you have access to all the data compared to when we are in India or someplace, and we can derive a lot of information with a satellite, with existing data, managing information as I do with the satellite imagery and map. We match information for population, land value, location of school, network for public transport, access to the public transport according to the network of transport.

Marie-Agnes (00:33:28) And so you can match population who can have access to a metro station. For example, calculate around the metro station, say a kilometer around this metro station, how many population can be having access to the station in less than 10 minutes walk? Before to do a study like we are doing now with the computer, it will take six months. And now with the technology we have on hand, with your graphic information system, satellite imagery, existing map, merging data, it can done in one month.

Speaker 2 (00:34:12) I imagine this doesn't just change the quantity but also the quality of the work that you do.

Marie-Agnes (00:34:18) Absolutely. Before we were, like in Karachi at first, in order to have access to those aerial photo, I have to prove that I was having already this formation in hand. I came with a big print of the satellite imagery that I carry with me and when they see what I was having as already information, they let me dig in their door.

Marie-Agnes (00:34:50) If not, I will have asked three or four officers and then be accompanied to security guard just to open the door of the aerial photo of the city.

Speaker 2 (00:35:06) Why were they so protective of that data?

Marie-Agnes (00:35:08) At that time and still now, they have a potential of war between India and Pakistan. And they thought if we have access to those aerial photo, someone, a spy like me, they thought maybe I may be a spy that can take picture or copy of the photo and target and if the coordinate of these place and if someone targeted this place with bombs or anything.

Speaker 2 (00:35:38) I see. So given aerial photography or looking at Google Maps and once you've sort of done your homework before going into a place, how do you decide which sites you want to go to and how do you get around the city?

Marie-Agnes (00:35:50) In the Google Earth now, I will check the coordinate of different type of development, land use development, housing development, and infrastructure, location of schools, and all these services. And after that, I will maybe survey, go to the site and survey maybe 20 place in less than six days. You can do that, no problem. You just order a taxi or an interpreter if you don't speak the language. That was the case in Karachi, few people speak English. So with an interpreter, a driver, and myself, we visit in less than three days, 20 site. Took measurement, question the situation of the people for what to supply, problem, et cetera.

Speaker 2 (00:36:52) So Alain?

Alain (00:36:53) Yes.

Speaker 2 (00:36:54) What's your process for understanding a new city? Say I drop you in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and give you six days to get to know the city, and then I ask you to give me recommendations for how to improve the way it's run. Where would you start?

Alain (00:37:07) Well, do you drop me within an institution or do you drop me just like a tourist, like saying, so that's quite different actually. So you see if you arrive but you have already contacted an institution, usually you have a contract with a municipality or something, with your company or... So, the first thing is a contact with this institution. But on the other hand, you could work in a situation where you don't know anybody and you are just asked by some other institution, maybe international, give me a quick assessment of what the city is like. You know, what is its potential or something. So, that's two different things. You know the approach will be a little different in either situation.

Alain (00:38:02) So, if I am dropped there and say well, let's say you are an international institution and say what is Dar es Salaam like? And of course, normally you would have read something about it, but if you are not, the first thing is to go look of course now at the satellite imagery, as Marie-Agnes has said. But for me, really, a lot of it is just to walk through the streets. On the satellite, you will select some neighborhoods you absolutely want to visit. And if you can have a local contact, it could be a taxi driver, it could be somebody you meet in the street, or in a cafe, start asking question. But the most important thing is to just look. Look what happened. And if you are experienced in looking at cities, there are certain things in every city which will surprise you. You know why do you have a barbershop at this corner? And this is unusual. Why would you have no department store in this city? There are cities, for instance, which have no Central Business District (CBD). So you ask this question and you try to understand why it is like that.

Alain (00:39:29) Also, what is important is to observe, there's a wide area of incomes within a city and you should have a complete sample of what Marie-Agnes has called the topology, the type of housing where these different people of different income live. Many people will visit the city, usually stay in the most comfortable area. You have to go everywhere. And so again, before the satellite imagery, when you have just a plan or a tourist plan, you had to discover those neighborhoods a bit randomly by walking around. I had a methodology before, was to start from the center and then walk, say east, or west, or south, for two or three hours until I reached the outskirt of the city. To have a complete cross-section of the city, at least in several axes, in order to see how it is.

Alain (00:40:39) And then you stumble there on, obviously, maybe randomly, but on very low income neighborhood, middle income, high income, and you observe how much land they consume, how tall are the building? If they are well-built, if they are not well-built and things like that. When you are experienced enough by having seen many cities, you could even, by looking at the neighborhood, roughly assess to the density, the number of people per hectare and usually you are not wrong, maybe you are wrong by 10% but not much more.

Speaker 2 (00:41:19) As you walk around, do you have a particular rubric or particular categories that you are trying to keep an eye on and sort of fill out a list? Or is it just whatever catches your eye, you'll note it down and then think about it later?

Alain (00:41:31) Yes, whatever catch my eye. But say, the way people use land, if you have a lot of commerce in the street. On the country, there are cities which are completely shuttered in, you see very few shops, or the shops are all concentrated in one street and the rest are entirely residential, for instance. So those things are very important to observe because they usually, sometimes people are obliged to do something in a certain way because, for regulation or poverty, but most of the time it's a choice they are making. They are making a trade off. And you have to understand this trade off and you have to be completely, in a way, do not judge it by the standard of your own culture. If you judge by comparing cities to another as one being... Say, if you live in New York and say, well New York is really a wonderful city and you go to Dar es Salaam, you will always say, well, there's no grid, the buildings are too low or things like that.

Alain (00:42:49) So you have to completely abstract to judge it, to say, well this is the way people do things. Now, there are certain things that you realize are, for instance, if you see an open sewer in the middle of the street, you know that this is not because people like it that way. It's because they are too poor to pay for a sewer. Or maybe because the municipality is so incompetent that they are completely unable to put a sewer there. So you don't take that as it's a cultural thing that they enjoy the sewer, but there are certain things that are cultural and you have to respect that, and not infer your own culture on it.

Speaker 2 (00:43:31) What do most people who develop cities, including urban planners, urban economists, mayors, other local representatives, what do they not pay enough attention to? And what do you think that they pay too much attention to?

Alain (00:43:43) They don't pay enough attention to mobility first. You know the way people move around the city. Many planners, or even mayors, consider that mobility is a bad thing. That if you could work and live in the same place, it will be wonderful, which is not mobility. Mobility means that you can move around the city and maybe work at civil jobs or something that and change up. So they consider that, very often, mobility is the enemy, where in fact mobility is a friend of the city. And the other thing is affordability. It's important that there's enough supply of land so that everybody, whatever his income, can afford a house. And it's a necessity in a city. I mean it's a reality that you have a wide array of income within the city.

Alain (00:44:48) In my book I describe civil income distribution curve. You should not divide the population into low income, middle income, and high income. You should have a complete income distribution curve. Some planners have a tendency when they work in developing country to feel also that poverty is a necessity, not a necessity, but it's fate, and that the city should be designed entirely for the poor. Implying that development, economic development, is not important, that you have just to get it to the poor. Others have just the opposite saying, "Well everybody should be rich and even people who are too poor maybe should not live in a city." So you see you have those two extremes. For politician, they are very reluctant usually to admit that a lot of people in their city are poor and that it will take time for them to become non poor, to reach a middle class.

Alain (00:45:56) And so they tend to hide it, or to even wish that those people will go away by making life difficult for them. So, that's even the worst thing they can do. Because for me, the job of a city, especially a city in a country which is developing, which is urbanizing, it's a machine for taking people with low skill from rural area, where they have skill in a rural area, but their skills are usually not very useful in the city. So take those people with low skills, and within maybe half a generation, if you are successful, or one generation, transform them to citizens who have an urban job, who are very productive in the city. And the faster you integrate those people in the city life, the more successful is a city. And the success of the city should be measured by that, how fast you integrate this.

Alain (00:46:56) For instance a city like Hong Kong, or even Singapore, but Singapore is a very special story. But Hong Kong, I knew on Hong Kong, I visited Hong Kong in what 1977? I think '76. The first time and they were still have slums in Hong Kong, really bad slums. And the city managed, because they were a lot of refugees coming from China, people were escaping from Mao China, and arriving in Hong Kong with just a shirt on their back. And the city of Hong Kong was able, within half a generation, to integrate these people in city life, in an urban life. And that's again for me, that's the success of the city. That's integration here.

Alain (00:47:45) Now, these are cities which are growing. In this century now, we are going to see a lot of cities which are not growing, or even shrinking. The cities of Europe are going to shrink, unless they take care of immigrant. And it's possible that if you stop the flow of immigration in the US, you will have also shrinking cities. So, that's a very different problem. But you will still have a lot of cities growing extremely fast like in Africa and Asia, so you will have this duality where in all my career, I was always dealing with cities which were growing fast, either growing fast because you had migration from the countryside, like India or China or Indonesia, or because incomes were going up. And so the city, that was the case in Paris for instance the '50s '60s, income was going up very fast, household size were going down. So that means that the city has also to develop and change very fast to accommodate those changes. So but now we will see cities which are, I have visited such cities in Japan. Cities which are very affluent too, which are very nicely designed, very nicely managed. But their main problem is losing population. And this is something, it's a bit like, in monitoring a field, you know to deal with inflation. Nobody knows how to deal with deflation. And it will be a bit the same thing for a city. I could see the struggle of those mayor who have shrinking cities, very competent mayors, very competent with disparity, running the system extremely well. And I had no idea to solve these problems. You know, once, when I was in Russia, that was about 10 years ago, and I was doing a study on, they asked me to do a study on the new master plan of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. And then they asked me, "Could you help us? We are going to close 60 cities in Russia and could you help us to do that?" And I told them, "I have no idea what to do."

Alain (00:50:13) I mean it's an interesting problem. We are ready to look at it, but I have no experience at all. My experience is just opposite, closing cities, I don't know. And they had to close cities because of demography, and cities which were badly located at the time of communism. So they were a city of 200,000 people. We had to just close them and bring people back to two cities which had the economic potential. So I don't think we will close cities in Western Europe, but I think that they will be very, very serious demographic problem unless we consider that immigration is not just being nice with people, or something like that. But immigration is in fact an economic necessity.

Speaker 2 (00:51:06) In cases like Europe and Japan where cities are depopulating but not necessarily going so far as closing, what happens to the city when it loses population? Why is that bad?

Alain (00:51:18) Well, first, when it loses population, it means usually that it's aging. You know that you have a lot of old... The active population become a smaller part of the total population. Those cities usually are affluent, and therefore they have a welfare system. There is a lot of transfer between active people to inactive people. And when the inactive people become more numerous and the active people, it's a burden. It's a tax burden on the active one, which is unbearable. That's why they moved to larger, usually larger cities where they... That's a case of Tokyo first. Tokyo is still growing, it-

Alain (00:52:03) That's the case of Tokyo, first. Tokyo is still growing at 1% or 2% a year, but it's growing not because of natural demography, it's growing because it's taking the young people from smaller city which are losing population.

Alain (00:52:17) The problem with that, for instance, in Toyama, one of the city where we spent quite some time, we spent about a week there, two, three years ago, the problem was that there were entire area where the houses were abandoned. If you have a shrinking population, you have houses, and there's nobody to buy those houses, so they stay empty. So you have, in a way, the same problem that they had in Detroit at the same time, when they lost population, too. That those houses are deteriorating. You have to bulldoze them.

Alain (00:52:57) The municipality in Toyama was trying to consolidate whatever people were left in those neighborhoods, to try to move them back to the center of the city, because it's very difficult to run services in a neighborhood where half of the houses are empty. Your sewer system and all that doesn't work very well anymore. Your schools, you still need some schools, but the schools have only two or three students per class, so you have to consolidate them. It's a very, very big problem.

Devon (00:53:31) If I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that leaving the houses abandoned is not just a problem of now the houses deteriorate, but also the services don't scale as well across the rest of the community, and so it becomes more expensive for everybody. Is this part of the reason why, in Detroit, people's water ended up being turned off, because it was just too expensive for the city to serve their half-empty neighborhood?

Alain (00:53:56) Yes. I think that's one of the reasons. One of the absurd reasons, too, in Detroit that I found, I don't know if it's still true now. I learn it about last year, is that the city, when a building was abandoned, the city will still charge whoever was legally owning this building the property tax. So anybody who wanted to redevelop this building, it was usually not in good condition, would have to pay all the arrear of property tax. And that made it uneconomical to develop it in a way.

Alain (00:54:40) So I think that, in a way, one of the problems in Detroit I think was really the attitude of the municipality. The municipality should consider property tax as a ... it's a tax on productivity. If the lot has no production, it's not productivity. Well, you have no reason to tax it. I'm a big fan of property tax, by the way. It's not that I think that it should not be. But I think that the city should realize the impact it has when ... a lot of people will be attracted to go to a city where land and housing is extremely cheap. You could buy a house in Detroit, I suppose, at some neighborhoods for probably $ 50, $100. So it's a good bargain. But if you have to pay \$50,000 of arrears in property tax, it's not a good bargain, because you're ... so then you end up continuing the problem.

Alain (00:55:45) Well, that's Detroit problem. But say, Toyama, the city we visited in Japan was losing population. Didn't have this problem. But their problem was, in a way, when they move people from a suburb to the center, the value of the house in the suburb is zero, even if it's in good condition, because there's no taker. So you see, you have a loss of the value of capital assets. When you have a shrinking city, this is the problem you have. Where, normally, a city is thriving because of the value of capital assets, if your capital assets are shrinking, and shrinking not only by losing value but shrinking in terms of size, the size of the city, then it's a huge problem.

Alain (00:56:42) Again, the older utilities, all the infrastructure of the city, which is the major capital expenditure of a city, sewer system, transport, schools, hospital, are based on these certain densities. If this density go much lower than the current, you have a big restructuring problem, and if you have still, let's say, 300 inhabitant in a neighborhood, and you close the school, and you don't maintain the water very well or you cut it, then it become uninhabitable, and those people are not happy, obviously. You have to take care of them. They are just like if they were homeless, although they are in fact middle class people who had a very nice house. But you have to take care of them like if they were homeless.

Devon (00:57:30) In these cities, as they're growing, when Detroit was in its boom town, as Japan's population was growing, they made certain assumptions around how many people would be in a particular place, how much investment to make in the infrastructure. And now you still have to maintain the infrastructure, but the assumptions are now wrong. And so you're in this position where the value added for the cost is not as high, but people are depending on that infrastructure for their life.

Alain (00:57:56) And in a way, if you ... I don't know if you have followed the gilets jaunes, yellow vest riots in France last year, but one of their, let's say, one of their complaints was that in smaller town, or some rural area, the population was shrinking, and therefore the government was canceling a lot of service. Post office will close, school will close, small dispensary hospital will close. If you ... maternity, for instance, before, a woman was delivering a baby will be within 20 minutes, let's say, maximum from an hospital with a maternity, and suddenly became an hour and a half.

Alain (00:58:45) This was, again, because of a shrinking population in a rural area, in small towns. You have to say, "We are going to tax more the people who are more productive in the cities, in order to maintain people in non-productive area, where they cannot be very productive." But we have to maintain a maternity in an area where they will deliver maybe 15 babies a year, which is not financially feasible. Or it's a big luxury, if you do that. So the taxes for the other are increasing, and to maintain people who are in the location which are not very productive.

Alain (00:59:34) Again, I'm thinking aloud here, because I think nobody has tackled this problem really. Probably the Japanese now are starting to look at it that way, and the Korean are next now. And the Chinese are going to be next, in the next 20 years, probably they will have the same problem of Japan's.

Devon (00:59:56) I have sympathy for both sides of this equation, because on one hand, you don't want to cut off maternity service to a family that has built their life around being in a particular place. On the other hand, you want to be able to help as many people in a society as possible, and if you're expending a lot of resources to help one particular household, when potentially you could support 10 at that same price point, it makes sense to try to encourage people to move to the cities.

Devon (01:00:23) Have you seen any efforts by various cities or societies that try to encourage people to move to the cities with some sort of incentive? Or not necessarily to cities, but to places where the infrastructure costs are more reasonable?

Alain (01:00:39) The only place I've seen is Japan. Yeah. The Japanese are doing that. Yes, yes. But to do that, they still need subsidy from the central government. Again, you have this question of, do you maintain services in area which ... the resources of a country are limited. If you maintain those services in those empty area, or nearly empty area, you have to decrease the services in the one which are productive. There's no ... or you increase the taxes enormously. But it means a very large amount of increase in taxes.

Alain (01:01:20) And there are some services when you cannot increase productivity. For instance, I think all the medical service, where you can computerize all lot of things, but it's very labor intensive. A teacher, for instance, you cannot, so far, unless we manage to teach children entirely with computers, but normally, a teacher productivity cannot be increased. But that's not true of some services.

Devon (01:01:53) Yeah. And it'll be interesting to see how different countries and different cities approach these problems. Because in the United States, we have some similar challenges, though not just with depopulation, but also we've spent generations paving roads, building highways, far into the wilderness, that costs a lot of money, to create that much roadway over such a large country, instead of investing in core cities. That's sort of, in my opinion, a bit of a self-imposed problem. But then also, to compound that with the fact that those towns that we've built roads out to maybe depopulating even faster now.

Alain (01:02:32) Right, yeah. But, you see, in the US, you have also the way your political structure is organized, around state, and the density of the state is not taken into account. It's only ... so that will compound the thing, in a way. You have two senators per state, so every state wants the same amount of roads. But that's beyond my ... I must say this is a political organization which is completely beyond my competence, but ...

Devon (01:03:07) And the structure of the politics, and the way that institutions are formed really affects the way that these decisions can be made. I imagine in Japan, because so much is centered around Tokyo, and it's such a central part of all of Japanese society, whereas the US is a much more distributed country, and states have a lot more decision-making power.

Alain (01:03:28) Although Japan has still a number of cities like Osaka who are still very dynamic, but there are only three or four left, yes. Right. Yeah. With trust-

Devon (01:03:39) Right. And many more decisions are made at the national level. I know the zoning laws are basically determined at the national level.

Alain (01:03:47) More stunning, though, by the way ... it's very specific to the US to have this extreme decentralization of zoning law. The, let's say, many country, the mayor takes decision whether an area is residential or industrial, that that's done at a local level. But usually the definition of what is residential, that forces what will be the density, what will be the standards, is usually national or regional. And here in the US, any city can decide, or to calculate floor ratio, any town can decide or to calculate floor ratio, or to calculate the height of a building. If you have maximum heights. In my town, in Glen Rock, the way you calculate the height of a building is different from the next town of Ridgewood, which is just across, you know ... so this extreme decentralization is specific to the US, by the way.

Devon (01:04:47) Yeah. I could list an endless list of disadvantages of that approach. But I'm curious, what do you see as the advantages? What are the plus sides?

Alain (01:04:56) Well, the plus side is, of course, the feeling that the citizen are in charge. But I think that if you have very small boundaries ... there is some literature on that. Some economists say, "Well, all those small town, say 8,000 people, 5,000 people, are just like clubs. So they decide how much tax they want to use, and they decide their infrastructure or their standards according ... the same way as you have club, you have rich man club and you have poor man's club." So if we want to adjust to what ...

Alain (01:05:33) I am not very convinced by that, because, at the end, especially if those cities, these towns, are part of a larger metropolitan area, they tend to be very ... I won't use the word egoistic, but say, in a way, they don't want any large hospital, for instance. They don't want certainly anything to process waste. And because they know they can use it at a metropolitan level, somebody else will have it. They don't want people slightly lower income than they have, so they will adjust their zoning so that nobody with a lower income than them could come, by imposing, again, minimum floor size or things like that, or a floor ratio.

Alain (01:06:26) I'm not sure it's a such a good thing. You know? What is optimum size? I don't know. I think that many decision on land use should be taken at the metropolitan size. Even with a referendum and something ... in a way, the way the Swiss are doing, where a lot of decision in Switzerland are taken at the cantonal level, canton is ... sometime it correspond to a city, but very often it's a group of villages, really. And you vote for everything. But it's relatively large, compared to a town in the US.

Devon (01:07:14) Yeah. Something I find quite frustrating in my own metropolitan region of San Francisco, the Bay Area, is that there's a lot of people who I think think of themselves as standing up for minority rights, for poor people's rights, and things like that, and being very progressive, but actually, they're ... and they certainly are, they generally vote that way on the issues that they realize affect those people. But I think they then will push for things like minimum floor size, or not allowing an apartment to be built in their neighborhood, not having access to ... yeah. Pushing out waste facilities to poorer towns nearby, without really thinking about it in those terms.

Devon (01:07:57) Instead, they think, "Oh, well, of course I don't want my child to have to walk past a sewage facility." No one wants to make their child do that. But by having more political power and time, and pushing those things out, and saying, "We don't want these problems within our neighborhood," it then ends up impacting people, I would argue, actually more than some of the other issues that people may push for.

Devon (01:08:22) Something I've been trying to figure out how to do is how to ... one of the things I'm excited about for this podcast is how you and Marie-Agnes have this great view of human flourishing in general, beyond just the most obvious hot button issues, but also how the shape of the city ends up really impacting people's lives.

Alain (01:08:43) Right. Yes, yes, yes. Certainly, yeah. Those trade off, and in a way, some decision I think will be better taken, I think, at the metropolitan level, just using, in a way, a non-political view, but just a technocratic view. But other decisions are better at the political level. I still, I think, as a planner, we have to recognize that, at the end, it's an elected mayor, who established the priorities. There is no scientific way of establishing priorities. These are political decisions.

Alain (01:09:26) Now, as a technician, you can also of course try to influence a mayor, saying, "Well, you have a really bad housing problem, and we had better deal with it before it become really even more acute," and you can document it and probably convincing. I am a strong believer in convincing people, by the way. I think people have reason, they use reason. They use passion, but they use also reason. And I think that sometimes we neglect a bit this aspect, that if you have a well well-informed argument and you are not pompous about it or pedantic about it, you can convince people what is the right thing to do. And it's easier to convince a metropolitan population to do the right thing than to convince a neighborhood.

Devon (01:10:19) As you've lived in all these different cities and worked in all these different cities, it seems like you've built really strong relationships with many of the locals, both just normal residents, but also people within the government, and with NGOs, and the UN. How did it feel to work with other people in each of these places, and how did the work culture differ?

Marie-Agnes (01:10:41) We, in Yemen, for example, I was the only woman working in the office, and because of being a woman in a country where men and women are separately, I was having some advantage here, because I was a foreign woman. I could go in the two society, the women and the men. And women have different way to see life than men. The men are entertaining themself, and the women stays in between themself.

Marie-Agnes (01:11:17) There are two way to entertaining, to be entertained, but they love to receive. And I was all the time when we were invited to a party or to a gathering, the women have nothing to do with the life outside the house. So I was, when we go inside a house, I will all the time let the men go first, and the men normally goes up to the top floor, where they receive the guests, and the women are living in the first floor, second floor, third floor. So I will be working behind the men, and turning my head, and the women will grab me by the hand and drag me to their kitchen or to their room, and then with my poor Arabic, I was still able to converse with the women, and see the situation they were living in.

Marie-Agnes (01:12:18) For example, in a kitchen, the women are cooking with charcoal and wood, and there were no evacuation for the smoke. So most of the women, after cooking in front of the fire, get conjunctivitis, red eyes, and there was a little problem there. And so we realize that it was an obligation for the future house to have a kind of evacuation for the smoke. And we build in our house, we build a little fireplace with evacuation, and a fireplace with an evacuation, and people will come to visit our house. And they will see that we have a made an improvement in a way we should have the kitchen be having a smoke evacuation for the fumes.

Marie-Agnes (01:13:22) But this is in Yemen. In other place, women participate. I works in Indonesia and the women are having, in Indonesia, a lot to say and they are participating in the work, in the office, and be, again, a woman, it was the same thing as in Yemen. I could talk to the women more about women problem than men can talk, especially in Muslim country, like in Indonesia. They are not all Muslim, but the majority are.

Marie-Agnes (01:14:04) Also, the work with NGO. There were few NGO in Yemen, when we were there, because the country was not yet in the map for many people, and the only NGO were the few NGO was working with the embassies. So there were people were just there for few days, and doing some data gathering, but they have nothing to do with what we were doing, most of the NGO. But in Indonesia the NGO are very active, and when you visit a site in a slum ... not a slum, they call a compound, it's a village who have been integrated to a city, who receive ... where the government give some very infrastructure, like the water, the sewage, garbage collection. And they also monitor the school.

Marie-Agnes (01:15:06) So the compound in Indonesia are very organized, and many work are done by the women there. So we connect with those women, and we get to to work with them, for doing some surveys in the place, or something like this. We have, Alain and I, some kind of loners, some people think, because we are a team, and we work together, and the people let us work together because they know we are very efficient, and we connect with the other group of people. If it's the World Bank, we connect for the other information we need, and we have good relation with all the people in the field, with the local people we have to work with, or with the people that works with the World Bank, or professional who are working with us.

Marie-Agnes (01:16:10) The professional in Yemen, they give me so much lead. One time, I wanted to get Yemeni promote the artisanal production. They were doing a number of beautiful thing, like pots, and embroideries, and they were starting to have some tourists coming to Yemen. And I discussed with the people in the ministry of tourism, and I propose to make a little shop where the tourists can buy things that are interesting for tourism. The little pottery or little fabrics and dresses that the Yemeni do embroider, and they give me free lead, and give me cash money, to do all the things I was supposed to do, without any discussion about how I'll operate or anything.

Marie-Agnes (01:17:28) The Yemeni were very keen on having people doing the work they thought they couldn't immediately figure out. So I did that in less than two months. I built a little art shop next to the post office in Sana'a, and we gather all the things that tourists are interested, and the shop was successful, but the Yemeni are not good for maintenance, and I was not interested in-

Marie-Agnes (01:18:03) ... and I was not interested in doing all the managing of the place and we couldn't find anybody to take care, so fortunately things fall out. But we are very easy... I mean I connect very easy with any people. I speak some Spanish and some Arabic and we managed to speak some Thai, even though Thai is more difficult.

Marie-Agnes (01:18:36) But we all the time have very easy, I mean we have a lot of friends, so much friends in Yemen that we will blush to pretend that we are not there. We will close all the windows. And there was one home where we have a skylight, with the children at night we will retreat in a room without any window in it and we have light, just a low light and we will not respond to the bell because they were coming at any time.

Marie-Agnes (01:19:15) The Yemeni have no hours and they come early morning, they can come at 10 at night and the Yemeni, they are very hospitable. When you visit someone, they all time serves tea or cake or they quickly gives you something to eat. So I was doing the same, I will offer tea and cookies. And so they will stay for hours and hours and we have the children with us, so we wanted the children to go to bed. So we have to do some kind of trick so people will not come at certain hours.

Devon (01:20:01) You were a newcomer to many of the places that you worked. What were the challenges of doing your work as an outsider to those communities and what were the advantages?

Alain (01:20:12) Let's start with the advantages. The advantages was that because I was a foreigner, they consider me to be more even ended in my opinion. That if I, say for instance you have to develop your sewer, they didn't infer that my brother-in-law was a contractor making sure and that's why I was advocating that. So there was a naivety of being a foreigner, which I think is a big advantage. It seems that you are really an honest worker.

Alain (01:20:44) The disadvantage of course is that you may ignore certain things which are important either in the culture or in politics. And sometime you may say things that you don't realize you are entering a minefield or something like that. So you have to be careful about that. For instance say, you may ask question about there was a project to bring water to the slum, but I see that it has never been done. And why is it? What was the problem?

Alain (01:21:24) And suddenly you see everybody kind of freeze because there was a big corruption problem and the Mayor is involved in it and so they cannot say anything without attacking the Mayor or something like that. So if you are aware of it, if you were aware of the local story, then you will ask the question in different way, you see. But so again, being a foreigner that way, sometime you do naive things or certain things you don't quite understand, even if you try to understand. But again, one of the big advantage is to be an honest worker, to have no... In Yemen, it was a very, very clear things.

Alain (01:22:11) One of my job that I decided was the most important job was in fact to establish, to trace new streets in the suburb of Sana'a. And the farmers who were owning the land there, like me to do it because they knew I had no idea what tribe were there, who was owner of this. I will propose something which made sense from the way to link all this piece of land with a network of transporting in Sana'a. But they knew I had absolutely no dog in the fight and they told me so. They liked it for that, there was kind of a naivety who protected me.

Alain (01:22:58) And where they will have assumed that any Yemeni doing that will have in the back of his mind saying, "Well, this is good for my brother-in-law who wants that," or something like that. In this tribal society, there is always a suspicion of corruption. I mean they will not call it corruption by the way, they will call it... It's a way of defending your tribe which is normal. It's a tribal patriotism I will call it. And in a way if you are not suspected of that, it's a big advantage.

Devon (01:23:36) You had the credibility to come in and they assumed that really when you made a suggestion it was what was globally best for the whole community as opposed to someone trying to claim that credibility.

Alain (01:23:46) Well, one thing which I think they appreciated very much is first, they see if you are working hard, a variable. And even if it's hard, you say, "I'm going to trace those streets." You are there with your transits, you trace them, you are there in the full sun and you don't complain. And they appreciate enormously hard work. And then the other thing is to be interested in the country and their culture.

Alain (01:24:19) If you learn something about the local poets, the local writers, if you have read if it's a country which has writers and things like that, then you read a translation, you know the local writer, they appreciate enormously that you make this effort. And it will give you more credit than if you were a local and of course you knew about it.

Devon (01:24:43) I imagine it's very important to show that you respect their culture and their history, so that, as opposed to coming in and saying, "This is the way things have to be done. This is the way we did it where I'm from." But at the same time, not having all of the baggage and the potential for corruption and you don't have necessarily a horse in the race, you can make more fair judgements as well.

Alain (01:25:08) That's right, yes.

Devon (01:25:09) So you've had a really interesting career. That was really showed through your book and one of the reasons I was so excited to meet both you and Marie-Agnes.

Devon (01:25:19) If you wanted to give advice to a young urbanist who wanted to lead a career like yours, though of course not following perfectly in your footsteps but sort of paving their own path, what three cities would you suggest they live in? Imagine they have a year and they're going to live in each city for four months each. What are the three cities that you would send them to?

Alain (01:25:42) Well, it's a difficult question. Because again we did most of our career in Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia and a little Latin America and a little US. But things are different now. The real dynamism is still in Asia I think. And but it's in Africa. And Africa, I must say I avoided it except South Africa. But I avoided it because I thought again there was not much urban tradition and I felt the few contact I had when I was surprised to go there, that the corruption was so high that it was beyond my ability to solve problem there. And so I avoided Africa.

Alain (01:26:34) But I think now, you cannot avoid Africa, you have to move. I think it has done a lot of progress too. Africa, in the seventies or eighties were still in the decolonization period. And by the way, being also a member of a nation which was a colonial power, was I think in Africa was a liability. I told so to my colleague in the World Bank when sometime because I spoke French, they wanted me to go to Africa. And I said they had French there for 50 or 100 years, they would like to see somebody else. And I think it's a little unfair.

Alain (01:27:24) This is a World Bank, it's international. They have so many already french assistance that they get to another French, whatever, exactly the same idea. Because it's true. The French and their colonies, contrary to the British, wanted really to establish a French Republic there. So everything was imitated; the French administrative structure, department prefet, all the administrative. Where the British, there was somebody on top but then they were more using the local structure for instance to collect taxes. They use for instance in India, they use the local structure.

Alain (01:28:13) Whereas the French will create a little France there. You see it even in the cities. If you go to Vietnam, you go to Hanoi, you see the main Plaza of Hanoi is exactly like a little French town, with the post office, the church and city hall on the street side. And then the opera, a little next thing. So that's why I thought that it was not a good idea for me to go in a former French colony in spite of my beginning in Algeria.

Devon (01:28:49) I see. You felt like the advice that you would give would not be very interesting to the city because they would already know.

Alain (01:28:56) Oh yeah, no. Myself, I think I was... Let's say I had traveled enough not to impose the French model. In a way, in Algeria, in my book I explained why I thought for instance using the French law in Algeria was a big mistake and I tried not to do it. But the perception is very important. As I told you, in Yemen this perception that I was a naive, uninformed foreigner was very good when dealing with land.

But if the perception was that... In Yemen, it would have been an agent of Nasser or maybe the British Intelligence Service, they were a friend of the Brits. It will have really put me in jeopardy. Or let's say not dangerous, but it would have been a lack of confidence. Saying, well he is saying that because of this.

Devon (01:29:54) I see. So who you are really matters for your ability to get the job done effectively. It almost doesn't matter how smart you are in some cases.

Alain (01:30:02) Well you see, there was this example when I start working for the City Planning Commission, so that was in '68, '69, in a way it was a time of the Black Panthers. There were riots. And the city wanted to do something in in Harlem, and they asked me to take charge of the project because my French accent will put me... When I worked with the black community there, my French accent was such that they couldn't locate me. They had already put people in boxes.

"When I worked with the black community in Harlem, my French accent was such that they couldn't locate me... Because I was a foreigner, in a way that was an advantage. Again, the naivete—they knew I had no axe to grind." — Alain
Alain (01:30:40) White people in a white liberals, for instance they were in a box. And then they were the white racists were in another box. And in a way here I was really a foreigner and in a way they liked it. I didn't get the type of crap that my white colleague would get when they were trying to deal with the black community there at the time. Because I was a foreigner in a way was an advantage. Again, the naivete, I had no axe to grind in a way. I think being a foreigner sometime is a big advantage, if you work with empathy, if you are not arrogant if you never talk about your own country as a model.

Alain (01:31:29) Even if you think that your country sometime is doing good things in certain area, I think you should never mention it as your country usually. Maybe use a idea but not... And then they say an implication of arrogance. And that's completely destroy the advice you will give that you are imposing, you think you are superior. Arrogance means that you are not looking at their own problem, you are already projecting what you know from outside and say this is what should be done. And so you lose credibility.

Devon (01:32:07) Yeah, that really mirrors my experience in the work that I do with open source software communities, where I am a software developer and I've contributed to some open source projects, but I don't have deep roots in any particular project.

Devon (01:32:21) And so now that I'm building tools for open source developers of all sorts, I think it's been very helpful for people to not see me as, "Oh, she's just from Linux," or "She's just from the JavaScript world." But at the same time, because I don't know specifics from these communities, I go in, I try to understand the nuances of how different groups work as opposed to me saying this is the right way to do it.

Alain (01:32:47) That's right. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly, very similar problem. Yes, yes. Yeah. Impartiality is very important when you give advice. And the appearance of impartiality, even if you are impartial but you have people suspect that maybe you may not be, then it destroy your credibility. And again, this ability to reason and communicate and convince. You have to convince people and so to convince people you have to have credibility.

Devon (01:33:14) Absolutely. Okay. So if you have to pick three, it sounds like you would pick one in Africa, one in Asia. Which specific ones would you pick and what would be the third?

Alain (01:33:25) I will pick a city like Lagos which mesmerized me. Although I've never been there, but I look at it on Google and it's an amazing place. It's a complete mess in a certain way from the outside, but it's still work. And Lagos, in Nigeria. Lagos. Yeah, yeah. In Nigeria. The problem also is government. For instance, a city like Cairo is fantastically interesting, but I will not... The form of government right now, I don't think you can do anything. I had this theory before that if you are a planner, you can always... Planning a city is such a human thing that even the dictator, you could convince a dictator to do the right thing.

Alain (01:34:24) And our experience in Haiti at the time of Duvalier convinced me that I was wrong on that. There is a cutoff. If a regime is so dictatorial and such a bad dictatorship, you have to avoid working there because you will lose your time. You may learn something by the way, by working in a dictatorship, but you will not be able to do anything useful and you may even compromise yourself. So I will put Egypt in this. In Nigeria, there's a lot of corruption I understand, but it's a big mess. So if it's a big mess, I think it's all right in a certain way, you can work. If it's not true, where you have a dictator really control everything. Like I think it's a case now in Egypt. It was not the case in the time of Mubarek. I think you could still do something in the time of Mubarek. But now it's Sisi, I think.

Alain (01:35:32) The way I see it, I will not advise to work there. But again here, the situation is in a way we were very lucky to be born the years, at two years interval when we were born, because we were a first a generation. We were just before the baby boomer. We were six years before the baby boomers, so our generation was empty. It was in terms of Europe or even in a certain way the United States, but it's in Europe. We were an empty generation. We were few of us because... And then it was a time of decolonization.

Alain (01:36:14) So that's why all these countries were desperate to have some kind of expertise coming. And even if we were relatively inexperienced like when I went to Yemen, you had more responsibility that you would have otherwise. When I was in Yemen... Yeah, I was 30-years-old. A young guy of 30-years-old will never have the job I had in Yemen now. Where Yemen is a special case. But say in another Arab country you will be very junior assistant of somebody.

Alain (01:36:54) And so we were very, very lucky. And we also lucky to be able... We could travel that way because of that, because of this expertise we had in a decolonizing world. So people were ready to employ us without question.

Devon (01:37:15) Right. Those demographic shifts, the demographic trends make a really big difference in what opportunities are available.

Alain (01:37:22) And the political situation. The history of the world is changing, has changed. Colonization was a big, 19th century and just until the mid 20th century was a big thing, and decolonization was... Now this is over, the whole country's been free for a long time. So they have developed their own expertise. And so it's a different situation. So again, I am not so sure in what... As you say, it's not to just duplicate our career, it can never be done.

Alain (01:38:03) But we have to realize that we are in a very specific period. We live in a specific period and things are different. So, but I still think that for anybody interested in cities, living in many different cities is very important. I take again the simile of the doctor. You will not want to see a doctor who has seen only one patient in his whole life.

Alain (01:38:35) And so I think to be able, and to live... You see what is also important I think is to be in a city, not to do a study in a city. I mean you always learn something if you do a study, but to be in an executive position. To be the assistant of the chief planner or to be the planner or something where you have to take decision every day.

Alain (01:39:05) It's very different from saying, "Well, I'm doing a study and I would like to get your data." And you talk with the planners, you talk to them. And you may spend six months there, you may know the city pretty well, have friends there and that's nice. But you have to be in a position where you have to take decision, where you are really part of a local administration.

Alain (01:39:34) And this we had the luck to be in this position. When we were in Thailand, in Bangkok, we were working for the Housing Authority, which was purely Thai operation. We were the only two foreigners there. They were about 4,000 employees. But we were there not doing a study, we had a job there inside that. My job was to select a new land for low cost housing in Bangkok and to inference a policy of the Housing Authority. So this is what's important, other than to come and say, "I'm doing a study, could you give me your data?"

Devon (01:40:17) Yeah. The fastest way to learn is to have some responsibility, to have to actually answer a question and take action because it really sharpens your focus and helps you understand what you're trying to do.

Alain (01:40:29) And you see how decision are taken. You see the constraint.

Devon (01:40:36) Thanks so much for tuning in to our first episode. You can find a link to the transcript and photos in the description. The next episode will focus on the Bertaud's experience as parents and how raising children shaped how they saw the city. Thank you to the hundreds of helpful people on Twitter who offered feedback for this first episode.

Devon (01:40:56) I especially want to thank Michael Kleyn for volunteering his audio engineering expertise and to my friend Wheezy for the kick ass intro music. Special thanks also to Scott Hanselman, Daniel Compton, and Sonal Chokshi who helped me learn the basics of podcasting. If I make any mistakes, it's because I didn't listen to them closely enough.

Devon (01:41:19) And thanks to Market Urbanism for offering to financially sponsor the podcast. It was incredible to see how much unsolicited help we got just from sharing what we were doing on the internet. I'm continually surprised by how learning in public is always even better than I expect. See you next time.#cities

Comparing product development stories across the continentAt a conference in Nairobi two years ago, an engineer visiting from Rotterdam stunned me with how easy it was for his team to order electronic components: an order for a BLE chip placed on Thursday evening would be fulfilled by lunch on Friday. Only a month before that, my colleague and I had spent two weeks waiting for a Bluetooth module for a prototype we were taking to the same conference. And two weeks was fast: we had a relationship with a Sparkfun reseller in Lagos, Nigeria. Most orders for electronic components took, at best, a month to arrive.
Long fulfillment times are the norm for small product manufacturers in Africa. Prior to this BLE project, we spent a month (with no tracking information whatsoever) waiting for a capacitor order from Aliexpress. Orders like this are an exercise of faith and at the mercy of the postal service who only offer home delivery for letters; online purchases must be picked up in person at a service office. For both hackers and small manufacturers in these parts, long wait times and uncertainty are an unavoidable part of the product development process.
This article introduces Africa, first as a continent comprised of different countries and markets, then as home to creative entrepreneurs manufacturing products for everyday use. Next, we examine the supply chain difficulties they face and end with recommendations for improvement.African Supply in ContextSupply chain problems in Africa are quite complex, with most of them stemming from the sheer size of the continent. Africa’s land mass is greater than the USA, Europe, and China combined. Within this huge space there are 54 unique markets, few of which provide scale or adequate distribution infrastructure. Further complicating matters, there are over 2,000 languages spoken and very diverse cultural dynamics from one market to the next.

The true size of Africa, a project by Kai Krause & adapted by The Economist.While supply is difficult, the demand is quite high. Nigeria’s construction industry, for example, imports about 70% of the raw materials and equipment needed to execute its contracts. As e-commerce, in the mold of Amazon, has seen rapid adoption across the continent and with the postal services in many countries being inefficient, e-commerce startups (like Jumia - Africa’s first unicorn startup - and Konga) have developed their own logistics outfits using motorcycles and trucks to deliver products to customers.

These issues affect manufacturing and product development in untold ways. I spoke with Soji, a supply chain expert at a leading consumer packaged goods company (he asked that his employer not be named) in West Africa, and he asserted that government policy has the largest impact on supply chain. Policy, according to him, affects product duty brackets, market size, and final logistic costs. In addition to country specific regulations there are also regional blocs that operate free trade zones or have special trade relationships. Similar to the rules guiding the common EU market, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are examples of these relationships on the continent. While these regions have established rules and duty exemptions, enforcement is often ad hoc.Soji tells me two stories about these two blocs. Within COMESA, where the shipping of goods across internal borders is supposed to be duty free, some countries in the region still charge a 25% duty - the same as he pays on goods from Tilbury, England. As a result, many manufacturers decide to ship their raw materials from outside of the continent because they can get superior quality for the same price. These duties explain why Africa’s extra-regional trade is far greater than intra-regional trade, as shown in the table below.

Africa’s extra and intra-regional trade clearly shows that more trade is done outside the continent. Brookings, 2018
Meanwhile, the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme only charges 7% in duties for intra-region shipping, although moving from one country to another means paying transit fees as forward clearing (a payment by which the good is cleared to transit through a country on its way to another). To explain, let’s take a look at Ghana and Nigeria, two countries on the West African Atlantic coast. Both Ghana and Nigeria are members of ECOWAS, and both are English-speaking. They’re also both large economies: Nigeria has the largest GDP of any country in Africa, and Ghana has the 11th largest. Lagos and Accra (the densest cities in Nigeria and Ghana respectively) are about 460 km apart and connected by a highway which sees a lot of trade.

200 km 
Although they’re geographically close, the countries are separated by two other ECOWAS members - Togo and Benin, both of which are French-speaking. As a result, any trade done by truck would incur transit fees to both Togo and Benin and then an additional 7% duty in either Lagos or Accra.
To avoid that, some companies ship by sea. Both Lagos and Accra have large ports, and a direct vessel between the two will usually berth within 24 hours. But shipping companies often take up to a week to process and send bills of lading, delaying their goods’ progress through customs - and incurring daily rent on the vessels that carry them.
These barriers make it very difficult for smaller businesses — especially those working on new product development — to operate across borders in Africa. Multinationals, on the other hand, use two main strategies to reduce their costs. First, some large companies have been able to negotiate special treatment from the countries they operate in. Others with subsidiaries in each country of operation can ship goods from subsidiary to subsidiary, taking advantage of transfer pricing (the rules and methods that govern intracompany trades) to transfer goods and services to countries with better tax regimes than others, thereby increasing their profit and optimizing their inventory.
In different parts of the continent, entrepreneurs are managing their manufacturing process uniquely to reduce the impact of supply chain challenges on their business. While their products and business models are different, as are their scale and needs, each startup faces some of the same issues. To understand how they solve them and how these issues directly impact their business, I took a closer look at four companies across the continent.Door-to-door Shipping in NigeriaContract manufacturing may be associated with China, but Jude Abalaka is working hard to change that notion in Lagos, Nigeria. Tranos Contracting, a company he founded in 2010, manufactures a wide range of industrial products: steel enclosures for power generators, plastic enclosures for electrical devices, electrical panels, and diesel generators. They will begin manufacturing switches and sockets for consumer markets in the coming months.

Like any thriving business, Tranos is constantly looking to expand - in their case, into consumer goods. This expansion comes with its own supply chain headaches, which are indicative of the issues that plague African manufacturers. In an interview earlier this year, he lamented about having to order materials 3–6 months ahead of production to avoid clearing delays at the seaport.

"About 30% of our inventory is ordered from overseas and mostly shipped by sea, except [if] the item is light and urgent", he wrote in an email. To manage this delay, Tranos keeps excess inventory on hand (tying up capital and making his business less nimble), though at times there are inevitable shortages that hold up production

Apart from production roadblocks, even just procuring manufacturing equipment has its own logistical challenges.

Last year, as part of their expansion efforts, Tranos imported an injection molding machine. This took months to accomplish. After rounds of due diligence, they engaged a logistics company to do door-to-door shipping. FOB Logistics would pick up the machine in Bengaluru, India, manage the freight forwarding, clear customs, and pay duties as well as any inland logistics costs, before finally delivering it to Tranos in Lagos.

"By engaging with these [door-to-door] companies, we can trust that the goods will arrive in due time", says Remi Akeusola, a supply chain manager at Tranos. Logistics firms deal with the port’s authorities regularly, importing multiple goods for different clients, and thus have a much smoother process clearing machines than startups. He goes on to describe the factors that necessitate using the services of a logistics company. "It boils down to the cost, time frame of clearing and the response time in picking up the item from the manufacturers." Engaging the services of logistics companies does not come cheap, as they charge a percentage of the total invoice value, a price that is probably too steep for some companies.Delivery by Proxy in EgyptRisha, the word in Arabic for feather, symbolized the objective of Moushira Elamrawy and her Risha Laser team: To create a laser cutter that is light, open source, and portable -- like a feather. A Risha is also easy to use: a user would send a picture to the laser cutter to cut or engrave the image on light materials.

Built into the laser cutter’s design is its ease of assembly. The mechanical parts: 3D prints, threaded rods, and bolts were easily found in the spare parts markets in Alexandria; the electronic components were sourced from sound and lighting technicians — their main business being setting up elaborate Egyptian weddings — and university engineering departments. The last component, a 700mW laser diode, was purchased off Amazon.

However, Amazon did not ship the laser diode to Egypt. Moushira would ship batches of the part to a friend or colleague coming back to Egypt from the US or Europe, who would check the package in as their luggage, to avoid questions at customs."[Border] Security would ask you ‘Why are you bringing this into the country? What are you using it for?’", she tells me.

When she tried shipping a part to Alexandria, the import duties and taxes were prohibitive - at times double the part’s cost. To make matters worse, many of her international purchases are subject to large fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In November 2016, when Egypt’s central bank floated their currency to clinch a $12bn loan from the International Monetary Fund, the Egyptian Pound was devalued and ruined an order Risha was making for diodes. Just before the devaluation, Moushira had made an order of 70 USD, about 1,000 EGP at the time. After the devaluation she was asked to pay 6 to 7 times that.Times are better now, she says. As part of her belongings, she counts 10 Arduinos bought from online electronics stores like Future Electronics and RAM Electronics - purchases that would have been impossible before the 2011 revolution. Although electronics have always been sold in stores, buying parts like ATmega and other microcontrollers is easier now.
Risha is currently on a hiatus, but Moushira is busy. When she is not working with an educational institution to open a makerspace, she is advising the government on new policies to support engineering product development to promote technology export.Inventory Forecasting in South AfricaCape Town is a beautiful port city on South Africa’s southwest coast. It is a popular tourist attraction for its weather, fauna, and Robben Island - where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. The legacy of apartheid is chiefly responsible for South Africa being the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Due to this, the chronically poor live in shanty-towns and slums like Khayelitsha in the center of the city. 
In 2013, a huge fire broke out in this slum claiming five lives, razing 800 shacks, and displacing 4,000 people. In response, a group at the University of Cape Town developed Lumkani — a heat detector built on a mesh network with a backend system the team calls ‘Watch Tower’. The devices are portable and easy for homeowners to install themselves. When a Lumkani device detects a fire, it raises an alarm over text message with the GPS coordinates of the detecting device.

South Africa is on the Southern tip of the continent. Map courtesy of mapchart.net.Initially set up as a social enterprise, Lumkani was launched as an Indiegogo campaign in 2015 and has since used grant funding to build a manufacturing business. In addition, they have rolled out an insurance product where homes with the devices are underwritten by Hollard Group to a value of about 40,000 Rand (about 2,650 USD); they also have plans to expand to other home detection products. Just three months ago, they closed a seed funding round.
Their supply chain has evolved since 2015, with more parts coming from overseas now. "90% of the components are manufactured or sourced out of China and we use local distributors to deliver the parts" says Craig Burden, Lumkani’s Lead Engineer.
After the components arrive in Cape Town, Lumkani hands them off to a local manufacturing outfit who populates the PCBAs, performs product assembly, and packages the devices. With this set up, their weekly production capacity is 2,000 units.
The signature light blue plastic casing that covers the product is manufactured in China as it costs less than manufacturing locally — even with the duties and freight charges. In addition to cost, their Chinese contract manufacturer provides better service than their previous, local, manufacturer.

Remote manufacturing partners aren’t without their costs, however. "Because it takes about a month to a month and half to arrive by sea, we order on average 25,000 cases not less than two months in advance of when we want them here" Craig included. Even more challenging are component orders. Thanks to the recent worldwide capacitor shortage - which has affected businesses in Africa as anywhere else - Lumkani’s capacitor orders take about 22–35 weeks to arrive. Even though they engage the services of registered South African distributors, the delivery times vary by component and season.
"We’ve had to develop some tricks" he says. One trick is to order components from lesser known manufacturers; the other is to engage with trusted buying houses, essentially stock keepers who provide no guarantees, source the components from any supplier, and have no return policy. "These stock keepers could even be people buying components at the market in Shenzhen, but we have to trust them because for a lot of our components we can’t get them from anywhere else."  Whatever it takes to get the job done.Cross Border Shipping from KenyaCooking stoves in many parts of the world run on coal, wood, and other polluting fuels. For a while now, there has been a worldwide drive to make these stoves run cleaner: using less fuel and producing less smoke and emissions.
In Kenya, this drive is one of the reasons behind BURN Stoves, a stove manufacturer in Nairobi. They have three product offerings with prices ranging from $38.90 to $52.50, all made completely in house. The stoves are sold through micro-finance institutions and retail in supermarkets in Kenya and a few neighboring.

Moving manufacturing to Ruiru has impacted their logistics, and, in turn, their lead times, with local government policy now playing a tremendous role. For example, the ports they use — in Mombasa and Nairobi —  are currently undergoing structural changes, causing clearing to take significantly longer.

"The best we’ve ever done was about 10 days, that was amazing! Now, the average is about 3-4 weeks passing through customs and the KRA [Kenya Revenue Authority]," Mohammed Ali, who manages their logistics, told me. To manage this, their part orders are made four months in advance, using the sales team’s volume predictions. However, a lot can change in four months: policy, weather effects, and even taxes. In their usual orders they add a four week buffer for imported materials — one week for locally sourced parts — but from time to time they run out of stock, causing them to either halt the production line or only make partial stoves. Distribution presents another set of challenges, as they have had to build their own delivery network. Within Kenya, the company has its own logistics infrastructure - using trucks to move the stoves across the country; on occasion it engages Wells Fargo, a logistics company (not the American bank). BURN also sells its stoves in Tanzania (shown on the map in orange), Rwanda (green) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (blue). To get their finished stoves to these countries, they ship by air, land, and sea freight.

At up to $4 per kg, air is extremely expensive. The stoves each weigh roughly 5kg and would cost about $20 each to fly: more than half the price of some of their stoves.

Shipping by land is often the most cost effective option, but proves difficult in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to its dense forest regions and unpredictable politics. So far, they have succeeded by employing the services of middle men or shipping by boat.

"We have had to ship to Congo many times by sea around the Southern coast of Africa" says Mohammed, a voyage that could last up to 3 weeks. In rare occasions they have tried shipping by small boats, but these offer no insurance and are highly unpredictable. These distribution challenges impact how fast BURN can deliver to their customers in foreign markets and limits their plans for expansion; a supply chain is only as strong as its certainties.The Way ForwardThese four companies are very different. Risha was founded and run on a small scale out of a makerspace; Lumkani has used a combination of crowdfunding and grants; Tranos serves local businesses as a contract manufacturer; BURN ships overseas at a large volume.  Each faces similar supply chain challenges, and has made sacrifices in an effort to produce exportable technology and grow a sustainable business.
For these companies, reducing their supply chain woes would greatly improve their operations. With an improved clearing process and more efficient ports, BURN would be able to predict their sales closer to the time of sale and maintain a smaller inventory. With a more informed customs force, Risha can source diodes to produce laser cutters on a schedule. Tranos would get their new products to market faster and ship their tools faster enabled by smoother freight forwarding. While with enough stock on their hands, Lumkani would deliver bulk orders more confidently.
For makers developing new product concepts, improving their access to components will reduce their development time. But the actions required to achieve these objectives are not clear cut.
An EY report from 2014 (PDF) prescribes a number of opportunities worth exploring. Chief among them is to improve the shipping network, integrating road and sea freight, especially within regional entities. None of the startups I interviewed for this article sourced materials from other countries within the continent. Instead, when they couldn’t find in their locale, they went outside the continent. Improving the road networks within countries, along with more open borders, will accelerate the movement of goods within Africa.
That said, most materials will continue to be shipped from outside markets - especially from Asia. To improve lead times, more distributors (with consistent stock of commonly used parts) need to be present across the different regions of Africa. While it seems intuitive that where there is demand there should be supply, the lack of distributors is due to the fact that many hardware developers work in silos, often with no informal network. Without such networks, would-be distributors have no insight about the local demand. In addition, the high exchange rates of local currencies to the dollar affects the ability of entrepreneurs to order parts they need.
For companies like Risha and Lumkani it’s possible that makerspaces could act as a distributor, providing tools and components for product developers to work with. Some of these already exist in Kenya and Ghana. Gearbox (Kenya) provides industrial tools and training for hardware entrepreneurship in a flexible working space, as does Kumasi Hive (Ghana). These spaces regularly order parts from overseas so that their members always have the tools to work.
Bigger companies, like BURN, could work with the fledgling e-commerce startups by offering their products to be sold and distributed on these platforms. With these platforms they could forecast their sales better and even outsource delivery, saving the cost that they bear and reducing the uncertainty of shipping. Better forecasts inform slimmer inventory, bringing their manufacturing to a just-in-time process.
The biggest opportunity lies with policy. Simplifying duties and clearing procedures at the ports would greatly improve the supply chain, and pairing these with a technology development policy would be a double win. Some of the options of such policy could be:•Relax duties and import tariffs on electronic components, especially when an industry that uses such components is budding. Unfortunately, current trends don’t point in this direction: eight months ago, the Nigerian government increased the tariffs on solar panels by 100%. Such moves hamper the development on renewable technology products — a growing industry in the country.•Allow tax relief for a number of years to companies beginning technology export. This will create an incentive for entrepreneurs to develop products for export, especially in countries that have cheap access to raw materials.•Open regional trade areas and enforce the rules. The continent is big enough to trade within itself, but the gatekeepers need to keep the gates open for the markets to dictate the price and direction. The Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) agreement aims to achieve this, but member nations have been known to undermine such agreements in the past.These steps require a refocus with governments looking to the future instead. The continent produces 11 million youths who join the workforce every year. As such, governments look for Foreign Direct Investment from multinationals in the FMCG and construction industries who can provide this.
This model is not sustainable as the jobs created are not highly skilled and labour costs could always increase; essentially, governments are focusing on easy solutions and ignoring the long term benefits that other options might offer. By formulating policies around technology export and providing an enabling environment for product development, these hardware startups will eventually create jobs, improve the talent pipeline, and grow the countries’ GDP.Chuma Asuzu is a designer and engineer who writes about technology in Africa.

                  Edge Esmeralda: A recap of June's popup village
                  

August 26th, 2024
This summer, I co-organized a month-long 1,300-person "popup village" in Healdsburg, CA called Edge Esmeralda. This gathering was incredibly fun and rewarding, and it was also a huge accelerant to the creation of the permanent village we are building, Esmeralda.

Edge Esmeralda is happening again next year! Mark your calendar: May 24 - June 21, 2025
A huge challenge when building a town is that the feedback loops are very, very long. Instead of accepting this fact, I decided that we have to get creative to find ways to learn and adjust, because within a few years we will literally be laying our plans in concrete.

Edge Esmeralda was essentially a prototype to learn about how we want to approach building the Esmeralda permanent community, both the "hardware" (urbanism, infrastructure, architecture, etc) and the "software" (events, programming, culture, etc).

The Edge Esmeralda "popup village" was 30 days long, and it took place scattered throughout a charming 11,000-person town in Sonoma County called Healdsburg. This extended gathering gave us an opportunity to put our ideas into practice and learn firsthand which ones we want to incorporate as we the permanent community — more importantly, which ones we'll want to leave behind, or at least adjust. 

These learnings ranged widely, such as:What makes a great town squareHow to integrate kids while maintaining expert-level programmingWhere to provide the lightest amount of structure and routine for the group to allow the emergent creativity of the attendees to make awesome things happenHow to approach local outreach to make existing residents feel includedWhich restaurant layouts and acoustics make for the best nightly community dinnersHow far apart is too far apart for things to feel easily accessible on foot
It's hard to capture EE in a blog post — it was really more of an ecosystem like a college campus or city than a single tracked event — but these stats will give you a sense of what the month looked like:~1,300 people joined us during the month of June80 kids attended Edge Esmeralda6 weeks old & 86 years old, the ages of the youngest & oldest attendees25 expert-led program tracks551 sessions throughout the month93% were organized by attendees, with just 7% planned directly by the Edge Esmeralda organizing team!167 unique session hosts3x increase in Bird Bike usage in the town during the event – and that doesn’t even count the bikes people rented or brought, separate from Bird, which was a much larger number!350 redwood trees funded by donations from a solar-powered night market, organized entirely by attendees
Read the Edge Esmeralda 2024 recap →

The coolest thing to me is that our design principles focused on emergence, so we didn’t actually know precisely what would happen. Instead, we created the container and then watched it unfold. In other words, all the cool things that happened were because the attendees saw it as an opportunity to make something awesome out of it.

One of my favorite examples was the Solar A-frames project, catalyzed by Nick Foley and Anson Yu/ Over the course of a few weeks, they led a group of attendees to build an A-frame made out of solar panels up in a formerly burned redwood forest close to town, which ended up hosting the spectacular Golden Future Night Market and the memorable Closing Ceremony.
I feel incredibly lucky to have gotten to collaborate with Edge City to make Edge Esmeralda a reality. It's one of the most rewarding things I've ever worked on, and they were incredible partners in bringing this to life. 
"Edge Esmeralda was one of the weirdest, wildest, most ambitious, most unexpected — and most fun — things I’ve ever watched unfold in Healdsburg."
— Simone Wilson, Healdsburg Tribune
In fact we had such a good time, and so many people asked us to do it again so they could come longer next time, that we have decided to organize Edge Esmeralda again! Mark your calendars: May 24 - June 21, 2025. Hope to see you there!

                  For the greater good: the game theory of zoning
                  

November 16th, 2018
Pro-housing advocates criticize "NIMBYs" as being uncooperative and selfish. However that's not how the so-called NIMBYs see themselves. The difference is a question of the granularity of your analysis.

Individualists vs Localists
A question I hear a lot is: "Why do NIMBY homeowners support zoning laws? Isn't it in their best interest to allow for the highest and best use so that they can sell their own property for the maximum price? Don't they want freedom to do as they please with their land?" At a first level, this analysis is correct. Homeowners do want to have complete freedom to build whatever they want on their own property (or to sell to someone who will). We'll call this the Individualist perspective.

However, the calculus changes once you zoom out and consider the neighborhood as a whole. The utility for a particular homeowner becomes dominated by the actions of their neighbors rather than their own. To be precise:We are considering individual homeowners as our base unit of analysis.We're aiming for the maximum welfare for a neighborhood, i.e. a group of these individual homeowners who all have to deal with the actions of each other.
Imagine you live in a suburban neighborhood with many single-family homes. There are 10 lots on the block, and 1 of them gets sold to a developer who bulldozes the small house and replaces it with a massive apartment complex. The 1 guy who sold to the developer is happy because he's just made a bunch of money, but the other 9 families now have to deal with the construction, a big change in the physical design of the neighborhood, and a change in the kind and number of neighbors they have. They aren't guaranteed to dislike it, but this big change invites a risk to their way of life. Since each owner has more neighbors than lots to sell, each one is more likely to be on the losing side of that deal than on the winning side. As a result, they are willing to sacrifice some freedom in what they do (or what their buyer does) with the lot in order to buy the control of their neighbors' behavior.

Put more generally: in any given year each homeowner is unlikely to sell, but it's very likely that someone in their neighborhood will sell. Each owner has n-1 neighbors and there's only 1 of themselves, so summing up all their individual small likelihoods of selling produces a much higher likelihood that the community will change in a way unwanted by that neighbor.

With this perspective, the rational thing to do is work together to add tighter zoning restrictions in order to curtail damaging behavior by your neighbors. We'll call this the Localist perspective.

There will always be a few owners who are more interested in doing something controversial with their property than with maintaining the status quo, so it's not quite as simple as saying that all neighbors will suddenly work together in the interest of the overall neighborhood. In any given neighborhood there's a mix of Individualists and Localists, and the ratio varies from place to place.

In many communities across the US, the Localists have won out. Although adding restrictions via zoning laws is slightly worse for each owner in isolation, it restrains them each from behaving in ways that erodes much more welfare for all the others, and they're more likely to find themselves on the raw end of the deal than not. The result: neighbors self-organize to constrain everyone's behavior for the greater good of the community. In other words, restrictive zoning laws that retard development are a good thing! Right? Not so fast...

Localists vs Regionalists
Let's zoom out one more time and look at neighborhoods as our base unit of analysis, rather than the individuals that constitute a neighborhood. Growth and change are important for the health of a region's economy, so it's important that there's space for development as a whole, despite inconvenience in the short term. Development grows the size of the economic pie for everyone in the long run. This raises another question I hear a lot: "If development increases the value in a region in the long-run, why don't homeowners support it? Doesn't this increase their property values?"

This is a good question! This growing pie narrative does seem to contradict the common pro-housing criticism that "NIMBYs" are just selfishly protecting their home values. This contradiction can be resolved if we consider the vast differences between (a) long- vs short-term ramifications and (b) communal vs personal ramifications.

In the long-term, yes, good development will improve a region’s lot, and the community will be better off overall. However in the short-term, development may disrupt daily life, and gains will not be distributed equally throughout that region. As a concrete example: say development means building a new fire station. The region as a whole benefits—more fire safety!—but the next-door neighbors will suffer from the sirens going off day and night. It's important to not overlook the local, short-term costs that individuals might bear in lieu of whatever global, long-term benefits might exist.

Those costs are the ones borne by individual homeowners, the ones that mean each neighborhood will tend to internally cooperate to retard local development. A region may benefit overall from development, but a region is made up of neighborhoods, and none of them wants to bear the brunt of that change.

Again to be precise:We are considering neighborhoods as our base unit of analysis, andWe're aiming for the maximum welfare for a region, i.e. a group of neighborhoods.
To resolve this problem, neighborhoods have to cooperate with each other. We'll call the folks who advocate this kind of inter-neighborhood cooperation Regionalists. Ironically their goals look quite a bit for what the Individualists pushed for all along: allow for development. The difference is that this time we'll punish those neighborhoods that "collude" to restrict it. This time the tension isn't Individualists vs Localists but rather Localists vs Regionalists.

Interesting dynamics to note here:The "ends" of the Individualists and Regionalists look very similar. Both want to remove zoning controls to enable development. The "means" of the Localists and Regionalists look very similar. Both constrain the behavior of the layer below (Localists stifling Individualists, Regionalists stifling Localists) to get their intended outcome.Individualists and Regionalists are odd bedfellows. In practice they can form a coalition to defeat Localists, but they tend to disagree on other things, and the same power they may muster here to constrain local behavior can also be used in other realms to vanquish other Individualist aims. As a result it can be scary for Individualists to cooperate with Regionalists. 
So what?
In conversations about housing, Regionalists tend to condemn the Localists as selfish and uncooperative, when it's really more of a question of what level of analysis you're looking at. These Localists are focused at the level of their local community and see their actions as maximizing the value for everyone in it; critics focus on a zoom level up and see that this local behavior creates global problems for the system. Both levels of analysis are correct. The challenge is determining which one should overrule the other, and under what circumstances.

This muddies some of the rhetoric both pro- and anti-housing advocates use:Both groups claim they're protecting "the greater good", but it's not so clear what that means. Are we talking about the good of our neighborhood or the good of our region?Both groups also assert that they are upholding "independence" and "self-determination", but again it depends on what level of analysis you're focusing on. On one hand Localists want to make decisions about how their communities function, while on the other hand Individualists want to make decisions about how to use their own property.It's also not so clear what it means to have "self-determination". Are we talking about freedom to act as we please or freedom from our world changing out of our control?
I tend to be much more of a Regionalist (or sometimes an Individualist) than a Localist. However I do sympathize with the dilemma that the Localists face. Their home is where they live, where they raised their kids, and in most cases their single biggest asset. This of course does not give them a free pass. But rather than demonize them as selfish or irrational, it's important to understand where they're coming from.

Thanks to Chris Beiser, Sebastián Bensusan, Omar Rizwan, and John Backus for feedback on this post ☺️

Epistemic status: 90% confident in the consequences of the simplified models I've laid out here, and 70% confident that those simplified models actually describe reality in a useful way.
Epistemic effort: I've been thinking about these concepts for a long time. Last week I did a 1h quickwrite to brain dump my thoughts on the subject, then I spent two evenings revising those so they actually made sense. The result is what you see here.
Purpose: I've heard these themes again and again throughout land use nerdom, yet I've never seen them laid out in one place so I think it could be useful to other people trying to understand the "common wisdom". Secondly, I'm curious to test this mental model I've built up over time, because I've come to take for granted that this is how people understand the game theory of zoning law but never actually asked in a comprehensive, structured way. So please do let me know if you don't think the ideas below self-evident, or better yet if you disagree outright! 
This post will dive into the game theory around these two common questions:Why do NIMBY homeowners support zoning laws? Isn't it in their best interest to allow for the highest and best use so that they can sell their own property for the maximum price? Don't they want freedom to do as they please with their land?If development increases a region's value in the long-run, why don't homeowners support it? Doesn't this increase their property values?

 The new city in California


                  The new city in California
                  

February 16th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and the plan is going to a vote in Solano County’s November election. The proposed location is in Solano County, about halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento, and the group behind the proposal is named California Forever.

As a native Californian, I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This new city could make a huge impact on making housing more affordable across the state, improving quality of life by creating the first new walkable city in America in the last 100 years, and reducing environmental impacts. While the new city also has serious technical and political barriers to overcome, the proposal is bold yet also grounded in reality.
A map showing the location of the new city that California Forever has proposed in Solano CountyCalifornia Forever's renderings depict a walkable urban fabric with with schools, office, & factoriesI spent the last few weeks studying California Forever’s plan and talking to their team, and I’m impressed by the depth of their thinking. I also know several of the key people involved, so some of what I know is from talking with them on background as well. I’ve written up what I’ve learned into this series. I hope it can be helpful to anyone else who’s trying to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and I’ll continue adding to the series as I learn more:Intro: The new city in California (this post!)Part 1: The story of California Forever so farPart 2: Clustered development will preserve California’s landscapePart 3: The first walkable city in America in a centuryPart 4: Success is tied to benefiting existing Solano residentsPart 5: Relationship with Travis Air Force BasePart 6: Is the proposed new city in California climate resilient? 
California Forever is a moonshot, and like all moonshots it’s also a longshot. But if they do get approval from voters in November, the new city could improve the quality of life and opportunity not just for Solano County residents but for everyone in California.

I’ve written about urban planning and new cities in particular a lot over the years. You can find those posts here to read more about how I think about cities and to put California Forever’s proposal into context.
*These are planned posts, still works in progress! I will publish them soon.

                  Zonificación norteamericana vs japonesa
                  

November 29th, 2018
This is a Spanish translation of notes from about a year ago. You can find the original in English here.

Estas notas provienen de leer dos publicaciones del blog fantástico Urban Kchoze:Urban kchoze: Japanese zoning (aquí está la copia anotada)Urban kchoze: Euclidian zoning (aquí está la copia anotada)
El sistema japonés es inclusivo, distinto al sistema americano que es exclusivo. La forma típica de zonificación en America se llama zonificación euclidiana, que especifica los usos permitidos y dimensiones para una zona. Las zonas japonesas limitan la "molestia máxima" en una zona y permiten cualquier desarrollo por debajo de este límite (por ejemplo una fábrica no se puede construir en un barrio residencial, pero las viviendas se pueden construir en una zona industrial). Podés pensar en eso como una manera de "whitelist" y de "blacklist". El resultado en el caso japonés es mucho más desarrollado, mientras en los Estados Unidos el uso del suelo es mucho más segregado. 

Costumbres de zonificación en Japón 🇯🇵La zonificación es una ley nacional, no un estatuto municipalEn los EE.UU, las ciudades controlan su propia zonificación, pero muchas no tienen la habilidad para planificar bien una ciudadEn Japón, el gobierno nacional moviliza expertos para hacer un buen conjunto de leyesLa aplicación local se deja a los gobiernos de las ciudades, por lo que las ciudades tienen el poder de ejecución, pero tienen pautas para trabajar por fueraLa desventaja — menos posibilidades de experimentación Solamente hay 12 zonas Varían de zonas residenciales de baja altura hasta zonas exclusivamente industriales En los EE.UU, frecuentemente hay cientos de zonas diferentes Las zonas permiten un uso máximo en lugar de un uso exclusivo para cada unaEl principio japonés es incluir todos los usos hasta un nivel de molestia máximo, por lo que se permiten usos de baja molestia en todos partesSe permite cada uso considerado menos que el nivel que una molestia que una zona específica, y por eso usos de baja molestia se permiten en todos ladosComo resultado, casi todas las zonas japonesas permiten desarrollo de uso mixtoEn la zonificación norteamericana una zona específica aquello que está permitido (como un "whitelist"), y hay zonas que permiten solamente uno o dos usosLos departamentos de planificación necesitan "micro-manage" los detalles más pequeños—si se olvidan de hacer suficientes zonas para negocios o escuelas, necesitan cambiarlas luego y confrontar los NIMBYs (los que no quieren el desarrollo y cambio, porque les afecta más de lo que les sirve)Muchos usos necesarios son olvidados. Luego tienen que construirse en las afueras de la ciudad.La necesidad de "hyper-competent micromanaging" es muy reducida en la planificación japonesaNo diferencia entre tipos de usos residencialesLa zonificación norteamericana tiende a tratar unifamiliar y multifamiliar como dos usos separados para mantener segregados En Japón, si un edificio proporciona una vivienda para la gente, es residencial. Eso es todo lo que importa—ya sea que se alquile, se posea, tenga una o dos casas, no importa Las proporciones máximas del terreno restringen qué tan altos y densos pueden ser los edificiosPor eso no vas a tener un bloque de apartamentos de 10 pisos en el medio de muchas casas unifamiliares En las ciudades americanas, si el departamento de planificación no planea suficientes zonas multifamiliares o unifamiliares, se pueden producir grandes problemasEs posible que se cree una escasez, aumentando el precio para este tipo de alojamiento En práctica, las unidades de alquiler terminan con peores acuerdos, resultando en alquileres altísimos (el ejemplo típico es San Francisco...)En Japón, las casas multifamiliares tienden a congregarse alrededor de las escuelas, áreas comerciales, o estaciones de tren. Esto es así, porque el costo por metro cuadrado de los usos multifamilares es menor que el de las unifamiliares Los límites de altura son racionales en lugar de arbitrariosCuanto más lejos de la calle esté el edificio y más amplia sea la calle, más alto puede ser (el edificio)A veces hay excepciones a estas reglas cuando quieren construir edificios más altos, pero se necesitan permisos especialesEn los EE.UU, las reglas son determinadas por lo que ya está en el barrioLas ciudades tienen el derecho de hacer excepciones, exigir criterios geométricos específicos, etcPero los defaults son determinados por el gobierno nacionalResultadosEl modelo japonés ha creado y protegido entornos urbanos que son más enfocados en la gente y más transitables a pie Más basado en el mercado y responsivo a la demandaNo es el único modelo e.g. los New Urbanists abogan por zonificación basada en la forma para favorecer el uso peatonal y permitir el desarrollo de uso mixto

Las prácticas de zonificación americanas: Zonificación euclidiana 🇺🇸Un suburbio norteamericano típico forma bloques de casas unifamiliares casi idénticas Eso no es un fenómeno emergente, en que los individuales simplemente eligen construir sus casas de la misma maneraZonificación es definida y estrictamente limite el desarrollo urbano En Norteamérica, las normas típicas son que llamadas "euclidian zoning"Extremadamente estrictasSe consideran casas de uni- y multifamiliares como usos separados que deben ser aislados. Es lo mismo para casas adosadas y casas totalmente independientes Hay un gran contraste con la zonificación de Japón (y muchas partes del resto de Asia y Europa), que considera uso residencial como residencialEl nombre viene de la ciudad de Euclid, OhioEl origen es segregación racialAl principio, la zonificación prohibía explícitamente ciertas razas Cuando fue declarado inconstitucional, se usaron otras maneras de alcanzar el mismo resultadoLas minorías eran desproporcionadamente pobres haciendo más probable que alquilaran, y cuando eran propietarios tendían a comprar casas mas chicas. Por eso, la zonificación:Prohibía edificios multifamiliares en zonas unifamiliares yEstablecía mínimos para los tamaños de lotes y edificiosLimita mucho la densidad Por que?Simple aplicarlo—simplemente debe medirse las dimensiones y luego mirar si cumplen las reglasSatisfice a los que desean a controlar el área de construcción de su barrio inmediato, pero es terrible para el "macro-management" de comunidades decentes El barrio no cambia mucho una vez que está construido => a los NIMBYs les encantaConsequencias Retrasa y mata proyectos => estrangula el redesarrollo y "mantiene barrios en formaldehyde", efectivamente haciéndolo ilegal Última herramienta de empoderamiento para NIMBYsIrónicamente, significa que el único momento en el que vale la pena para los desarrolladores confrontar NIMBYs es para construir torres de condos, porque el lucro de unidades más densas justifica la lucha. Cualquier cosa más pequeña no vale la penaSin embargo, los dúplex / hileras / etc serían una evolución mejor y más gradualResulta en la expansión urbana, por que es más fácil construir hacia afuera que densificar Si la tierra está reservada solamente para casas unifamiliares y desprendidas, el lucro de cada metro cuadrado es mantenido artificialmente bajoUn exceso de oferta de lotes unifamiliares Una escasez de tierra para desarrollo multifamiliar y commercial Fomenta la corrupciónCuando la zonificación obstruye un proyecto muy lucrativo, se necesita una excepción para permitirloLos desarrolladores tienen el incentivo de comprar oficiales elegidos

 The Death and Life of American Company Towns


                  The Death and Life of American Company Towns
                  

June 29th, 2016
Google feeds its employees well. No Googler's desk is further than 150 feet from a "micro kitchen" stocked with goodies, and the campus is dotted with over 20 restaurants and cafes. Everything on the menu is free of charge to Googlers and their guests, and it includes specialities like creme brûlée and fresh handmade sushi.
The perks of working at Google extend far beyond the free food and snacks. Google HQ contains a bowling alley, bocce ball courts, sand volleyball, and infinite swimming pools. Showers at the fitness center provide towels to employees, allowing them to freshen up after a midday workout. Googlers can conveniently complete their personal chores at the on-campus hairdresser, mechanic, medical clinic, and laundromat, and they can relax and think through work challenges with a long massage.
Google also ensures that employees' families are well-cared for. The company subsidizes daycare and offers 22 weeks of paid maternity leave to new mothers. If an employee dies, his stocks are fully vested at once and the spouse receive half of his salary for the next 10 years.
Tech companies are famous for their incredible employee benefits. Workers in other industries talk longingly about the wifi-outfitted work shuttles, catered meals, and dog-friendly offices. While these benefits appear uniquely generous, they descend from a long history of corporate paternalism with roots in Industrial Revolution-era company towns. These towns served the same fundamental purpose as Google's generous benefits today—to attract, retain, and shape loyal employees.

Origins
The earliest company towns were constructed out of necessity. Extraction industries such as logging and mining were naturally found in remote locations in Appalachia or further west, far from the reaches of urbanization. The automobile was rare among the working class, and train routes rarely catered to passengers. "It would have been impractical for men to commute, even on weekends," wrote James Allen in his book The Company Town in the American West.
These early company towns resembled refugee camps, comprising rows of tents with no running water or electricity. Workers were attracted to these jobs for their high wages rather than the living conditions. However, the men soon discovered that their cost of living was even higher. Prices at the company store reflected the costly long-distance travel to these working camps, and employers abused their monopoly as the only shop in town to inflate the prices further. Workers' high wages flowed back into the pockets of the corporation that paid them. These early towns functioned to basically enslave employees, tying them to their debts at the company store.
However, it became difficult for employers to maintain the imbalance of this relationship. The vast distances from company towns to the rest of civilization quickly shrank as America steadily moved west, workers' unions strengthened, and urban factories became the dominant employers. Company towns evolved in these changing conditions rather than disappearing. While these towns had previously served to house and extort workers, they became a tool to attract and mold them.

Recruiting & retaining the best workers
Companies quickly found that generous benefits could attract and retain the most loyal and productive employees. In particular, employers sought family men over the rowdy bachelors who had populated earlier company towns. Married men were thought to be more stable, "less likely to carouse" because they would be more settled with the presence of a wife and children. 
"The married ones tended to stay around. We lose money on the town," explained Stanwood Murphy, President of the Pacific Lumber Company. "We figure it's worth it though, to keep a good crew here."
The Endicott-Johnson Corporation, a New York-based shoe manufacturer, offered especially extensive benefits (as I’ve written about before). Famously, rides on the many carousels in Johnson City were free to all. Its "Square Deal" program included comprehensive healthcare, affordable housing, swimming pools, theaters, and golf courses. To factory workers in the early 1900s, Johnson City was utopia. This was particularly attractive to immigrants, as company towns immediately gave workers a home and credit at the company store.
Workers flocked to EJ's shoe factories, and the company was consistently profitable despite providing the highest wages in the industry. The EJ brand of welfare capitalism fostered an intense devotion to the company and offered security even in harsh economic times. However, the Square Deal had implications beyond the employee's working and living conditions. Daily life was structured around factory hours and the demands of the market. It implicitly demanded absolute loyalty from workers, and it discouraged unionizing in a time when conflict between labor and industry was at its height.

Molding the perfect employee
Corporations soon found another benefit to building company towns around their factories rather than sourcing labor from already densely-populated cities: they were eager to keep workers away from radicalizing elements in cities.
"The anarchists and socialists were ... continually breeding discontent among our workmen and inciting them to strike," said piano manufacturer William Steinway.
Acting as both landlord and employer gave corporations the ability to evict anyone who went on strike and to manage their day-to-day lives. Constructing their own utopias enabled employers to control as well as attract the perfect employee.
Perhaps the most infamous company town of the Industrial Revolution was Pullman, Illinois which was built by train car manufacturer George Pullman in 1884. That era marked the initiation of the American labor movement, characterized by a series of violent strikes. Pullman envisioned his company town as a place where there would be no need for a strike and built what he called a "model community" in hopes of suppressing any labor unrest. The result was 1,000 residences with yards, daily trash removal, indoor plumbing, and gas, rare amenities for industrial workers of that era.

Generous corporations like Pullman and EJ did fare better than most during this period of increasingly organized labor. However, they were not entirely spared their employees' grievances. Living conditions in Pullman were far better than the industry standard, but the employees' idyllic lives were extremely restricted. Alcohol was prohibited within the town limits, except at the fancy Hotel Florence which was strictly off-limits to factory workers. Every photo of the town's beautiful parks and rolling lawns from that era is empty of people, because public gatherings had to receive explicit permission from the corporation.
Resentment for these policies boiled under the surface for years, and when the company slashed wages with no rent reduction in 1894, the workers revolted. The damages of the railcar strike extended so far across the nation that President Grover Cleveland ordered in the Army to stop the strikers from obstructing the trains. In the aftermath, a commission found George Pullman's paternalism partly to blame and annexed the town into greater Chicago. Cleveland also designated Labor Day as a federal holiday in an effort to appease organized labor after the strike.
George F. Johnson, the shoe manufacturer that founded Endicott-Johnson, fared a bit better than the tyrannical head of the Pullman Company. The company faced threats of unionization for the first time at the end of the 1930s, half a century after the American labor movement began. Former worker Elmer Knowles remembered that George F. "went down and he parked his car in the parking lot and he tried to talk to us on the loudspeaker. And I'll never forget … he drove away in tears." When a vote was scheduled for the workers to make a choice of voting for or against unionizing, 80 percent of the workers voted against it, despite the hard times of the Great Depression. When George F. died in 1948, his funeral was held at the local stadium, packed with thousands of his former employees.

Where we are today
The American economic landscape has changed since George F.'s death, and the Endicott-Johnson Corporation has changed along with it. Over the decades, the company cut back more and more departments, until finally it was bought by U.S. Industries and its operations moved to Tennessee. Author of Workers, Managers, and Welfare Capitalism Gerald Zahavi said, "I don't think that workers expect very much from corporations today." The manufacturing industries that have dominated the American economic landscape for generations are laying off thousands of blue collar workers and outsourcing their jobs overseas rather than competing over their loyalty.

In this landscape, the Googles of the world seem too good to be true. However, they are operating under very different circumstances than modern manufacturers. While it makes little sense for the average US employer to invest in company towns and other employee benefits and levers of control, the demand for technical talent in the Bay Area continues to skyrocket. SmartRecruiters expects that computer science-related job openings are expected to grow more than 33 percent by 2020, and salaries reflect that immense demand for these high-skill workers.

These tech companies have simply learned lessons from history. Companies like Google have learned that a secret to playing the competitive recruitment field is to leverage their strength in numbers and logistical talent to offer qualitative benefits beyond just salary to their workers. Onlookers have applauded Google's lavish treatment of its workers, and for good reason. However, it is naive to look at these choices simply as the result of generosity—a quick look at history tells us that well-executed corporate paternalism is also good for the bottom line.

 Why College Campuses Should Allow Concealed Carry


                  Why College Campuses Should Allow Concealed Carry
                  

January 18th, 2013
The news is saturated with stories and opinions on guns, and the attention on the issue is heightened with this past year’s dramatic shootings in Aurora and Newtown. Understandably, the response to these horrors involves great emotion. However, in our dialogue about violence and gun ownership, we need to set aside our fears and biases and look at where the facts lead us. 

Here in the Bay Area, the general response to gun ownership is an automatic "no," and the Stanford campus is no exception. Our campus sees minimal violence and our main exposure to firearms is through the news, where killings are stories rather than the cases with peaceful endings. 

This anti-gun bias is reflected in campus policy and state law. On its website, Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) states that "all [firearms] are prohibited on Stanford Campus … except for sworn police officers," and California has mandated absolute firearm bans on all college campuses. These policies assume that guns are fundamentally harmful. Remembering that a weapon is simply a powerful tool that can be used for self-defense as well as for harm, we need to reconsider Stanford’s "Gun-Free Zone" policy. 
Gun-Free Zones: A monopoly of forceAbsolute bans are ineffective, as criminals carry weapons regardless of their legality. Worse, Gun-Free Zones are uniquely attractive targets, as a monopoly of force is in the hands of whoever is willing to break the law, and police response is often too little and too late. 

When Seung-Hui Cho shot his first two victims at Virginia Tech in 2007, the police unsuccessfully searched for the shooter for two hours. Cho remained in public spaces on campus for that entire time and even went to the post office to mail writings and recordings to NBC News. He then walked to a building of lecture halls at the opposite end of campus, chained the three main entrance doors shut, and killed 30 people in a second attack lasting roughly 10 minutes. 

The rampage ended with Cho’s suicide. With over 200 rounds left, "he was well prepared to continue," said State Police Superintendent William Flaherty. Unarmed, the victims had no hope but to make barricades and wait for the police to arrive, which happened well after the massacre was over. 

The shootings at Columbine and Sandy Hook also ended in the perpetrators’ suicide, not police intervention. According to a U.S. Secret Service study into 37 school shootings, "Over half of the attacks were resolved or ended before law enforcement responded to the scene. In these cases, the attacker was stopped by faculty or fellow students, decided to stop shooting on his own, or killed himself." 

It is wrong to disarm an individual when effective protection cannot be provided in compensation, and relying on police officers and security guards has proven to be insufficient. When targets of violence, people have the right to options beyond waiting for help to come. 
The right tool for the jobIt is generally agreed that self-defense is a valid response to violence. However, when faced with an armed attacker in any situation, fighting back with nothing but your fists is the worst option. Victims need a tool that can level the playing field against all sorts of attackers. 

According to a 1997 study of National Crime Victimization Survey data by PhD criminologist Gary Kleck, "robbery and assault victims who used a gun to resist were less likely to be attacked or to suffer an injury than those who did not resist at all or those who used any other methods of self-protection." The probability of serious injury to a female victim is 2.5 times greater when no resistance is offered and 4 times greater when resistance is offered without a gun. The same study showed similar trends for male victims, though the magnitude of the statistics was diminished. 

As a 5’ 3" girl, I am going to need a better tool than my fists if I get grabbed one night on the way home from my physics lab. Some friends of mine carry mace or Tasers for this very reason. While they are better tools than wrestling, they can be ineffective and even counterproductive. Pepper spray can rebound into its user’s eyes to disable his own along with those of his assailant; one-use only, Tasers are ineffective against more than one assailant and don’t work through thick clothing; and both have a very limited range. 

With the limitations of other options in mind, a concealed handgun is a much more effective tool for self-defense. Along with overcoming the technical weaknesses of pepper spray and Tasers, guns pose a much greater deterrent to criminals. Many incidents involving a victim with a gun end without a single shot. When someone draws a concealed gun in self-defense, the criminal simply retreats 55.5% of the time, according to Kleck. 

Before discussing concealed carry permits, it is crucial that I am clear on what they are and, more importantly, what they are not. Concealed carry permit (CCP) holders are not vigilantes with the duty to protect; in fact, it is strictly against laws and their training. There are consequences for acting unless they themselves are in immediate danger. Extending to campuses, the right to carry would simply allow CCP holders the same abilities and responsibilities they have in most other places. 
More guns, more crime… right?While faculty, staff, and students deserve the same rights to self-defense in their place of work and study as others have, it is an understandable concern that allowing concealed guns would lead to more accidents and crime. Fortunately, this concern has not been realized. 

After a combined total of one hundred semesters, none of the twelve colleges across the country--Colorado State University, Blue Ridge Community College in Virginia, and ten public colleges spanning 30 campus in Utah--that allow licensed individuals to carry on campus has seen a single incident of gun theft, accident, or violence, including threats and suicides. In addition, all Utah educators have been able to carry concealed weapons to work for the past 12 years, in which there have been no accidents or shootings in the schools. 

CCP holders are statistically a very law-abiding group. According to each state’s Department of Public Safety, .007% of Florida CCPs over the last 25 years and .005% of North Carolina CCPs over the last five years were revoked due to a firearm-related crime. The felony rate of CCP holders in North Carolina is .017%, more than 20 times less than the national rate of .35%. 

Not only are people who carry concealed weapons less likely to commit crimes, they can also prevent and stop them from happening. 

In a mass-shooting, the perpetrator is looking to have complete power. "They're the puppet master," said Dr. Mary Ellen O'Toole, a retired FBI profiler. "They've got the control, the power, the weapons." If potential targets are armed, they are far less tantalizing. The Aurora shooter had a choice of seven movie theaters within 20 minutes of his home. The one he ultimately chose wasn’t the closest but rather the only one that that banned concealed handguns. Holmes chose the theater in which his victims were most vulnerable. 

In isolated attacks when the attacker’s motive is a more tangible gain--a mugging, for instance--the possibility of an armed target will cause the attacker to rethink. A wallet is not worth the risk of being shot. 

Beyond preventing these crimes from happening in the first place, there are countless examples of CCP holders ending attacks early and widening the timeframe for escape and police response. Here just a few examples of mass-murders ending early due to armed victims: in 2007, a shooter was stopped by a CCP holder in a Colorado church after killing two people; in April 2012, a knifing spree in a Salt Lake City mall was stopped by a CCP holder when he drew his gun and told the attacker to drop his weapon; and just a few weeks ago in early December, a shooter at a Clackamas mall stopped his spree and killed himself when he saw a 22-year-old CCP holder pull his own gun. Stories of isolated self-defense from the past month alone include: an Ohio gas station clerk shooting a robber; an AutoZone employee scaring off a robber with a gun; and a pastor pulling a gun on a burglar who broke into his church. 

Violence elicits particularly strong fears and emotions. When discussing the role of guns in our society, we need to rein in those fears and emotions, base our decisions

 Re: For the greater good: the game theory of zoning


                  Re: For the greater good: the game theory of zoning
                  

December 30th, 2018
Jake Auchincloss emailed me about my recent post For the greater good: the game theory of zoning and made the constructive point that a homeowner's mindset is "situation-dependent, not ingrained". At the end of the post, I had written that "Individualists and Regionalists are odd bedfellows". Jake pointed out that there may be tension at the abstract level of the Individualist-Localist-Regionalist framework, but that in practice people don't operate at that level. He helped me realize that I'd been getting a bit into the theoretical weeds with that statement, and his dose of on-the-ground experience in Massachusetts reminded me that most of the individuals involved in housing policy don't actually identify by the categories I laid out in the original post; they are simple game theoretic descriptions of different "players" payoffs.

In short, I came to agree with him. The tension I mentioned in that one line is theoretical and rarely bubbles up in practice. These identities don't really describe how most folks on the ground think about themselves. They're useful when thinking about the specific "games" involved in housing policy, but they don't carry over to how people behave in other circumstances.

Here are the relevant excerpts from that email thread...

Jake:Many homeowners are 'individualist' when they want to add an accessory unit and 'localist' when their neighbor does. And because of the fundamental attribution error, homeowners are surprisingly bad at recognizing that disjunction.

On this point:

Individualists and Regionalists are odd bedfellows. In practice they can form a coalition to defeat Localists, but they tend to disagree on other things, and the same power they may muster here to constrain local behavior can also be used in other realms to vanquish other Individualist aims. As a result it can be scary for Individualists to cooperate with Regionalists.

I'm not sure I fully understand and/or am bought in. In my experience, individualists and regionalists are not awkwardly paired. Regional imperatives for more density, as you say, tend to support individuals' aims for highest and best use. So do regional approaches to infrastructure, like water and transportation. I can't really think of examples where that alliance hits the rocks because of different approaches to adjacent issues. 
Devon:... you could imagine that what's best for the region is building a new rail line to stitch together sister cities. For the sake of illustration, imagine that the department of transport owns all of the necessary land in a strip except a single property, and that private owner does not want to sell. The Regionalist would say that it's not only acceptable but right to exercise imminent domain and force a sale; the Individualist would say "hell no", insisting it's their individual right to own property, that it's unacceptable for the state to tell them what to do with their land. You can imagine how this tension could extend to other areas of concern too, beyond just land use and urban planning.

A coalition between Individualists and Regionalists has become increasingly popular as the housing crisis in California becomes more acute. (This may generalize to other places, though I can't speak to those.) This takes the form of state-level legislation that forces the localities to cooperate, and it works pretty well. The problem is that the Individualists may making a pact with the devil, because these actions could set a precedent that state/regional power can overwhelm the choices of communities and the individuals that comprise them for the sake of the greater good. I don't mean to take sides here, because I don't really identify with one camp or the other (or at least I differ from day-to-day!), but I think it's an important tension to note if we want to keep the coalition together. The great fear of the Individualist is that the coalition they currently have with Regionalists could backfire on other aims they have where the Individualist and Regionalist priorities come into conflict (e.g. imminent domain).

A few caveats:Of course precedent may not work this way at all—maybe these issues are sufficiently modularized so that it doesn't change the outcomes of things down the line—but I think that's a gamble that the Individualists in the coalition are taking, and it could blow up on them.Also each of these categories—Individualists, Localists, and Regionalists—are massive simplifications. Each person falls into different camps for different issues, because there are lots of different ways to slice the problem. Many people don't even look at politics through this lens. Some people might use this lens in some cases but not in others.
So sure, on the margins of where most major US cities are at right now, Regionalists and Individualists are well-aligned when it comes to allowing development on individual plots of land. In that case, what's good for the individual landowner is good for the region too, because we need more development. But these goals are not always aligned.
Jake:What I was responding to is not so much the theory you propose about possible tension between regionalists and individualists, but rather whether that tension really does spill over into other issues besides land use. You mention that land use might be sufficiently distinct that the politics is self-contained, and that indeed has been my experience in Massachusetts. Attitude towards development seems to be orthogonal to almost any other issue -- there's no predicting how someone is going to feel about it based on their attitude towards other issues. (I'm sure that's not totally true, but it really does feel that way. Democrat? Republican? Old? Young? Affluent? Well-educated? There just doesn't seem to be a variable that defines a coalition, except of course proximity to a proposed development. Adjacency makes NIMBYs of everyone.)
Devon: You raise a good point that the tension may not spill over into other issues. I tend to approach things from a consistency lens (i.e. if you say you believe X for such and such reason, then that implies you also believe Y), but that's not actually how politics often pans out. Most people are not hardline Individualists or Regionalists or otherwise; more often, the pick the one that matches their interests for a particular issue and/or the aesthetic that they like. So yes I think you're right that in practice this tension doesn't often spill over into other realms, even if logically it "should". (I say that descriptively, not prescriptively.)
Thanks Jake!#game-theory

                  To rent or to sell, that is the question
                  

September 10th, 2023
As a real estate developer, one of the big decisions you need to make is whether you will rent or sell the buildings you've built.

Income from rentals flows in steadily over years, while income from sales hits all at once. This essential difference is simple but has many implications for your risk profile, upside potential, capital requirements, and business model.

The following post is a writeup of my notes as I study real estate development business models. My main goal was to strengthen my own grasp of the tradeoffs, and I figured others might find it interesting too.Advantages of rentals
Rentals are more resilient to market cycles
If a for-rent project is completed in a downturn, the rents it can command may be lower than expected, but the rents can increase later when the market improves down the road, smoothing out the overall return. For-sale properties don't have that same luxury. In a downturn, they may end up selling all of their units at once at lower prices, just to see the market take a turn for the better shortly after they've finished selling their last unit.

Rents may not even go down in the first place – in downturns, people may be more likely to rent than buy, which can actually lead to higher demand for rental units. People are less likely to make a huge purchase like a home when they feel less optimistic about their wallet.

In the cases when rent prices do fluctuate, existing leases provide a buffer against immediate drops. Imagine you own a building with 120 units each. They're on annual leases, and in any given month, about 10 of them are up for lease renewal. If the market goes south, those 10 units may rent at a lower rate, but at least you have the existing leases from the other 110 units that reduce the impact.

Rentals aren't exposed to construction defect lawsuits, unlike condos
In the US, condo developers face a significant risk of being sued by HOAs or individual unit owners for years after a project is complete. (In California for example, the statute of limitations for construction defect claims is 10 years.) This open-ended litigation risk means that developers don't know when they might get pulled into a costly legal battle.

By contrast, developers that build-to-rent don't face this risk, because they remain the owner. This makes the rental business model much more predictable compared to condo sales.

The high risk of post-construction defect lawsuits for condos has remained a major factor depressing that sector of the development industry in the US. Other countries without such extensive legal recourse periods see much stronger condo development as a result.

Rentals provide an income stream
Rental units generate a steady monthly revenue for as long as you own the property, providing a predictable cashflow that can be more sustainable and reliable over the long term. By contrast, sales result in a large lump sum upfront, i.e. one-time income that's exhausted once all units are sold. This can be a pro or a con, depending on your goals and financial capacity.

Rentals align the developer's interests with the long-term
Developers who build-to-rent have more of a vested interest in the long-term health of their projects compared to developers who build-to-sell. It shifts the focus from quick short-term gains ("what flashy features will sell this thing as quickly as possible?") to long-term asset management ("how should I invest upfront to ensure that my tenants are happy long-term and to reduce future maintenance?"). This long-term skin in the game promotes better building quality and maintenance practices.

For example, rooftop pools are a big selling point for many big apartment buildings. However, rooftop pools are a maintenance nightmare and can create major structural issues down the road. As a result, developers who build-to-rent tend to put the pool on a lower level of the building, because even though it makes the building slightly less exciting for prospective residents, it saves the owner a big maintenance bill down the line. By contrast, developers who build-to-sell will often bite the bullet and point the pool on the roof, because by the time the structural damage has taken its toll, the HOA and condo owners will be the ones responsible for it.

Rentals allow developers to benefit from property value appreciation
Long-term ownership allows developers to benefit from property value appreciation over time. This can be an especially valuable in situations where the developer has succeeded at "placemaking", i.e. taking an area and turning it into a salient destination. Placemaking can increase property values in the entire neighborhood, and if the developer is responsible for creating that value, they would like to hold onto the property rather than sell it right upon completion, because it takes time for property values to adjust to reflect the new value.

Disneyland is a classic example. Disney transformed agricultural land in Southern California into one of the most desirable destinations in the world, and in doing so it dramatically raised the value of the land it owns beyond what another buyer would have done. By holding the property long-term rather than selling it after the initial development is done, Disney saw a major increase in the value of this asset.

In fact not only do you want to continue to own your own land in a situation like this, but you also want to own the land around it. Disneyland raised the value of not only the land that the corporation itself owned but also all of the land around it. Famously, one of Walt Disney's greatest regrets was not buying more of the land surrounding Disneyland, because this increase in land value was essentially a huge free gift from the Disney company to the farmers who happened to own the neighboring land.

Long-term holds have much more favorable tax treatment

When properties are built with the intention of immediate sale, they are treated as inventory by the IRS, rather than long-term investments. Any profits generated from inventory sales are subject to short-term capital gains, which can be significantly higher than long-term capital gains. Short-term gains are taxed as normal income at the developer's applicable income tax bracket, which can exceed 30% for high profit margins.

In contrast, profits from properties held over a year before sale qualify for preferential long-term capital gains rates of 15-20% depending on the individual's taxable income level. Holding properties long-term as investment real estate also allows depreciation deductions to be claimed annually to offset rental income and further reduce taxes owed over the investment horizon. 

Additionally, build-to-rent or build-to-hold strategies utilizing long-term financing like loans or syndications benefit from capital gains tax deferral until the asset is liquidated. As long as the loan balance exceeds the property's depreciated tax basis, no capital gains taxes are due, even if the property appreciates significantly in value.

As a result, developers seeking to maximize after-tax returns generally favor business models that are not dependent on immediate sale profit realization.

Advantages of sales
If you can time the market, you can make a killing
Although you can certainly get on the wrong side of a market cycle, you can also get lucky and have your shiny new units hit the market right at the peak of the cycle. When this happens, developers make outsized returns, because they make all of their money in one lump sum, and at a time when the market is willing to pay the most.

You don't need to raise as much equity for the project
Instead of raising as much money from investors, developers can do pre-sales to count towards their equity portion as required by construction lenders. These pre-sales are often 5-10% of the purchase price. This can bring in substantial capital to serve as equity, and it also shows lenders that there is real demand for what the developer is building, which helps them get more comfortable with lending to the project.

States have varying regulations regarding how developers can handle pre-sale deposits from condo buyers. For example, Florida has some of the strictest pre-sale regulations. Developers in Florida must meet certain escrow, reserve funding, and construction completion milestones before they can sell a significant portion of units. By contrast, Texas developers have more flexibility to sell units earlier in the development process before construction milestones are met.

Pre-sales can be a trial balloon before you go all-in
Another advantage of build-to-sell over build-to-rent is that developers can test market demand through pre-sales before committing to construction. With build-to-rent, developers must secure financing upfront to fund the entire project. But with build-to-sell, pre-sales can gauge buyer interest and absorption rates. Developers can decide not to move forward with construction if pre-sales come in below projections. In contrast, with build-to-rent projects, you’re all-in and hoping people rent it once it’s built.

Cash now, instead of cash later
When developers sell homes upon completion of a project, they are able to fully realize the value of that project in one lump sum payment. This sizable infusion of cash can then be used to pay off any construction loans or lines of credit that financed the project. It also frees up capital that can be reinvested immediately into the next development venture. Not having to wait monthly or annually for rental income to be realized can significantly accelerate a developer's cash flow and funding availability for future projects. The ability to swiftly recoup costs and move on to new opportunities is appealing to developers looking to rapidly grow and scale their business through continual development.

This is especially true when interest rates are high, because the opportunity cost of delayed payments increases as interest rates increase. Cash now is worth more than cash in the future, since that money can begin earning interest right away. Loans are also more expensive as interest rates rise, so getting cash from sales now to pay down high-interest debt more quickly is more important than when interest rates are low.

Your development company can grow faster
The lump sum that comes back to you from a sale can be reinvested into new projects, fueling growth and expansion. Instead of waiting years or decades to make up the total amount to then reinvest into new projects, they can scale at a more rapid pace by recycling profits from previous projects into new opportunities sooner.

It's not all-or-nothing
Sell some, rent some
Some developers balance the pros and cons of both business models by mixing the two product types into one project. They'll sometimes sell some units upfront to pay off lenders and investors, and then maintain the rest of the property as rentals to benefit from the stable, long-term income they generate. For example, in Seaside, FL, the developer took this mixed approach. They sold individual lots for homes but deliberately kept the retail spaces and some apartment units as long-term holdings to generate a consistent rental income stream.

However this approach has been used less and less over time for condo buildings. By only holding onto some, the developer is now inserting themselves into a fractured ownership position with the association, which is a management nightmare. Lenders also don’t finance these as favorably because of the fractured ownership structure. (These issues don't apply in the Seaside case, because Seaside's developer was building an entire neighborhood split among different properties, rather than units within a single building.)

Rent now, sell later
Some developers employ a hold strategy where they initially rent out units for some time before selling (typically 5-10 years) to capture appreciation. This allows values to rise as the property establishes itself and units are fully rented (i.e. the property has "stabilized"). After several years of cash flow from rents, the property is then sold at a profit reflecting the increased value.

Cash-out refinance
Another method that developers like to use is the cash-out refinance, because it gives an immediate cash infusion without having to sell the property. A cash-out refinance is when a property owner refinances their existing mortgage with a larger loan. The difference between the original loan amount and the new, larger refinance loan is given to the borrower in cash. This can be a way for a real estate developer to access capital without having to sell a property.

Let's say a developer owns an apartment building currently financed with a $500,000 mortgage. The building is now worth $800,000. Through a cash-out refinance, the developer could take out a new $800,000 loan to pay off the original $500,000 balance and have $300,000 in cash from the refinance. They can reinvest this money back into the property, use it to invest in future projects, or simply take it out as distributions to investors.

The refinance may also come with a lower interest rate, if the building has become more stable and established over time. For example, a brand new building that hasn't leased any units yet will get a higher interest rate than a building that's full of tenants. So even if the value of the building hasn't gone way up, a refinance can still be beneficial for lowering the owner's monthly payments.

Cash-out refinancing may sound like a magical solution where you can eat your cake and have it too, but it has its limits and isn't always an option. For instance, it likely isn't an option if the property's value has declined below the existing loan amount. Lenders want to make sure the new, larger loan is secured by equity in the property. So if a property is worth less than what's currently owed, the lender has no equity to use for a cash-out refinance. Similarly, a refinance may not pencil out if interest rates have shot up, because monthly payments might be more than before even if the property is more stabilized than before. 

A shorthand for thinking about these pros and cons: rentals are generally lower variance, while sales are generally higher variance. They fall into different parts of the risk-reward spectrum.

Depending on your goals, financial capacity, and risk tolerance, rentals and sales each serve different roles in shaping an overall strategy for a development company and its investors.

Every place has some dirty secrets, even Disney World. We all have to get rid of waste somehow!
So in this episode, the Bertauds and I discuss methods of sanitation and waste management from around the world, and how these hidden systems shape our cities.
It also includes one of my favorite stories I've heard from the Alain and Marie-Agnes — but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say it includes appendicitis, a dwindling supply of Novocaine, and a Yemeni surgeon who'd never operated on "a Christian" before.

~ ~ ~

Devon (00:00:12): Welcome to the third episode of the Order Without Design podcast. I'm Devon, and in this series, I get to talk to Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud, the most interesting couple I know. They are experts in urban planning, and they also have the most extensive experience of living in cities all around the world of anyone I've ever met. You can go back to the first episode for a longer introduction to the Bertauds. The topic of our conversation today will be sanitation and public health, and how decisions about this infrastructure shape our cities. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thanks for joining me again. I always look forward to these conversations. Let's get started.

Devon (00:00:49): To me, the smell that characterizes New York City the most is its famous hot sidewalk trash. Disney World, by contrast, has a high tech system of pneumatic tubes that whisk away trash to a central sorting area, so Disney World is a magical land devoid of stinky curbside trash bags and noisy garbage trucks. My question is what stops New York from implementing a system like Disney World?
Alain (00:01:12): I think in Disney World the type of trash which is put in the trash is tightly controlled, not so much by the staff, but by the type of people who go there and what they have to throw out. It's not domestic trash. But by the way, I know two cities which have this system which is operating. One is Barcelona. It's operating only, I think, in one neighborhood, at the East of the Gothic Quarter, and the other city, strangely enough, is in India. It is in Ahmedabad. It is a new business neighborhood where they have implemented that, and I even visited the infrastructure, the detail of the tunnels to see how it works and all that. It is possible. The only thing that I don't have here is how much does it cost per kilo of trash collected, and how often does it break down?
Most of Barcelona is not served by a fancy pneumatic tube system. Most neighborhoods in the Spanish city put their trash outside in large bins, which are more attractive than NYC's street trash but don't smell all that much better.Alain (00:02:03): In Barcelona, the inputs are limited because, obviously, it kind of looks like trash can, but the size is very limited, so you cannot throw, I suppose a sauce pan or a piece of wood or something, such as an old piece of furniture, but that's I think what limit us there. It's an enormous capital cost to start the whole thing. The other thing is I think it would be difficult in New York as I learned recently that there is no map of everything which is underground in the city. I mean, no accurate map. You have a lot of cables and pipes and things like that, which when you dig, you must detect where they are, and it takes a long time. It costs a lot of money. That can explain only partially why the new subway took so long and costed so much.

Devon (00:02:50): Do other cities have maps like that, and is New York sort of special that it doesn't have one?

Alain (00:02:54): Yes. New York is special.
Marie-Agnes (00:02:56): In Australia, they have a very interesting system for the underground system. When we were visiting Sydney in city center, we could see all the cables located in underground tunnel well distinct from one another’s and inserted in tubes. Technicians maintaining the systems have an easy access to their networks making the necessary changes, adding other connections and cables.

Devon (00:03:26): That's really interesting. If I'm hearing right it sounds like the fact that they designed the manholes and the traps so that it was easy to get in and to understand what's going on, it allows for more change in the future and more maintenance?

Alain (00:03:39): Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Yes. Of course, it's extremely well-mapped. This is a very important aspect, the mapping.

Devon (00:03:46): What predicts whether a city will have good mapping and good design to enable maintenance and innovation moving forward compared to something like New York? Why did New York [inaudible 00:03:56] map this way and Sydney end up that way?

Alain (00:03:59): I don't know. I would have thought that probably extreme decentralization of power like you have in the United States do not allow very much standardization of mapping and things like that, but maybe I'm wrong, because Sydney is probably also related to Anglo-Saxon system, so it is not very centralized either. I am not so sure. In France, which is contrary to the United States, a very centralized power. Of course, mapping is a monopoly of the state, and therefore, everything is done according to a National standards... The mayor has very little to do with it. It's done by the central government. They have a mapping agency, and they do all the mapping, including within the city, so they probably oblige the utilities to provide them their drawing to map them. I assume so.

Devon (00:04:48): That's super interesting. One thing that also makes Disneyland and Disney World different from New York or really any of these other cities is that the whole thing is owned by one corporation, and so they're able to internalize all of the externalities, where if you have a more pleasant trash system, if it doesn't smell like trash when you're walking around Disney World, people are going to enjoy their experience there more as well. Do you think that there's anything to learn from that, in the context of cities, or is that something we'll only ever get in a private development?

Alain (00:05:16): No, I think that there is a lot to learn about it. I'm not sure which is a solution, but I think that, as you say, to internalize externalities like that is something very important, and a corporation can do that, because they see it at the bottom line at the end of the year. A city has also a bottom line, but it is less obvious what will be the benefit, let's say, for a New Yorker of not smelling the garbage. Will it have an influence on property values, for instance, or things like that?

Alain (00:05:50): You could study that, but it's not as obvious to measure. For a corporation, of course, they certainly have to do some regulation to find their bottom line at the end of the year is due to smelly trash or something else, but it's still more obvious to them. Probably, there should be some indicators developed in cities which can mimic the bottom line of a private corporation.

Devon (00:06:15): For New York, what do you think is the most likely scenario for... Maybe they're not going to have fancy pneumatic tubes like Disney World, but what would be the best paths forward so the streets stop smelling like trash at 8:00 PM?

Alain (00:06:27): I think there are traditional garbage removal system, which work better than in New York for some reason, and I am not so sure what it is. Again, if we go back to Sydney, the center of Sydney, the density in office building is relatively similar to Manhattan, some part of Manhattan, and you never see the garbage, and you never smell it. The other traditional garbage system with trucks which come and... But they are probably better designed. There is a better system.

Alain (00:06:58): I have seen also city like Seoul, where they have a very strict discipline in putting the garbage in the street and the truck coming. The coincidence between the two is in minutes or maybe 10 minutes maximum, so again, the garbage is collected immediately. It doesn't have time for dogs or even people to look into the garbage and spread it into the street.

Devon (00:07:22): I believe it's Seoul where they have music that plays, right? They play some song, and then it tells people to come out with their trash bags and to put it in the trash. Is that correct?

Alain (00:07:32): I think that's correct. I remember once I was in a small street in Seoul, which appeared to be purely pedestrian, and the street was entirely filled by outdoor restaurant. There was an indoor restaurant, but all of them are on the sidewalk and even on the street they have tables. It was mostly seafood, so the seafood produced a lot of garbage and the very smelly garbage  decomposed very quickly, so they have to remove it quickly.

Alain (00:07:59): While I was sitting there with my friend, suddenly, again, there is a sound, and there is a garbage truck coming. But already before that, the owner of the restaurant knew that the truck was coming exactly at what time by the minute, and he starts pulling the table out backward to let the garbage truck pass, so we have to move, but it was so routine that it was very orderly. There was no panic or anything. Then the garbage truck arrived, loaded stuff, and within a minute, we were back sitting at the same table, in the same place, and the truck has gone further away.

Alain (00:08:37): So that requires, of course, an enormous discipline and also organization. It means that the truck have to come really... if they tell the restaurant, "We are coming at 8:35," it mean that your truck have to come at 8:35. If it comes at 8:50, it's becoming a mess.

Marie-Agnes (00:08:53): The collection of garbage in an apartment building is more complex. Each family is supposed to compress their garbage before throwing them in the dump. The garbage collected by apartment building is at some point controlled for their volume and weight and a charge is applied to the tenants. Maybe this is also a good way to have less voluminous garbage and being more careful separating items before disposing them.

Marie-Agnes (00:09:34): We have also, for example, in France, the triage for selecting garbage. If you live in an apartment or any other places, even in a small town where we go for vacation, you have on the corner of every two or three blocks, different types of containers for disposing the garbage.  Paper, newspapers, glasses and plastics are to be dumped in different binds and you need to separate the organic garbage such as vegetables from the others refusals. The general collection in a village is done once a week.

Devon (00:10:25): I could imagine having that measurement and sort of more of a direct knowledge of where the trash goes and which bin to put it in probably makes you more careful about how much you do, especially if you're paying by the pound, you're going to be sort of incentivized to generate less trash. I've also seen some... I don't remember the details, but there was some study that showed that people who had a meter that showed how much electricity they were using in their house and just counted how much electricity they used, they ended up using significantly less.

Devon (00:10:53): Now, of course, there's probably some confounders there, where if you're the type of person who has a measuring device in your home, you probably are a little bit more sensitive as well, but just having that measure probably makes a significant impact of your perception on the trash and how much you consume of the electricity.

Alain (00:11:08): I'm sure that's a big factor. Yes.

Devon (00:11:10): I know that one big difference between New York City and Chicago is that Chicago's grid was laid out with some alleyways. Whereas, New York City has, I think, only one alley in the entire city, and so in Chicago, they're able to put their trash in alleyways, as opposed to just sitting on the sidewalk. Is that something that once you've designed the grid, you're basically just never going to be able to make that change and New York City is forever stuck not being able to implement the solution that Chicago has done?

Alain (00:11:37): I think, Yes. Once you have divided the limit between private and public, you can never change it, unless you are a dictator, like Napoleon III at the time of Haussmann or Chinese... Now, the Chinese government is doing that in all cities. Suddenly, they're redesigning the entire part of some cities existing thing, but only the Chinese government can do things like that. I cannot imagine in a democracy that it could ever happen."Our son (3 years old) responding to an urgent need in the Toltec ruins of Tula, Mexico in March, 1970. An example of lack of sanitation!"
Devon (00:12:06): Yeah, there's something deeply sad there, where you get stuck in a local optimum, but you can't really go back and change it, because it will ruin people's lives.

Alain (00:12:14): Yeah, it's like the QWERTY keyboard.

Devon (00:12:16): Right. Exactly. Everyone's now learned how to use this keyboard, so you're not going to go replace it, even if there's something more efficient.

Alain (00:12:23): Yeah. The cost will be very high.

Devon (00:12:26): That actually leads me to a whole category of questions about greenfield projects versus brownfield projects. What I mean by that is greenfield being the projects that maybe you're starting a new city in an empty lot or an empty area, and there's no rules, no one really cares, no one has laid claim to it yet, versus brownfield, which is when cities already exist. Maybe it's San Francisco and you're trying to improve bike lanes or something like that. Of course, you just mentioned Baron Haussmann in Paris, and that's the most extreme, or at least one of the most famous examples of someone coming to an existing city and completely changing how the place worked. How do the circumstances of having an existing community change the problem of trying to implement change and implement improved sanitation and infrastructure?

Alain (00:13:13): Ninety-nine percent of the case when you have a problem like that is in an existing city. New cities starting from scratch are very extremely rare. I'm not talking about suburban expansion, because they always rely on existing infrastructure somewhere. But starting cities from scratch, the way the Saudi are doing now, for instance, one or two, is extremely rare. When you have an existing city, you have to deal with the city and their solution, after all. Most of the city we know, whether it's London, Paris, or Rome.

Alain (00:13:45): Rome is exception. Rome had sewers. The sewer, by the way, which was built by the Romans, the Cloaca Maxima. I think it was built in something like 100 BC, the first branch, is still used today. The Romans, by the way, were exceptional in putting infrastructure in cities, including water supply. You still find in area occupied by Rome in France, the [inaudible 00:14:12] Roman area, a relatively small city at the time of the Roman cities, which were about 10,000 people, and they had a very elaborate aqueduct system to bring clean, fresh water to the city, and they had a sewer system. For some reason, this was abandoned in the dark ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire, and it took nearly 1,500 years to put them back the way they were at the time of the Romans.

Devon (00:14:36): These problems are social as much as they are technical. What social solutions did the Romans figure out that we had lost later?

Alain (00:14:44): I don't know why the Romans were so interested in sanitation. Is it that they had some plague in Rome sometime or something like that? I don't know. It seems to be a cultural thing. I remember, for instance, in Morocco, there was a project to build a sewer system without running water. They got water from wells. Every sewer expert say it cannot work, because to have a sewer system, you need a minimum amount of water flowing into it, and if people collected from wells, it would not work.

Alain (00:15:17): It happened that the Moroccans insisted in doing it, and the system worked. It will not work in any other city. It means that the people themselves have such a cleanness, so they, in fact, extracted much more water from the wells, because for their domestic use, they were consuming much more water probably not only for cooking, but certainly for washing, that they made the system work. So, you see, within North Africa, you see a lot of difference in cleanliness of cities, and it's not necessarily related to income. It's related to very old traditions.

Devon (00:15:53): In all of the cities that you've lived over traveled, where did you have to make the biggest adjustments in your standards of sanitation?

Marie-Agnes (00:16:01): In Yemen, because there was no water supply, no sewage, very little electricity, and the roads, most of the roads were not paved, the infrastructure was in fact very limited. For water supply, we did have a  well. Some people would dig next to their well a septic tank supposed to collect the dirty water. So, with the proximity of the two wells, the dirty and clean water will mix after all and you have to carefully to use a filter your drinking water. Even so our water been filtered we will take the precaution to boils it to kill any germs and drinks mainly tea. Concerning the toilets, few houses had flushing toilets and the local people had another ways or go in the field or in the street.

Alain (00:17:08): I think that there they had the traditional system, where the Yemeni, especially in Sana'a, live in towers. They build the higher possible building, and they live only in the second or, third higher floor, so their bathrooms were close to the top, and whether it was... Let's go into the detail.  , what human produced in the toilet would evacuate through a hole in the wall and drip along the façade. There was no  pipes. Only a special shallow grove along the façade. It would drip slowly and most of the time dry-up before reaching the ground. In Sana'a or in Yemen in general, the plateau being fantastically dry, the thing would evaporate before it reaches the ground. The solid things would also dry up and converted into dust and fall in the street, which is probably not very hygienic, but at least you do not have something smelly and gross in the street. I'm sure that this had an impact.

Alain (00:18:03): So, you have a toilet system, which was quite elaborate, but it was based on evaporation, and therefore, on very little consumption of water. They start putting water system when we were there. It as the World Health Organization (WHO) who did it, the WHO that US has canceled its participation in just recently. When they did it, it created a lot of problems, because people start consuming, of course, much  class="transcript-timestamp"more water as soon as they have running water in their house.
"A traditional house in old Sana'a where toilet pipes had been installed just along the area where "things" used to drip."
"Marie-Agnes illustrated how traditional Yemeni bathrooms worked. The water and everything else are evacuated through a hole in the facade and slowly drip in the sun and usually dry before reaching the ground.For rich people who could afford a pump in their well, then a pipe is added to bring the "effluent" directly into the street. The sewers started being built in Sana'a only after we left in July 1973."
Alain (00:18:34): The system was not ready to absorb all this water, so it fell on the streets, which is mostly clay. The clay, when it’s dry, is extremely good foundation for building, very solid, but as soon as it is wet, it is a terrible foundation. So, a lot of buildings start cracking, buildings which were several hundred years old, which had very solid, strong foundation start cracking, because under the foundation, the clay was becoming humid because of the lack of sanitation. Unfortunately, WHO did the water supply before the sanitation. Again here, it was a political decision. Their priority is to get water, not to get sewer, but the more water you consume, the more sewer you need, of course.

Devon (00:19:21): Because you need a place to collect it so that it doesn't just soak into the ground.

"A facade in Sana'a with the water pipes and toilet pipes installed as a faced ornament."
Alain (00:19:25): Right. Yeah. Either it's absorbed by the ground and then it affects foundation, or then it flows on the ground, and this is what's happening in a lot of slums in the world, where the main streets are, in fact, open sewers.

Devon (00:19:38): I imagine that can't be good for the water quality either, right? Because now you no longer have that evaporative effect, where everything just dries up and it doesn't really get mixed in. Now, the solids that come out of the window or whatever, they land in the water.

Alain (00:19:52): Yeah. The wells we had, that Marie-Agnes mentioned, were 30 meters deep. That's nearly 100 feet deep. You see, it was pretty deep, and it was dug by hand, by the way. You have people... It was a job to be a well digger, so they will dig and practically every six months, we will have to call somebody to dig another meter, because the water table was going down constantly. In the beginning of our stay, most people could not afford a pump and used  a rope and a bucket. Suddenly, more people had electric water pumps, which of course, then  consumes much more water.

Alain (00:20:25): So eventually, I think, the water table after we left was lower and lower, and eventually, the municipality start digging very deep wells, but according to the geologists, those wells were, in fact, fossil water. It was water, which was below a layer of volcanic basalt, so this water was, in fact, not renewed. It was not part of a water table. It was just there in the same way as oil or something like that is there underground. It was fossil. The day they consume all this fossil water, it will never be renewed, and they will be completely out of water.

Devon (00:21:03): Will they all just be forced to move?

Alain (00:21:05): Yemen, the plateau has a tail of a monsoon, so they have a wet season that lasts about two months, where you have thunderstorm, but it's very sudden. Unless they have a system to recover all the water which falls without too much evaporation, my guess is that they will never have enough water to support the current population. At the time we were there, the entire population of Yemen was evaluated at five million people. Now, I think it's something like 30 million. That makes a lot of difference. At the time, the consumption of water, of let's say an average Yemeni family, was something like 35 liters per capita per day. Now, for people who can afford water supply, it's probably 130-150 liters per capita per day.

Devon (00:21:56): Wow. So it's really accelerating, and they're going to have to figure something out.

Alain (00:22:00): Just to give you an order of magnitude, in California, a household... I'm not talking here about industrial consumption of water, households consume around 400-600 liters per capita per day. In Europe, the average in cities is around 200-225.

Devon (00:22:18): Why is it so much higher in California than in Europe?

Alain (00:22:21): My guess, I don't know, you wash your car a lot and water your lawn. Maybe you take more showers. I don't know. Or you drink more water and less wine. I don't know.

Devon (00:22:31): That might explain it, especially between the French and the Americans. What was the personal impact on your life of having different access to infrastructure for sanitation and water?

Marie-Agnes (00:22:41): You have to be more careful, and we had two young children at that time, everything was very, very controlled. I would check what they will eat, washing their hands very often, making sure that they didn’t eat anything that falls on the dirt since Veronique, our younger child, was still crawling on the floor.
It’s another story when we were in New York. We were living in an apartment, and some tiles felll around the kitchen sink. Yann, our little boy, only one years old, started to eat these things crawling on the floor. Anyway, they were cockroaches, but he thought it was dry raisins, and he was putting these into his mouth, that was not to be too good. Maybe the cockroach in New York are less dangerous!

Alain (00:23:38): There was a funny story like that. At the time, Marie-Agnes was still learning English, and she didn't know the word cockroach in English, so after those tiles fell off and the floor was full of cockroaches, she immediately went to the drug store, but she looked in the dictionary to find which is the English word for cockroach. In French it's cafard, but cafard has two meaning one is somebody who is sanctimonious,  pretending to be holy but a hypocrite, and the other is a cockroach, which is called cafard, so she look at the word, and she took the first meaning, which was sanctimonious.

Alain (00:24:12): So, she goes to the drug store, and she says, "I have a lot of sanctimonious in my house. Do you have something against them?" And so, the guy says, "Lady, I don't know what you're talking about." After that she came back. When I came back from work, she says, "We must be the only people with cockroaches in New York, because at the drug store, they have never heard of those animals."

Devon (00:24:36): That's hilarious. I remember when we had dinner a while back, you mentioned that you had appendicitis while you were in Sana'a. Can you tell that story?

Alain (00:24:45): Yes. I was working for the UN, and the UN had a doctor in Yemen who was an Italian, who has been disbarred, or would you say a doctor who cannot exert in Italy. He has been literally kicked out of Italy. We didn't exactly know why, but so he exerted only in Yemen, and he was a very nice guy, very learned man, but obviously, medicine was not his forte. He told us also that he had a disgust for blood.

Alain (00:25:12): Suddenly, I had a lot of pain in the bottom of the stomach, and I went to see him, and he say, "Well, you have certainly appendicitis. You need to probably be operated here, because it could become very serious." So he said, "I know only one surgeon which is worth in Sana'a, and he's a Hungarian. He's working in a military hospital. Why don't you go and see him? So, I went to see this Hungarian, and he received me in his bedroom. He had a bedroom in the hospital, and his office was his bedroom. He looked at me, and he said, "Well, it's better to operate right away," so he told me first, "We don't use general anesthesia here, because we tried and we could never wake up the person, so we don't do it anymore." So he say, "With you, we'll have just Novocaine. I'll give you a shot of Novocaine, but it's not very comfortable"

Alain (00:26:04): So we got to the operation room, which was an ordinary room, and for the Yemeni, it was interesting, because they all told me, "This is the first time we operate a Christian" .The Yemeni divide the world into Muslim and Christians, and they thought that maybe the inside of a Christian was different. By the way, the Chinese also, there werecalled Christians and there were a lot of Chinese in Yemen at the time. Quite a number. There was a large Chinese embassy, and they call them Christians, too, which was probably not the case,as it was the time of Mao.

Alain (00:26:34): They knew also that foreigners were a little keener on hygiene than the Yemeni, so during the entire operation, there was somebody was brooming the room saying, "We want to make sure that everything is clean." Basically, it was not really an operation theater. It was a room with a table, and I laid down on the table, and people were holding me. So the surgeon start with his assistant, and they start operation. He told me, "Okay. Novocaine." So he asked his assistance, "Novocaine," and the assistants tell him, "Well, Novocaine, ma fish! There is none." So the surgeon turned to me and say, "Well, I told you local anesthesia, but we are running out of Novocaine, so if you agree, I will do the operation without anything." And what can you say?

Alain (00:27:17): He asked me, "Are you nervous?" And I say, "Well, no. Go ahead." So they proceeded with the operation. I found it very, very painful, and I was glad when it was over, but the advantage of it was I recovered very quickly without anesthesia. Anesthesia is a shock. I recovered very, very quickly. Four or five days later, I drove my Land Rover and things like that. That was okay.

Devon (00:27:42): Oh, my goodness. Marie-Agnes, what did you think of all of that?

Marie-Agnes (00:27:45): Yeah. When the doctor says, "I will operate," and told me, "We cannot let you in," so I'd say, "Okay. Fine." I went back home, gather bed sheets, towel, soap and some changes for Alain, still hoping that he will not stay too long in the hospital. When I was back he was already in his hospital bed. He just stayed there for few hours and we were back home where our environment was cleaner than this poor military hospital. Alain did recovered after few days.

Devon (00:28:41): What was the risk of infection?

Alain (00:28:43): Probably high, but I was lucky. Maybe being born in Marseilles, I have kind of an immunity against infection. I don't know.


"During the war (1942) to avoid the bombing in Marseille, my family moved to the countryside in a tiny hamlet where they rented a house without running water (but a spring nearby) or electricity. My sister Mireille and I, shown on this picture took our bath in a metal tub outside where the water was preliminary warmed by the sun! before winter came, we moved to another much more comfortable house further away in Auvergne, but where the fight between the resistance underground and the Germans was fierce." — Alain
Devon (00:28:51): Wow. What a story.

Alain (00:28:53): When I was born, we were living in the center of the city. We were also filtering water. We had a filter for water. We will not drink the water from the tap. Never. But we were filtering water, because the water was supposed not to be very clean, but my mother was a chemist, insisted that we brush our teeth with unfiltered water. She thought that we would develop an immunity like that by having very small dose of unclean water. I suppose that this probably protected me when I traveled. I'm very, very seldom sick when I travel, and I don't take any precaution. For instance, if I visit the slum and people offer me water, as a matter of principle, I drink it. I don't refuse it. I drink it, because out of courtesy, and I am never sick.

Devon (00:29:39): I went to Bangalore in India about two years ago now, and I walked around the city, as I usually do, and to be honest, I didn't even consider the fact that a lot of people get sick when they go to India, and I just ate all the food off the street. There was this one point where I bought curry in a plastic bag, and I ate it with my hands, and I drank all the water, and I didn't get sick at all. I came back, and I mentioned this to a friend, and he was just like, "What were you thinking? That could've turned out really poorly." Do you think that Americans and Europeans sort of overrate the risks, and that maybe I didn't get so lucky and actually it was fine, or do you think that that was maybe a bad decision and I should've been more careful?

Alain (00:30:17): No, I think that you took the right decision. I think that's American. My experience is that Americans are more sensitive to, let's say, bugs in the water than the Europeans, by the way. I found that in the World Bank  where teams  were multi national, but still dominated by Europeans and Americans, and the Americans get sick much more often than the Europeans. I think that Americans probably live in a much more antiseptic world than the Europeans do.

Devon (00:30:48): When did Marseilles get clean tap water that you didn't have to filter? When did that change?

Alain (00:30:53): I don't know after I left the city. I don't know. Now, they don't have filters, but... No, maybe not. It must be... Yes. When we moved in a new apartment in '47, we didn't have filters, so it was probably in the central neighborhood where we still had bad water, so it was just after the war when we start having clean water, I suppose.

Devon (00:31:15): What usually precipitates a city upgrading its water system so that you don't need a filter anymore? Is there sort of a defining moment?

Alain (00:31:23): Cholera and plague. In Marseilles, we had an epidemy of cholera in the 19th century, I think, the last one, and it significantly improved things. I've seen it relatively recently in a city called Surat, which is an old city in India in Gujarat, and the city was particularly badly managed, and the bank tried to finance water supply and sewage, but the city was so corrupt and badly managed, we could never get a project going. Suddenly, they had a very bad cholera epidemic. The people then became very, very upset with their own municipality, and within two or three years, suddenly, Surat government became one of the most efficient in Gujarat, and they start having a sewer. Now it's a city which is very well-managed and has a good sewer and water system. So it was a cholera epidemic, which I don't remember now how many died there were, but it was like medieval plague at the time.

Devon (00:32:24): Tragically, it often takes a really serious crisis for something like that to change. One of my favorite books is called "The Ghost Map," and it's about London during the 19th century, when they had a massive cholera epidemic. They had also the disadvantage that they didn't know what cholera was. They thought it was just caused by bad smells, as opposed to something in the water itself, but now that we have better understanding of how cholera works, and I guess, by we I mean science knows this, but do you think that the thing that causes cholera in the world still is people not understanding where it comes from, or is it more the corruption and the inability of municipalities to respond effectively?

Alain (00:33:05): I think it's a capital cost. The obvious thing is water supply and sewer, to separate the two. Most people in many cities still now get water from wells, and obviously, when the density gets high, they are prone to get cholera, so you need certainly an enormous investment, a capital investment. That means you cannot do it incrementally really. You have to do a lot right away to build sewers and to build the water plant also to distribute the water. This is an enormous capital cost.

Alain (00:33:38): If you have a city which do not have access to credit, who cannot issues bonds, this is nearly impossible to get all this capital in a few months or in a few years, so it's really this type of problem. That's why in Yemen, this was financed by WHO, the water system first, and later they did the sewer, but after we left. So the WHO provided  the money, and certainly, the Yemeni had to pay some part of it, but probably no more than 10% or 15%. If not, Sana'a would have gone without any sewer system for much more many years without WHO.

Devon (00:34:15): It sounds like the investing in that water supply and also in the sewage was probably the right thing for Sana'a, but they didn't do it in the right order so that they wouldn't create further problems. Would you agree with that, or do you think it would've been better if they had actually just stuck with their more traditional methods?

Alain (00:34:31): No, the more traditional method was incompatible with a higher water consumption. As soon as you have electricity, and by the way, electricity was privately provided in Yemen. Nowadays when electricity come... It was entrepreneur who will have a generator, and they would ask the neighbors, "Do you want to participate?" It will cost that much per kilowatt or something, or you pay a lump sum, and you were connected by this generator.

Alain (00:34:58): As soon as you have that, you have electricity, you can extract water from the ground. You multiply your consumption of water immediately, because you are not limited by the bucket you draw from the ground, especially if the water table is low, like it was in Sana'a, 30 meters. Suddenly, you multiply the consumption of water, and then you need absolutely a sewer system to take care of it.

Alain (00:35:22): Now, it's also this electricity thing increased the difference between poor and rich, because the rich can afford electricity. The poor cannot. So the poor still have a very low water consumption, which probably is not very good either, in terms of personal hygiene, washing clothes, and things like that. Some of my colleagues in Yemen, working for the municipality, were very poor. At that time, I don't think they washed their clothes more than two or three times a year because of the cost of water and soap and things like that. You get a lot of infectious disease because of clothes.

Alain (00:36:00): Some people even think that the improvement of health after the renaissance in Europe was not due to improved sanitation or medicine, but it was due to the emergence of cotton underwear, where people had cotton underwear that they could wash. So that's not eliminated, but decreased very much the amount of parasites which were living in clothes that you never wash.

Devon (00:36:26): I find this also fascinating, because I think when we think of health, you usually think about what kinds of drugs can I take, what kinds of therapies can I have when I have a disease? Certainly, those are incredibly important and have lengthened lives and improved the quality of life, without question, but I think there's this much quieter but possibly more impactful thing, which is public health infrastructure and norms around cleanliness and just knowing... I brush my teeth every night. Most people didn't do that for most of history, I think, and the result is your teeth fall out within a few decades. What sorts of things can a municipality do, besides putting in sewers and sort of the obvious, to push a society towards healthier norms?

Alain (00:37:08): I think that, in a way, I think it's opposite. It's society which evolved and pushed municipality toward healthier norms. I think it has to come from the people. Usually, the elite will try to protect themselves, so their neighbors will be a little better serviced, and then they realize that if they want to manage their health, if half of the city has cholera, and they cannot protect themselves against cholera, even if they have a good sewer system, so they are ready to expend money to expand the sanitation system to their entire city.

Alain (00:37:42): Health is really a collective good. You cannot be healthy in a city where 50% of the people are unhealthy, so it's probably something which is very important. But again, I think it has to come from the people. I don't think that a city itself, just because you have some technocrats who will demonstrate rightfully that a sewer system or a water system will improve the health of the people, that the municipality then will invest the taxpayer money in a sanitation system, unless there's a strong demand already among the people for it.

Devon (00:38:16): A recent example that's quite extreme, of course, is in San Francisco right now, they're responding to COVID by putting homeless people in individual hotel rooms so that they're not interacting with each other and spreading the disease out on the streets. This is something that's been quite controversial, as I understand it, because it's expensive to put people in hotel rooms, but on the other hand is this massive external, where if, let's say we "solve COVID" in the general population, but it's still running rampant in the homeless population, it's only a matter of time before it hops over to the rest of the people as well.

Devon (00:38:51): I don't know about the cost-benefit calculus. Maybe they're putting them in the fanciest hotel in San Francisco. Maybe that's not the right cost-benefit analysis, but I think it points to this problem exactly of, when it comes to health, we're all in it together, and we have to lift everybody else up, because otherwise, you end up getting stuck.

Alain (00:39:11): Right. Yes. Absolutely. This is a very good example of this problem. Health is a public good. You cannot separate it. One illustration of that in this time of COVID-19, Edgar Poe's short story called, if I remember well, "The Masque of the Red Death." It's a story of a bunch of noblemen who try to insulate themselves from the red death. They wall themselves in with a lot of provisions, and they make parties all the time. Suddenly then, the red death appears among them. You cannot protect yourself, even if you are very rich and build walls against bad health.

Alain (00:39:46): This is where the cities intervene. I think the homeless, what you suggest, the example you take here about the homeless in San Francisco is exactly that. People realize that they cannot protect themselves if the homeless remain very vulnerable to the virus.

Devon (00:40:04): At the same time, if it gets bad enough, the super rich will tend to completely opt out of a system. You see this with schools as well, where if a public school system gets bad enough, basically anyone with money will put their children into private school systems, because they just don't want to deal with it. I can't say I blame them. You want to take good care of your children.

Alain (00:40:25): Yeah. It's not the same thing, though. Yes, it's true for of a school system. You can have a two-schools system, but health, you cannot protect yourself. If you have a part of the population which has a contagious disease in a chronic way, you cannot protect yourself, no matter how rich you are. Where, for education, yes, you can have a system of education, which is wonderful, and the other lousy, and in the long run, it will, of course, affect society, because you'll have more criminality and certainly less efficiency, if you have only an elite which is educated and the other which is not.

Alain (00:41:01): But this will be longer run problem. In the short-term, it appears that a very good education for your kid and a lousy education for everybody else is okay, that in the short run it's a benefit, but it's only in the long run that it is not. For health, it's different. I think health, the short run benefit of solving the problem is very clear.

Devon (00:41:22): Right. Because even the richest people it the world can't go enjoy downtown New York City anymore. They're not going to the West Village and watching comedy shows anymore. That's done for everybody.

Alain (00:41:32): Yes. You see, you cannot live only among very rich people. You need people to prepare your food, do things like that, and if they are unhealthy, you are going to be unhealthy yourself, especially... I'll say, there's a difference between infectious disease and chronic disease. If they have a chronic disease, if they have heart condition or a bad liver, it's okay, but if they have an infectious disease, like COVID-19 or cholera or something like that or amoebas, you are going to get it yourself, too.

Marie-Agnes (00:42:02): That was the case with tuberculosis. This sickness was very contagious and we were to isolate the people with tuberculosis, not putting them in a hotel like the homeless, but in sanatorium, a hospital specialized for the care of TB patients.

Devon (00:42:23): How did that turn out? I actually don't know that much about the history of TB.

Alain (00:42:26): In my generation, our generation, I had a lot of friends who had tuberculosis. I had the beginning myself, by the way, but it was cured very quickly. That was the generation who grew up during the war. There was no medicine. There was shortage of food. There was a lot of things. So when you were in high school, if somebody had tuberculosis, the kid would disappear, and they will send him to a sanitarium, usually in the Alps, in the countryside, where they will live among kids who had tuberculosis. They would be completely separated from their parents. It was like a boarding school, and they lived among them.

Alain (00:42:59): When I became a student, then I realized among my friends, there were two or three or four of them who had been in those sanitariums and survived. They were different, by the way, from other kids. They more well-read. They had read more books than we had, because most of the time, they were in a bed with nothing to do in the countryside, so they were reading much more. They were much more intellectual, but you imagine those kids told me that about 50% of their friends will die. On their bed, you see a sheet, and they are gone. So they were very different. I still have kept contact with one of them, actually, that we see from time to time.. This, of course, has completely disappeared from the world, but it existed not so long ago.

Marie-Agnes (00:43:45):    Because of the vaccination.
Alain (00:43:47): Yeah. Vaccination and penicillin. Penicillin was not used yet completely. So that's something maybe we are very old, so we remember this time, but I was struck by that. By the way, the students who were formerly in the sanitarium, their permanent identity... It was on their identity. When we were at university, we had special restaurant for students who had tuberculosis, and they had this special restaurant with better food, because they have been through that. In a way, they were marked for life. We knew about it. Usually, they didn't hide that they had tuberculosis. Actually, they even... I won't say they bragged about it, but they recognized that it gave them a special personality.

Devon (00:44:29): Wow. That's really interesting to hear about the cultural difference. I mean, when I think about children who are growing up right now... You mentioned that your friends who had tuberculosis were generally much better read. We're going through a terrible thing right now, so I want to preface everything that I'm saying with that, that I don't think it's a good thing that COVID-19 exists. I am very interested to see how the children growing up during this period end up turning out differently, because there's a year or two of their life where they don't go to school in the normal, and they maybe are going to be more self-directed in their learning, and they're socialized differently, because they don't get to go to the movies with their friends. How did you feel like the kids who grew up with tuberculosis ended up behaving differently when they were adults?

Alain (00:45:14): Difficult to generalize. I had about four or five of my friends who had tuberculosis when I was a student. Two of them were close friends, so it's difficult for me to generalize. But it has an enormous impact on their life. But it's different, I think, with what is going to happen now. I think that it will have an impact, but completely different, because here, when they had tuberculosis, they were a small group of people, they lived separately from their parents, and many of their close friends would die. They realized they were different from others.

Alain (00:45:41): Now, here it will be everybody. An entire generation will be different. The only thing, maybe, which will make a big difference between them is income. Again, the kids who have access to the internet and have parents who can maybe guide them there, and kids how have no access to the internet and have parents who cannot guide them, and suddenly they are cut out from socializing or anything, I have no idea what the impact could be, but it could be portent, I'm afraid.

Marie-Agnes (00:46:09): This situation will increase the difference between the children belonging to affluent families and the poor children who are left by themselves when parents can hardly provide what they needs for their education such and a computer and access to high speed internet specially when remote learning may be the norm. We will have a lot of problems following the Covid-19 pandemic. We don't know what will be the consequences, but definitely we will see some big changes in our society.

Devon (00:47:08): Yeah. I can imagine being able to send children to school means that every child gets some minimum of attention and some minimum of educational resources, and perhaps, public schools are not the ideal method for teaching people, but at least it's something. Whereas, this is going to increase variance, where I personally had parents who were very interested in my education and gave me a lot of books growing up, and so I think I would've loved staying at home and reading instead of going to school. I think I would've learned more.

Devon (00:47:36): But on the other hand, there are other children in the school that I went to, who their parents were not very interested in their education, or their parents were very busy and couldn't really give them those resources. Yeah. So I don't think they would've necessarily benefited from this at all.

Alain (00:47:52): Yeah, I agree entirely on that. Yeah. I benefited also from parents who were very educated, very attentive to what we were doing, what we were studying. By the way, comic books were forbidden in my home. I read only comic books when I was going to the barbershop. That was the only place where I could read comic books. I didn't like to have my hair cut, but I would go as often as I could just to read comic books.

Devon (00:48:15): Marie-Agnes, you grew up in Tunisia. What was it like if there was ever a medical emergency in your family or someone was feeling sick? What does your family do in those circumstances?

Marie-Agnes (00:48:26): Yes it was a particular situation. My father was working for the French government as an engineer, doing the logistic servicing the boats in the Navy base. We were having access to a well run hospital for the military personnel and the civilians working for the Navy. I was born as my siblings in this hospital and we had no real problems concerning our health, because we had access to the best care. Contrary to the poor Tunisians who were having access only to dispensaries that provided a very minimum medical care. This really made a big difference.

Marie-Agnes (00:49:16): When we moved from Tunisia to Algeria, here the French government was doing much more for the local population, the Algerians. People were more educated. Many of them will speak perfectly French, where in Tunisia, the Tunisians were speaking mainly Arabic. The Algerians have access to decent schools and hospitals. My mother was a nurse at a dispensary caring for the people in a very poor neighborhood. People appreciate very much my mother services as a nurse. Here too we were having access to the best care possible.

D class="transcript-timestamp"evon (00:49:59):  That sounds like a good situation. Yeah.

Marie-Agnes (00:50:01): Yeah.

Devon (00:50:03): To change tack a little bit, I was reading a little bit about the Black Plague earlier today, the Black Death, and how it impacted cities. I'm curious, since you both have a lot of knowledge about history, how did European cities change as a result of the Black Death?

Alain (00:50:18): Well, apparently, according to historians, the Black Death was, in fact, it created the end of feudality, because it created a labor shortage. One of the best books about this period, by the way, is written by an American, the historian Barbara Tuchman. It's called "A Distant Mirror." It's a story of Europe and mostly England and France in the 14th century, so at the time of the plague. It's probably one of the best books about society at the time that I have seen, and probably, if you are interested, I would strongly... Barbara Tuchman, "A Distant Mirror."

Alain (00:50:58): It's based on she has been digging into journals, memories, literature of the time, and it's the most complete description of society reacting to both historical and event, and of course, the plague is one of the big part of it. So yes, it had a very big effect. Because of the time, it's difficult to know for sure what was the effect. I suppose that this idea that it's ended feudality, because suddenly, labor became much more important than anything else, because there was a shortage of labor. It's probably true. I have no idea if this current COVID will have an effect on society like that. I don't know.

Devon (00:51:41): Just the scale of the Black Death is totally mind-boggling. In five years, between 1347 and 1352, the Black Death killed 40% of the population, which I think COVID is not on track to hit 40%, thank God. But it was really interesting, I was reading this paper this morning about how it talked about how in the short term it led to depopulation of cities, but actually, in the longterm, they found that settlements in rural areas that were far away from cities actually ended up seeing much more depopulation, even though they had lower instances of the Black Death.

Devon (00:52:16): They looked into why that was, and the hypothesis is basically that as depopulation occurred throughout the entire continent, people from rural areas saw better opportunities in the cities after the plague ended, so they moved back into the cities when they might not have previously, because the wages were higher. So it actually ended up encouraging mobility and moving people into the cities.

Alain (00:52:38): Yes. I think it's very likely. Don't forget they were serfs, too. At the time of the plague, many farmers were serfs. That means that they could not move from their farm freely. They were not slaves, but they were serfs. They were attached to the land. The way they kept the system in Russia until 1860, I think, where they abolished it, the farmers were attached to the land, so when you bought the land, when a feudal lord bought the land, it came with people, and the land has no value without the people. The labor was very important.

Alain (00:53:14): The plague apparently abolished the system of serfdom. The cities, at least in France, were under the protection of the king against the lord, so a lot of cities in France are still called Villefranche, free city, and because probably many of them were formed at the time of the plague, where serf just evaded the service of the lord and went into cities, where they were protected by the king. Then they will become bourgeois of the city. They will have a job in the city, and their life will not be dependent on some lord.

Alain (00:53:50): But if you look at the Middle East, more than the plague, I think there were two periods where the invasion of Genghis Kahn... That was earlier. That was the 13th century. Genghis Kahn was a nomad, and he has complete contempt for cities, and he destroyed many of the very brilliant civilizations. After that, you had the plague, which also ravaged East Asia and the Middle East, but we don't have so many numbers on it, precisely because Genghis Kahn has destroyed so many things.

Alain (00:54:22): After the plague finished, then you have Tamerlane. Tamerlane was a Turkish Mongol who was also a nomad against cities, and he destroyed Baghdad. He destroyed Aleppo. His goal was not to conquer. He had the contempt for city life. He thought that nomads with herds were the only noble life. So the Middle East and the Far East up to China resisted better, but the country in between China and Europe were completely ravaged by these two warriors.

Alain (00:54:57): What's interesting is that their descendants created dynasties which created cities again. This culture of destroying cities was only the founder of the dynasty. After that, the Timurid, most of India Mughals were, in fact, created by the descendants of Tamerlane, who created a very brilliant urban civilization.

Devon (00:55:17): What you said about the nomads conquering places and trying to impose their way of life, but then ultimately, creating great cities in later generations reminds me of a quote from a book called "Against the Grain," where the quote goes, "You can conquer a kingdom on horseback, but to rule it, you have to dismount."

Alain (00:55:34): Ah. Ah, that's excellent. Yes.

Devon (00:55:37): So they end up turning into city people, too.

Alain (00:55:39): Yes. Yes. Yes. The descendants of Tamerlane who created the dynasty was called the Timurid, and they created the fantastic architecture of Samarkand that is being seen now, so it was inspired by Persian architecture, but they developed their own.

Devon (00:55:54): One public health menace that people know about but I think continually have underrated throughout history is malaria. I'm curious, how has malaria impacted the evolution of cities, and what sorts of solutions have people come up with that try to reduce the impact of malaria?

Alain (00:56:10): Well, less stagnant water. In the south of France, we had malaria up to the end of the 19th century. For instance, at the time where Vincent van Gogh, who waspainting in Arles, there was malaria and all at the time during the 19th century, people going to Rome on the Grand tour were often catching malaria. Malaria was eventually eradicated by drying up marshlands in cities. You still probably had it still in the countryside for some time, but then it disappeared from Europe.

Alain (00:56:46): In the Middle East, you still have it, but it's a much drier... In India, you still have malaria in India, and of course, in Africa, but it's not completely solved yet. In humid countries, it's very difficult to have only dry land.

Marie-Agnes (00:57:03): Yeah, the Gates Foundation have these mosquito nets that they distributed all over in Africa where malaria is current, and just that, sleeping under a mosquito net, makes the malaria almost disappearing and less common in this region of the globe. Now we have drugs, of course, to cure or temporize malaria symptoms.

Alain (00:57:28): Malaria is special as an infection disease, in the sense that the vector is a mosquito, and the mosquito, to propagate malaria, has to bite somebody who has malaria, so if you manage to eradicate malaria once in a population, then that's it, if nobody comes from another area which has malaria. It's a very collective thing.

Alain (00:57:51): I was thinking of the Henry James novel. There is a Henry James novel... I forgot which one... which takes place partly in Rome, and it's a young lady who will catch malaria and die. At the time of Henry James, people thought that it was just a bad air of Rome. They didn't realize it was a mosquito. Around there were a lot of marshlands, which were dried up by Mussolini, by the way.

Devon (00:58:16): Right. Very much like cholera, there is actually some correlation, where things that smell bad tend to also correlate with bad water, or marshland has the standing water, also sort of is bad air, so they're not 100% wrong. There's something there, but the root cause is misunderstood.

Alain (00:58:35): That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

Devon (00:58:36): In the American South, especially during the history of pre-Civil War, when there was still slavery, the classic image of a plantation is of a big, white house up on a hill with a bunch of slaves and workers working in the fields below. I've learned that one of the reasons for that was because they didn't understand exactly where malaria came from, but they did understand that if they were on higher ground that was drier, and usually with a lot of sun, they would have less malaria, which I thought that was just fascinating. For me, that was always just a look, an aesthetic, and I thought that they put their houses up there just because it looks pretty, but no, it was because of malaria.

Alain (00:59:12): Yes. Right. Yes. Yes, of course. Yes.

Devon (00:59:14): How has the architecture in other places that you've been been affected by malaria or any other infectious diseases that people were trying to prevent?

Alain (00:59:22): There was malaria in Yemen in the lowland, the coast of the Red Sea. It was endemic, but I don't see that there was any correlation with the architecture, that there was anything which would prevent people from getting malaria. Where it's endemic too in the south of India, there was a lot of malaria in Tamil Nadu, things like that, but it's a very humid country with a lot of ponds, so it's nearly inevitable that you will have mosquitoes, except probably people develop some kind of immunity, not complete immunity, but a lot of people resist better to malaria than people who come from Europe, for instance, probably.

Devon (01:00:03): I wonder if there's other types of... Immunity may not be the right word, but sort of your body reacts, where I lived in Panama briefly in a rural town, and I noticed that the mosquitoes just loved me. My entire body was covered in mosquito bites. Whereas, the locals, the people that I was living with, had maybe one mosquito bite at a time tops, and I just wondered, is there something about my body and my skin that the mosquitoes like more. The locals would say that I had sangre dulce, which means sweet blood.

Marie-Agnes (01:00:32): It's the same problem with Alain and I. Alain gets rarely a mosquito bite. Once we were camping in Yucatan Mexico, and here for some reason, the mosquitoes are of smaller size. They easily can pass through a mosquito net and as a result the children and I did walkup the next morning all red when Alain has no one bite.

Devon (01:01:02): He just doesn't taste as good, I guess.

Alain (01:01:04): They recognize a guy from Marseille. Stay away from him.

Devon (01:01:09): That's hilarious. I have two last questions before we wrap up. Last night I had a Zoom dinner with a friend who also lives in San Francisco. He lives not too far from me. He made the interesting prediction that San Francisco's already highly concentrated tech culture might become even more concentrated after the pandemic. What he meant by that was that there's sort of two rough groups of people in the tech industry in San Francisco.

Devon (01:01:34): There's one group that cares really deeply about creating new businesses and being on the frontier of technology and social changes, and then there's another group of people who are very talented and skilled, but they're primarily there because there's kind of a gold rush right now, and there's a lot of economic opportunity, but they don't necessarily identify with those of Silicon Valley itself. What he was sort of claiming was that second group doesn't feel quite so tied to the city, and once the economic opportunity and the value of physically being there is not quite so high, they just leave. What do you think of that prediction?

Alain (01:02:09): That's interesting. I never thought of that in that way. Yeah, it's quite possible, actually. There's no doubt that techies attract other techies. Well, you must know that. Yes. I never thought of that, but I think that's quite a possible scenario. Of course, I'm sure something will happen, some change will happen. We really don't know. We can make predictions saying, "I think that." My prediction for cities is that some people will leave, but they will be immediately replaced by others, because the housing stock is still there, the attraction is still there.

Alain (01:02:44): The only worry I have about that is that the attraction of cities like San Francisco or New York is not only that you meet other people who are interested in the same thing as you are, but it's also that they are attractive in terms of a lot of café, restaurants, a lot of meeting place, where you are more able to have this random encounter that you may not find. The social life is very important.

Alain (01:03:09): Now, imagine that because of the hardship of trying to maintain a restaurant or café in New York or San Francisco that most of them close and get out of business before they can recover, and then during two or three years, you have streets boarding up, all these cafes are boarded up, there is nothing there, then suddenly maybe those cities lose a bit of attraction in itself. New York without the café and the commerce and the street can be very dreary, so I wonder...

Alain (01:03:43): My recommendation for the municipality there is to remove all the very complicated zoning requirements. In New York, if you want to convert a small commerce retail shop into a restaurant, you have to have also to... It may take two or three years for the conversion to do it. If you do that, then you will ruin the whole thing. My recommendation is to allow zoning to have the type of zoning that you have in other countries, like in Japan, for instances, where this is any commerce which is not obnoxious... it's not a slaughterhouse or something like that... is allowed by right in a residential area. I think that's what New York should do and San Francisco, too, if they want to survive as an attractive city.

Alain (01:04:31): If you have during four or five years, cities which have no place of social gathering at all, that you have still condemned to meet your friends at home because there is nothing else or at the office, but our zoning law prevents this flexibility at this moment.

Devon (01:04:48): Yeah. Some cities are experimenting with allowing for easier permitting of using sidewalk space and that sort of thing. I wonder, though, what the magnitude of those changes are. I'm seeing all these articles that make me happy of cafes spilling out onto the streets, just like it was so hard to do before, and bike lanes coming out. But how big of an impact actually is that right now?

Alain (01:05:10): I think it will be limited, because in New York, at least, eating outside is fine for about six months of the year, but six months of the year you can't. It's too cold, or it's too warm, or it's snowing. Then to survive, restaurant, it's a very competitive business, and to survive, they have to have the maximum number of clients, and suddenly, you decrease their client by half practically. It's a good idea to liberalize that, but I'm not sure that it will have such a big impact.

Alain (01:05:40): By the way, when we arrived in New York in 1968, there were very, very few restaurants on the sidewalk, very few. I don't even remember any, actually. I was struck by that, compared to Paris, and those restaurants developed in the years after. It's interesting, it was eating on the sidewalk, which is, to me, very attractive, when the weather is good... much more attractive than being inside... is a relatively recently acquisition, I think, in the United States.

Devon (01:06:10): I'm also a bit concerned about small businesses compared to big businesses. It seems like this sort of crisis on relative terms is better for larger businesses that have a lot of capital and money in store, so you might see all of these small businesses fold, and then the big chains can come in and take up the cheaper rents on the big streets. I have sort of a gloomy prediction that we're going to end up in a place where you walk down the street, and instead of seeing a bunch of charming, little local restaurants, you see a Taco Bell and a Chick-Fil-A. While I like my junk food just as much as anybody else, it takes away from the specialness of that particular city, of course, right? You can get a Chick-Fil-A in any state.

Alain (01:06:51): Yeah. I think the beauty of cities, and especially cities like New York or San Francisco, which have a relatively... The private space is divided into relatively small lots, so that allows the small restaurant, which is specialized in something, which does Basque food or something like that, or South Indian, and to survive, because it's a small... they catch it with small clientele, and it's a small thing, and I am afraid, yes, that the chain has a very big advantage. If the scenario you described, which is possible, happens, it will really make those cities much less interesting.

Devon (01:07:31): I guess having those smaller shops, where Tokyo being one of the most extreme examples, where the lots are really tiny, compared to, I'd say, San Francisco has bigger ones versus Austin, Texas, which has huge blocks, would you predict that the cities with the smaller lots will probably maintain small businesses better than the big ones?

Alain (01:07:51): Yes. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. I think the size of the lot has a lot to do with it. Yes. That's one of my critiques with my Chinese colleagues. When they expanded the cities in China, they tended to give one developer a very large chunk of land. The city has a monopoly on land development, but when land is developed... Let's say the basic infrastructure is developed, then they auction the land to a private company, and instead of auctioning land by small lots, they auction them by very large lots, sometimes several blocks at a time to one company, and that, I think, is very detrimental to city life and the diversity we expect of a city.

Alain (01:08:32): One, I think of the major positive side of the grid in Manhattan was the size of the lot which were very small,.  So you can always, if you want to have a department store, you will aggregate those lots, but the unit is a small lot, and that allows a lot of variety and small entrepreneurs to try their luck. It doesn't mean that they will succeed, but eventually, there will be a Darwinian process. The more lots you have, again, if you follow a Darwinian process, the more initiative there will be, and some will be successful. Where, if you have few lots and you end up with a kind of an oligarchy of restaurants or services or commerce, which is not very good.

Devon (01:09:15): Why do the planners in China tend to do bigger lots?

Alain (01:09:19): Because it's convenient. If you auction the lot... Auctioning is a difficult process. You have to follow rules, and it takes time, so it's much easier to auction one square kilometer at one time, and you deal only with one person, than to auction this same one square kilometer, auction to 20,000 people. Twenty-thousand, it will be more difficult, certainly. Yes. But to the detriment, what is difficult is not necessarily bad.

Devon (01:09:50): Right. Just because it's a little bit more difficult for the people making the decision doesn't mean that it's the wrong decision.

Alain (01:09:55): Yeah. And they don't see, where precisely if you see the older parts of the cities in China, the lots are small also, and that's part of their attraction is precisely that, that the lots are small, and therefore, you have this huge variety of commerce and especially restaurants. In China, there are many specialized restaurants and different types of food. That's possible, I think, only if you have small lots. Eventually, you'll have a large restaurant, which will acquire several lots. I'm not against sometimes large restaurants or even chain restaurants, but the unit should be a small.

Devon (01:10:34): I wonder, if it's so much more interesting to have smaller lots, why don't these big developers who get multiple blocks go in and then create multiple smaller shops within that, if it's better?

Alain (01:10:45): Well, it does happen in malls, especially, by the way, California. Usually they have anchors, having larger lot for something like Macy's or Bloomingdale or whatever, but they usually optimize within the mall. But somebody, a developer, was running a mall has a knowledge of what he wants or she wants for the mall, which is different from a developer with very often an intermediary who buy the land, and then will say, well, we will do office building there or we will do housing and try to simplify the operation at maximum, particularly there is a question of cash flow.

Alain (01:11:25): The operator of a mall is conscious that he has to attract people in this mall, customers,. They know that the customers have tastes which are changing, so they try to adapt to those customers. Where, I think that a developer in a large block in China is very often, by the way, it's a financial company. It's not somebody who has any experience in development, where the developer of a mall is very, very experienced in mall development. It's not somebody who's just saying let's do a mall there. They're very specialized. So this lack of knowledge, if it's a financial company, they say, well, we have already two or three takes for office building. Let us build just office building, and shops, in a way, are a hindrance to that. They will complicate things, so I think that's what happened.

Alain (01:12:18): I have seen that also in India, by the way, this thing happen in large developments in India. In Delhi... Sorry. In Mumbai, in the '80s, they developed a new business center, which was extremely well-located in the center relative the city, and unfortunately, they decided that it will be a financial center, and they allow only banks or financial companies to locate there. There was never one... If you wanted to eat there, have lunch, you will have to take a taxi to go outside the zone, or you'll have to send somebody with a taxi to buy sandwiches somewhere else. It is still the case in this area whilein the rest of Mumbai there are a large variety of small shops of all sorts.

Devon (01:13:02): Wow. That doesn't sound like the most pleasant place to work, but then I guess if they measure it by economies of scale and efficiency, it's probably way better on some regards. But then they're not thinking about all of the other pieces that make up a day to day life, like I have to get lunch.

Alain (01:13:17): Well, I think it's a full vision of city. They come with one parameter, which is, yes, financial companies, they do better if they are next to each other. This model of Wall Street. That's fair enough. But they don't realize that you don't optimize a city with just one parameter. There are about at least 100 parameters to take into account. The same way as you could decide a city which would reduce the cost of sewer by 50%, but the sewer system is not the central part of a city. It's a very important, but you don't design a city around the sewer system. It's absurd.

Devon (01:13:53): Right. Yeah. I guess there's a lot of examples of cities that are over-optimized on one thing. The one that urbanists love to rag on, and I'll pile on right now, is when you optimize for through traffic, and you make it so that cars can cut through, it is good to be able to get to places quickly and not... But when it means that highways are now cutting through neighborhoods and making the place unpleasant, sometimes you have over-optimized on that one variable.

Alain (01:14:19): Yes. Yes. That's why you have to keep your eye on markets in the wider terms. Markets is a way to balance all of these things together. That's why, in a way, the development of malls, the inside of malls, and the way land is allocated in a mall between small shop and large shop, restaurants and retail usually reflect the desire of the people. It does really reflect markets.

Devon (01:14:45): I suppose if you have that smaller granularity, then markets can work their magic more. Whereas, if it's at a bigger level, it's harder.

Alain (01:14:52): Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. But that's not due to their design. It's due to retail. The anchors in the malls are usually Macy's, Bloomingdale, or... Those anchors are not doing very good business because of the competition or online shopping.

Marie-Agnes (01:15:11): Yeah, but remember the Singapore mall. There, in Singapore the malls have not only retails, but you find also dental office, notary public, Kidengarden School, dispensary and all sorts of activities. Up to now and in general the concept of a mall in the US is for mainly shopping. You may have food court and some restaurants, but nothing like a real city where you have all sort of business.

Alain (01:15:56): Yeah. But those malls in Singapore are on subway stations, too. They are built around subway stations.

Marie-Agnes (01:16:01): Yeah, but the malls here in the US are on big parking lot, and many are now closing. More may be transformed to accommodate sort of Disney World with skating ring and amusement park like here in New Jersey.

Devon (01:16:30): It's very interesting to see how malls in Asia... The ones I'm thinking of particularly are Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan. Those are the ones I'm familiar with. They have very different malls. Yeah, you got what you're saying, Marie-Agnes. They have a much wider range of activities, and so I imagine that they're a lot less fragile to macroeconomic changes or particular changes in a particular industry, because sure, maybe you're not buying as much clothing in a mall, but if you're still getting your notary signed or you're still getting your teeth cleaned from your dentist, you're going to still keep doing that foot traffic.

Alain (01:17:01): Yes. Yes. I wonder if the zoning in our countries, the zoning is not for something in it. For instance, if a dentist wanted to settle in a mall, whether the zoning rule allow it, I don't know. I'm not so sure.

Devon (01:17:16): The last question I'll ask and then let you get to your dinner is sort of a long one. We'll wrap it up after that. Shelter-in-place reduced the positive impacts of agglomeration, and this reduces the advantage of being in cities in the short term. I'm personally not in San Francisco right now. I'm in a house in the countryside, because my apartment in San Francisco is just one room. That was great when San Francisco was a thriving city where I could go see my friends, I could meet new people in my industry, but right now, I can't do that, so why would I stay in a super expensive apartment and not have a lot of space?

Devon (01:17:50): So that's the downside. But on the other hand, I think there is a silver lining for this, which is that it is creating a more even playing field for people who don't have access to those cities. Like one example is that right now Zoom is the only way that I can interact with friends. The three of us had a video call a few weeks ago, and that was just lovely. We had dinner together. Usually, we would only have dinner if I came and visited you in New York, and sure, Zoom was possible all along, and we easily could've done it, but when it's sort of competing with the people who are physically around you, you're much less likely to do it.

Devon (01:18:23): This is the preface of my question, which is if we're looking at the bright side of this gloomy picture, by reducing the potency of physical agglomeration in cities, what new opportunities does this create for people who don't usually have access to those opportunities, like for jobs and for social? How can we make the most of it?

Alain (01:18:42): It's possible that some of the people who do not have these opportunities have also little access to the internet, in the US at least, so their advantages reduce on that. But I think, too, that what you mentioned, if you go back to San Francisco now, you will have no opportunity to meet your friend in a restaurant, so you may as well be where you are now. This is temporary. I cannot believe that we will not find a solution or even get used to social distance or better hygiene, maybe, inside a restaurant, and that this will resume. I cannot believe that this COVID thing will completely eradicate several thousand years of urban civilization in one go.

Devon (01:19:28): I totally agree. I plan to go back to San Francisco as soon as it's healthy to do so.

Alain (01:19:33): Right. Yes. Yes. As soon as you can resume.

Marie-Agnes (01:19:36): But there is a positive things with Zoom. We are now connected with people that we will hardly have the chance to meet specially with the pandemic. Alain was in conference call with Moscow colleagues this week and with Vancouver. With Zoom we reconnected with my sister and my brother in Paris. We have now more chance to virtually connect with my family than we have before.

Devon (01:20:17): Totally. My job has been remote for a long time, actually. I work at GitHub, which has offices in San Francisco, but employees are all around the world, and most of my team are not based in California. It's actually wonderful in one sense, where the people who use the product that we build are all around the world. I think if my office were purely based in San Francisco and all of my co-workers were there, I would have less of a habit of talking to people all around the world, but because my co-workers are remote, too, I have this habit of using the Zoom call to talk to all sorts of different types of people.

Devon (01:20:53): I've had calls with users who are based in Zambia, in China, in the Netherlands, in New York. The list goes on and on and on. In a way, it has gotten me to think a little bit more broadly, beyond just the place where I live. Whereas, I feel like if my entire social life were entirely rooted in San Francisco, I might only talk to developers and programmers who are from California. I agree.

Devon (01:21:18): I think my most optimistic prediction here is that we have learned through this new tools, and we have new capability to reach new people around the world, and then once we're able to all come back together, we will be even better than we were before. Because now, we can connect with people over really long distances and also see people face to face, so I'm hoping that it brings us together ultimately.

Alain (01:21:40): That is very simple. Before, I was even reluctant to use Skype. I found Skype very often clumsy or didn't get the connection and the image was not good. I found that Zoom works very well every time. I think that the technology has improved, and certainly, Zoom will improve, too, over the years. That will be a positive side. In fact, we may gain by having the two aspects, the opportunity of face to face contact when somebody visits New York, and at the same time, keeping more intimate contact with people in different countries that we will not have met otherwise. That's possible.

Devon (01:22:18): Well, I should let you two get to your dinner. Thank you for taking so much time to talk with me. These are always really fun.

Alain (01:22:23): Thank you. We enjoy it very much.

Marie-Agnes (01:22:25): Thank you.

 Urban sprawl is a tragedy of the commons

                  Urban sprawl is a tragedy of the commons
                  

November 4th, 2021
We tend to choose larger homes than we want our neighbors to choose. The result: sprawling development that doesn't match what people actually want from their communities.

People aim to maximize access and space when deciding where to live.

All things equal, most people like living in places with easy access to their day-to-day life. It's nice to be able to walk your kids to kindergarten, and it's easier to keep a social life when many of your friends live on your same street. When you run out of dish soap, you're grateful that you can resupply at the bodega downstairs rather than having to drive 20 minutes to a supermarket.

All things equal, we also want as much space as possible. We like having space for a gym, a separate bedroom for each kid, and a yard where we can relax when the weather is nice. Space also brings us silence, peace, and privacy. On a 10-acre estate, we don't have to hear our neighbors mow the lawn or hush their baby at 2am, and we don't have nosy neighbors wondering why the milkman is lingering so long inside the house.
High population density increases the quantity (and diversity!) of services a neighborhood can support, but it also requires each residence to occupy less land on average.At the extremes, maximizing access looks like Hong Kong, and maximizing space looks like Wyoming.But there's a fundamental tradeoff between access and space. 

Access to amenities requires a population density that can support those amenities, and space requires... well, it requires space. Clever design can do a lot to reduce this tradeoff, but ultimately more space per person results in fewer people on any given land area.

If we want more amenities closer to us, everything needs to take less space on average. If we want more space, everything needs to be farther away from us on average, reducing our access to those people and services.

Imagine a neighborhood where everyone lives in a 8-story Parisian apartment building. Now, let's move them all to a neighborhood with 1-story single-family homes with 2x the footprint. By an extremely conservative first approximation, everything takes 16x more space, which means points with a similar number of people between them are 4x farther apart. Your friend who lived 15 minutes away now lives 60 minutes away.
So what? Can't we each just decide how we individually want to balance access and space, move to a community that matches those preferences, and be done with it? If you like having ramen shops open at 2am and I like peaceful morning walks where I don't see another soul for hours, you move to Tokyo and I'll move to Maine. What's the problem?

Your neighbors' housing decisions shape the options available to you. 

If you live in a tiny apartment but everyone else chooses a sprawling McMansion, then you get the downsides of a small home with none of the upsides of a vibrant, dense city. 

In the extreme case, if every other human on earth decides that they value a yard more than the ability to walk to work, then all neighborhoods will be suburban. If you want to live in a 5-story walkup with a bodega downstairs within walking distance of your job, you're out of luck—those neighborhoods just don't exist.

(Interestingly, this is asymmetric: if everyone else chooses to live in tiny apartments in a city, you could still go to the countryside and live a rural life far away from them.)

Okay, sure. So what? The scenario where everyone prefers a larger space and gives up access to urban amenities isn't realistic. There are plenty of people who prefer city living. Why not just move to a dense neighborhood filled with those people?

Dense neighborhoods are undersupplied, because urban density is a Tragedy of the Commons. 

While there are some places where enough people have leaned towards density and access over space and privacy, there is more demand for these neighborhoods than there is supply. Part of the reason for this is because urban density behaves like a classic Tragedy of the Commons.

The aggregation of everyone's preference for more space leads to an undersupply of dense urban neighborhoods. This happens even in cases where everyone in the neighborhood wishes it were more dense and urban!

Let's walk through the game theory. You don't control what your neighbors will do, and there's a spectrum from dense to sparse that any given neighborhood has already collectively chosen. To simplify our model, let's treat these as binary options and just look at the extremes on either end of the spectrum, but keep in mind that there are possibilities in the middle too. These are the two simplified possibilities for how your neighbors might behave:Your neighbors all choose to live in small homes that are densely packed with each other, enabling a vibrant urban environment with lots of interesting amenities like parks and restaurants.Your neighbors all live in large homes that span multiple acres, enabling them to have maximum privacy, space, and control within their own domain.
Now imagine you don't have control over which of those two neighborhoods you're house hunting in, but you do have a choice between two options of where you will live in that neighborhood, both of which are within your budget:A tiny apartment, too small to host a dinner party.A luxurious mansion, with plenty of guest bedrooms to host friends.
Everyone I know would choose the luxurious mansion in a heartbeat. Regardless of which path your neighbors take, you're going to do the same thing: you're going to look for the largest, nicest home you can find that falls within your budget. 

This is called a Nash equilibrium, a fancy way of saying that you're going to choose the same strategy regardless of how your neighbors behave around you. If everyone else lives in a small space to maximize the population density of a neighborhood, you can free ride on that and choose a bigger home to get the benefits of both more space and access to the amenities enabled by density.

Let's model this in a game theory matrix:
But if every home in a city was a mansion, it wouldn't be a city anymore; it would be a suburb. 

When one household chooses a larger home, it doesn't have a noticeable effect. But if we apply this logic to every person who lives in a city, the effect is a huge expansion of the city's footprint, pushing the market towards larger homes on average. In turn, this makes neighborhood populations more sparse.

Put another way, each of us tends to choose a larger homes than we want our neighbors to choose. Of course most people can't afford a mansion, but they will always want as much space as they can get. Financial constraints keep this dynamic from spiraling out of control, but at the margin there's constant pressure towards sprawl.

The result: an undersupply of urban neighborhoods.

If every New Yorker lived in an enormous private home like the Cartier Mansion, it wouldn't be a city anymore; it would be a suburb.
The good/bad news is we're far from the efficient frontier of the access vs space tradeoff. 

Most cities currently make terrible use of space, causing people to be more spread out than they need to be, even when taking into account our general preference for more private space. This is bad news to the extent that we're wasting a lot of space unnecessarily right now, but in a way it's also good news: there's plenty for us to do to improve it!
There are so many ways we could increase access to amazing things without sacrificing space. A full list of these ideas warrants a post all of its own, but I'll share three examples that jump to mind:Most cities in the US have parking minimums for buildings, including apartment developments targeting residents who don't own a car. This results in lots of extra parking spaces that spread out our cities and make it harder for us to reach each other. (There are 3.3 spaces per vehicle in LA County, for example.)Many coastal cities put highways right on the waterfront, blocking access to the ocean. This is some of the most coveted real estate in any city, and people in cars barely appreciate the view and ocean air anyways! Instead, make a long thin park along the entire waterfront, and make it the backyard of the first row of buildings. Then, put the first road on inside of that first row of buildings to protect park-goers from the car noise.If we replaced all on-street parking with more spaces in parking garages, we would have a lot more public land on the street. This wouldn't even have to sacrifice the absolute number of parking spaces! Just take advantage of vertical space by stacking them in a parking garage. The street space this saves could be used in so many ways. It could be turned into wider bike lanes, linear parks that line all of our streets with flowers, or literally anything else besides car storage. 
There is so much low-hanging fruit to use the space in our cities better, even before trying to tackle the broader coordination problem. I find it reassuring to know that although this tragedy of the commons will be hard to solve, there's plenty we can do before we have to face that final boss.

What would you add to the list?

Tokyo does not provide public, on-street parking. Drivers are responsible for finding private storage for their cars, just like any other private possession. The result is lovely, and I'd love to see more cities adopt this policy!#cities

                  Book notes — Walkable City
                  

July 29th, 2016

Notes from reading Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time by Jeff Speck.Core argument: A walkable city is not just a nice, idealistic notion. Rather, it is a simple, practical-minded solution to a host of complex problems that we face as a society, problems that daily undermine our nation’s economic competitiveness, public welfare, and environmental sustainability.The American health care crisis is at its heart an urban design crisis. 
    "Doctors focus on remote disease risks, but what really kills us is our built environment." Car fatalities have killed more Americans than all of our wars combined. If we want to save lives, we should be focusing on making our cities more walkable rather than pushing for gun control.For every extra 5 minutes Atlanta residents drove each day, they were 3% more likely to be obese.Commuting ranks as people’s least favorite regular activity. 
    A 23 minute driving commute had the same effect on happiness as a 19% reduction in incomes.Transit lines should only be provided if all of the following conditions can be met: 
    Urbanity: locating all significant stops right in the heart of the action.Clarity: a route with as few diversions as possible expedites travel, limits frustration, and allows riders to form a mental image of the path.Frequency: provide service frequently or not at all; limiting service due to limited ridership is a death spiral.Pleasure: transit is not only a form of public space but also a part of public space. It is important that it is a positive aesthetic addition, not one that detracts from the rest of the space.If we were to reduce parking requirements in major cities, affordable housing would be far more attainable.Metropolitan areas that do not offer walkable urbanism are destined to lose economic development opportunities to those that do. 
    The popular perception of urban living has shifted dramatically in the past generation. TV shows in the 90s were about how the city is an interesting place, whereas in the 70s urban shows were all about crime. This reflects a shift in general cultural impression of what city life is, from a crime-ridden result of decades of white flight to a vibrant concentration of density.The walkable cities mindset has focused on millennials (thinking about how to attract them, that they are our greatest hope for a walkable future, that they are the only malleable cohort willing to reconsider their lifestyle), but in fact we should be thinking about Baby Boomers / empty nesters. 
      "They are fully one-quarter of the population. With the leading edge of the boomers now approaching sixty-five years old, the group is finding that their suburban houses are too big. Their child-rearing days are ending, and all those empty rooms have to be heated, cooled, and cleaned, and the unused backyard maintained. Suburban houses can be socially isolating, especially as aging eyes and slower reflexes make driving everywhere less comfortable. Freedom for many in this generation means living in walkable, accessible communities."To be favored, a walk has to satisfy four main conditions: it must be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting.It makes financial sense to invest in walkability: 
    Walkability correlates with housing values.The classic mantra of "drive until you qualify" doesn’t hold up when transportation costs are factored in.Less driving leads to greater savings, and those savings are certainly going to be spent more locally than they would be buying gas.The Portland Dividend –– Portlanders on average drive 20 percent less than other major metropolitan areas. "Skeptics view biking, transit, density and urban growth boundaries as a kind of virtuous self denial, well meaning but silly and uneconomic. But in reality, being green means Portlanders save a bundle on cars and gas, and local residents have more money to spend on other things they value, which in turn stimulates the local economy. "Transit construction creates more jobs than highways both short term and long term There is an inverse relationship between vehicle miles driven and productivity in a metropolitan area Creative ideas about parking management: 
    In Carmel: instead of requiring parking, businesses are only required to pay for it, which allows for it to be located in the right location and shared. When parking is no longer the exclusive property of an individual business, it becomes much more efficient. A spot that serves an office during the day can serve a restaurant in the evening and a resident at night.California’s Parking Cash Out law requires employers who provide subsidized parking for their employees to offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space.Most cities undervalue the role of spatial definition in urban vitality. 
    All animals seek prospect and refuge. The first allows you to see your prey and predators, while the second allows you to know that your flanks are protected from attack.The "forest edge", the boundary between grassland and forest where both distant views and physical enclosure were present, provided the ideal early habitat for humans."The recollection of the forest edge may explain why architectural elements evocative of this space –– colonnades, loggias, arcades, verandas, porches –– are so appealing and comfortable." ~ Thomas Campanella in Republic of Shade: New England and the American ElmThe need for refuge means that we feel most comfortable in spaces with well-defined edges, and those edges have gone missing. The typical American urban experience is a profound lack of spatial enclosure.Shadow studies should be replaced by shaping studies.A few stand-out quotes from the book:Specialists are the enemy of the city, which is by definition a general enterprise.Transit must be ruthlessly re-conceptualized as a convenience, not just a rescue vehicle. The system needs to focus on those rare opportunities where it can offer a superior experience to driving.American cities require parking and limit density; European ones require density and limit parking.If you get street design right, people will walk in just about any weather. 
    The presence of healthy street trees in Portland adds 15.3M to annual property tax revenues; meanwhile, the city pays 1.28M in planting and maintenance."Vancouver urbanism" shows us one path toward the happy resolution of the war between figural space vs figural object.

 Comparison of text editing methods

                  Comparison of text editing methods
                  

September 1st, 2018
Given how much time I spend producing text, I've spent shockingly little of it considering the tradeoffs of various modes to input it.

I had a vague sense that typing is faster than handwriting and that, despite this fact, I still prefer writing drafts by hand in my notebook. Recording audio notes while walking and using Otter's automatic voice-to-text transcription is fantastic for getting thoughts down in a steady flow, but the result is never something immediately publishable. And Evernote's mobile app is great for typing up quick notes while walking around the city, but it doesn't work so well for long chunks of thoughts and the lag between having an idea and getting the app open is just enough to cause me to lose the thought sometimes.

I haven't been completely mindless, but text input is the vast majority of my work so even a small improvement could yield a significant upgrade. A plane ride's worth of research and reflection seems like a worthy investment.

So what are the key criteria that matter for text input?Speed: I don't want my input device to be the bottleneck (especially important when writing 🖊️)Navigation: Searchable and editable (especially important when programming 👩‍💻)Access: Mobile and easy to alter no matter where you are (especially important for on-the-fly notes 🚶‍♀️)Courtesy: Private, silent, and appropriate (especially important when in a shared environment 🙊)
I'll go through each one a bit of detail, but here is a summary of my takeaways: (Sorry, the table doesn't render great on mobile...)Input modeAverage speed for adultPros and consHandwritingPrinting: 13 wpm, with a range of 5-20 wpm
Cursive: ~17 wpm (about 1/3 faster than print form)✅ Easy to carry around or find a pen+paper almost everywhere 
✅ More appropriate for taking notes in meetings
✅ Doesn't require a charge
❌ Not searchable or easily editable in-place later
❌ Usually requires transcription for publishing purposes, which further reduces the effective rateMobile typingThumbs: 11-15 wpm seems like a standard speed
Swype: Roughly the same as thumbs! The creators claim that a veteran swypist can reach 50 wpm, so perhaps the ceiling is higher✅ Almost constant access to phone 
❌ Uncomfortable
❌ Inappropriate to take notes in meetings, looks like you're just screwing around 
❌ Longer lag time to open apps, etcKeyboard typing40 wpm✅ Easier to refer to notes and online resources (which can be a blessing as much as a curse)
❌ Easier to get distracted by other things going on Speaking (free-form, i.e. not reading from existing text)Audiobooks: 150–160 wpm recommended
Slide presentations: 100–125 wpm recommended ✅ No way to self-censor, which can be especially useful when writing a draft and you just need to get the ideas out
❌ Words more likely to be fillers, less "punch" per word
❌ Hard to navigate and to edit the text
❌ Not appropriate in many shared spaces
❌ Somewhat awkward at firstReadingReading aloud: 184±29 wpm
Silently: <900 wpm due to limitations in the anatomy of the eye❌ Limited usefulness in this context, just including this for reference 
Speed
My first dimension of comparison for various modes was speed, but then I realized that's just one of many tradeoffs, whose relative priority is totally context-dependent. Speed is just the easiest to measure.

So when is speed most important?For me, slow input can be the bottleneck of getting down notes and rough drafts, which can be enough to cause me to lose the thought entirely.It is less of an issue when programing however; the limiting factor is my speed of thinking about the next step for solving the problem and holding all of the state in my head. Fast input is always better than not of course, but it's not so critical here.
Speaking wins by a large margin at a whopping 184 wpm. Typing is in second place at 40 wpm for the average typist. (I'm quite a bit faster—83 wpm—but I doubt you care about my specific stats. To measure your own wpm: livechatinc.com/typing-speed-test.) Handwriting is roughly 13 wpm, just 1/3 the speed of average typing, 1/6 my typing speed, and 1/14 the speed of speaking.

It's worth noting that the speed test is at best a rough proxy of what we actually want. It assesses the speed of transcribing a stream of random words from a screen, which is not the same task as composing text. When you're formulating new ideas, there are a lot more stops and starts that slow down output that have almost nothing to do with the input itself and everything to do with the speed of your thought process. But it does give us a useful point of comparison for where we might experience a choke point, and with handwriting I often feel like I'm running up against my ability to write faster.

Takeaway: When just getting words out or generating content for something like a rough draft, audio notes are the way to go when possible. Typing is also a fine when the environment isn't conducive to voice-to-text, but I should avoid handwriting if I'm going for a brain dump because it's so much slower.

Navigation
Some tasks require more fine-grained control of where you are in a body of text. For these, precise movements are more important than a flow of content generation. This tends to happen when the thing you're working on has a complex, non-linear structure.

So when is navigation most important?Programming is as much about reading and editing text as it is about writing it, so it's important to be able to navigate it fluidly.Writing by comparison is much more linear, so navigation isn't quite so critical. (Again like all of these dimensions it's generally better to have increased ease of navigation than not, but its relative importance is lower.) However once I'm ready to edit a draft I've produced, navigation becomes more important again because I have to peck around and make small insertions and deletions here and there.
Typing with a full keyboard easily wins. I do most of my writing inside of Evernote; while I jot notes on mobile and have gotten into the habit of using voice-to-text to compose drafts, I always move to the Mac app when I'm in editing mode. Mobile editing is a total nightmare, and it's downright unfeasible with an audio note. With a full keyboard shortcuts + a mouse make jumping around incomparably better. That's especially true in code editors, which further optimize for this use case with fancy menus, minimaps, extensible keymaps, and more. I personally use VSCode, which has awesome tooling for skipping around a code base, and it makes me shudder to consider writing code in something that doesn't have those features. But I can't even imagine doing so with voice-to-text, my thumbs on a mobile device, or with handwriting.

Takeaway: Whenever I'm doing something navigation-intensive I should move to my computer, but I can still generate drafts and notes via alternative input modes that do better on other dimensions. For instance I can do an audio note to compose a first draft for a blog post, but then polish it up when I get back at my computer. This isn't exactly new information for me, but I sometimes will lazily edit something on my phone just because it's in reach, but upon reflection I realize I really should just get up and grab my computer.

Access
For creative work you can't really predict or control when you'll have a flash of inspiration, so having convenient methods to jot down thoughts as they come can be the difference between acting on it and losing it.

So when is access most important?You may want to write without being tied to your desk. The downside of mostly working in text is that you find yourself stuck on your butt all day long. I for one do a lot of my thinking while walking, which isn't so amenable to keyboard typing or handwriting. When you need a small form factorSomething that doesn't require a charge can be useful Easy to pull out at a moment's notice, perhaps at a meeting
I've cobbled together a few solutions, but they're each quite context dependent: Voice-to-text and mobile typing work well for when you're walking (and voice-to-text also works when you're biking... don't tell my mother), though it does limit me to more of a content generation mode than an editing/refining one, and I can't code at all from my phone.Handwriting in a notebook checks some of these boxes, but doesn't work so well when you're moving around.A few months ago I got an exercise bike desk, which lets me type while cycling. This is a good win for being more active as I work, but doesn't address the other issues.
This dimension, access, seems to be most at odds with the other priorities, too. It seems like a hard design problem to make something that's both portable and expressive in the way a great desktop code editor is.

I don't have any great takeaways for how I should change my approach here, but I'm all ears if you have better solutions!

Courtesy 
One factor I nearly forgot to take into account but which shapes my choices a lot is courtesy. Voice-to-text has become my new favorite input method, but I rarely use it in certain contexts simply because it's quite annoying to listen to another person speak into their phone in monotone. Similarly, I never take meeting notes on my phone not because it's particularly bad on the other three dimensions—in fact it scores quite well!—but because it inevitably looks like I'm just screwing around with Candy Crush or checking my email, even if I'm completely focused on what my colleagues are saying.

Courtesy generally serves a constraining factor rather than a goal to build towards. One strategy I've developed to make voice-to-text seem less odd to bystanders is to talk into my phone up to my ear as if I were on a call (rather than talking into it like a microphone as most people do with voice-to-text). Somehow the norms for calls are different from those for audio recordings despite being all but indistinguishable to an uninterested onlooker, so this allows me to get away with more audio input than I'd feel polite doing if it were obvious.

Any other criteria you would add? You know where to find me 🙂#productivitiy

February 29th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.

California Forever’s proposal includes 10 Voter Guarantees that go far beyond what typical developers offer. These are structured as legally binding commitments – written into the ballot initiative that is going to voters in November – that tie the growth of the new city to the well-being of Solano's residents.
Solano Jobs Guarantee: "We will bring 15,000 new jobs [...] that pay at least 125% of the average wage. The community won't be able to grow beyond 50,000 residents until we've fulfilled that commitment."Solano Homes for All: "We will provide $400 million [...] to help Solano County residents buy homes in the new community, and to build more affordable homes. If $300 million is allocated to the downpayment assistance, that's enough to provide 6,000 Solano families with $50,000 each towards their downpayment."Solano Scholarships: "We will provide $70 million [...] to help Solano residents pay for college, vocational training, or to start or expand a small business."Green Solano: "We are providing $30 million [...] for protecting open space and natural habitats, improving public parks and trails, and supporting Solano's agriculture economy. "Solano Downtowns: "We'll [...] invest $200 million in renovating or building [...] downtown areas of Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville, and Vallejo."Smart Growth Guarantee: "If our community grows beyond 50,000 residents, all of these financial commitments will continue to scale up in proportion to the growth of our community."Water Guarantee: "Before the first brick is laid, we guarantee to prove our own water availability."Transportation Guarantee: "We'll provide right of way for upgrades to Highways 12 and 113, including the Rio Vista and Dixon bypass, and pay more than our proportionate share of cost to do those upgrades."Schools Guarantee: "We commit to build 100% of our own schools [...] from day one. Our community will still remain in the existing school districts – we just guarantee that we will build new schools by the time the first children move in."Solano Taxpayer Guarantee: "Our project will pay its own way through the tax revenue it generates [...] at no cost to Solano taxpayers."
These are bold guarantees, summing to about $700 million of benefits to Solano residents for every 50,000 residents as the city grows. The Smart Growth Guarantee then says that these investments would scale further with each increment of 50,000 residents.

Some of the community benefits include "funding for protecting open space and natural habitats, improving public parks and trails, and supporting Solano's agriculture economy, including family farms and agricultural workers."To put the scale of these investments into perspective, the entire GDP of Solano County was $35 billion in 2022. This scale of investment flowing into Solano County from the development of this new city will accelerate prosperity for current residents, and that’s even before accounting for all the new business and opportunities that will happen once the residents of the new city move in.
This is an interesting way to align the immediate interests of existing residents with the long-term prosperity of the county and the well-being of future residents who will get to live there if this city is built. Long-term, the benefits of bringing more people and jobs to the county are tremendous: the new city will create a new economic engine for the county, it will bring a higher quality, wider range of services because there will be more customers to serve, and it’ll bring the cost of housing down. But this will take time to bear fruit, because it will take years to build out all the infrastructure before the first residents can move in (although in the meantime it will create lots of jobs in construction!). The guarantees proposed by California Forever address this time gap by accelerating the benefits for existing residents so that they can see some of the created value come back to them sooner.

When I first read about the voter guarantees, the numbers seemed so large as to be a fantasy. However, I think there are a few things going on that make this possible.

With respect to the $200 million for investments in existing downtowns in Solano cities, California Forever has been very clear that these are not grants, they are commercial investments by California Forever. Since almost no development has happened in those downtowns so far (Fairfield and Vallejo have both been trying to attract developers downtown, but so far, that has not worked), it’s likely that developing in those downtowns does not pencil out and is not profitable. But that’s still different to just giving a grant. California Forever is committing here to make investments that others won’t – i.e., they may be expecting to lose money on those investments in order to help revitalize those downtowns – but the buildings they renovate and build will still be worth something, even if less than $200 million.

With respect to the $500 million that is committed to community benefits and grants, this is still a staggering number, but it’s in the same ballpark as other investments that California Forever needs to make to make the project work, like building water and wastewater treatment plans, contributing to improvements to highways, and more. 

What this investment has in common with those infrastructure improvements is likely one of the company’s core insights: as the size of the proposed project increases, the total amount of value created gets big enough to both fund the necessary infrastructure and to deliver benefits to the community that would otherwise never be possible.

Additionally, the proposed initiative will approve the project all at once and create a flexible envelope for development, which is in stark contrast compared to the patchwork of approvals that dominates development patterns right now. This will remove delays and deadweight economic loss that exist in the current process, which will allow the company to use those gains to provide the community with large benefits.

These community benefits are California Forever’s way of committing to making sure that the city benefits existing residents of Solano County as well as the new residents of the city. If crafted correctly, these benefits have the potential to align the interests of the existing residents with the long-term prosperity of the county and region overall, creating a win-win situation for everyone.

September 2nd, 2018
This was originally published in Nov 2015.

When I first stumbled across the streetcar vs bus rapid transit (BRT) debate, I was strongly biased towards streetcars. My opinion was largely shaped by the few weeks I spent in Berlin this past summer. While I was in Germany, I relied most heavily on Berlin's friendly yellow Metrotrams. I really only used the U-bahn and S-bahn when I had to make long, cross-city trips, where the travel time difference was more than 10 or 15 minutes. I used the bus system only once, despite the fact that it was just as extensive as the Metrotram lines.At the time, I naturally gravitated towards the Metrotrams without consciously considering buses, its main substitute. For all obvious intents and purposes, the bus and metro systems are basically equivalent, so it's strange that I used one so heavily while all but ignoring the other. I can think of a few reasons why this might have happened:
As a first-time visitor to the city with a limited grasp of the German language, I liked the sense of direction the fixed tracks offered. When trying to figure out how to get somewhere, it was nice to see the rails trailing through the city, clearly marking the Metrotram's route.Somehow the trams felt more predictable and dependable than the buses. This intuition is wrong, at least in Berlin's case—bus routes as just as well-defined and stable (at least in the short-term), and all transit options in Berlin run almost perfectly on time (yay for German precision, unlike the Catrain, Muni, and BART...). My hypothesis is that this perception is another byproduct of the fixed tracks, because they foster a sense of permanence that boosts the entire system's credibility.I've always associated buses with the sketchiest, most obnoxious transit riders. My main exposure to buses has been riding SF's dingy, smelly cars crushed by mobs of drunk Giants fans and overly talkative tourists. I'm confident in saying that buses have a similar image problem among most middle-class Americans. My stigmatized perception of buses governed my transit decisions, despite the fact that Berlin's buses are actually very clean, and its riders are on the whole very polite.
Upon further reflection, I see that streetcars' advantages (as expressed in a previous post all have one trait in common: they are a product of perception. Meanwhile, buses' advantages are far easier to quantify. As a result, it is easy for BRT advocates to dismiss streetcars' advantages as petty and unimportant.

I have begrudgingly come to agree that BRT is the way forward; streetcars' modest advantages simply cannot justify their cost. However, rather than dismissing them entirely, it is critical that planners incorporate streetcars' advantages into BRT systems. A few ideas for how they could do this:
Make the bus routes clear and permanent feeling. Ideally you have full-on bus "tracks", segregated from the other lanes of traffic, but you could also simply paint bus routes directly onto the streets. This paint would serve the same function as tram rails running through the city, offering a sense of direction and permanence for a fairly low price.Emphasize a clean aesthetic on both the interior and exterior of the buses. Implement a zero-tolerance policy for messes, and design the interior and exterior of the buses with long-term aesthetics in mind.
All forms of public transit—but especially buses—are vulnerable to stigmatization as being dirty and unsafe. Given the sheer volume and diversity of riders, it's easy to descend below a basic level of sanitation, comfort, and even safety. Any public vehicle quickly devolves into a moving trashcan and graffiti canvas without proper custodial attention. (Never use Caltrain's onboard bathrooms towards the end of rush hour. Just don't.) However, this is not inevitable!Immediate cleanup of messes reminiscent of the NYC subway's zero-tolerance policy for graffiti in the mid 80s could minimize broken windows behavior.
Riders take far less care with their messes when a space is already dirty, which means that once a vehicle is gross it often spirals down to the depths of disgust until it is finally cleaned. It's important to keep to cleanliness above that critical threshold to ensure that it doesn't enter that spiral.People are less inclined to use transit if it is dirty. This results in thinning out of riders, leaving the space to sketchier characters. I for one feel much more safer riding public transit alongside a large, diverse group of people rather than in a vehicle that is nearly-empty with the exception of one or two sketchy people. This has a cyclical effect––without a critical mass of reputable-looking individuals, others are less likely to take that form of transit. This leads to a downward spiral of perception as well as actual safety.
Certain materials, colors, and designs are better suited for long-term use. For example, the brushed aluminum seats on the Seoul metro (to the right) are easy to clean and long-lasting, and they're even shiny! Those cars look like they belong in an industrial kitchen, not an urban transit system. In contrast, seats in many American buses are made of much less durable materials. I have a particularly vivid memory of the buses that hauled my elementary school classes off to various field trips. The seats were outfitted with an ugly vinyl that were brittle and cracked, revealing filthy yellow padding below. A simple choice of more durable, attractive materials would have single-handedly improved my childhood impression of mass transit. (Lucky for the school, we were a captive audience.) If the seats had looked more like the radiant blue of the bus seats pictured to the right, I would have seen mass transit as just another way to get around rather than as a stinky death trap.

It's true that none of the benefits of streetcars account for tangible differences. If riders' only goal was to get from point A to point B as fast and cheaply as possible, BRT would categorically sweep streetcars in this debate. However, riders care about more than just speed and cost; their transit decisions are also influenced by comfort and safety, and they are just as much shaped by perception as the actual experience.

Streetcars clearly win on this count—they are just so cute! They harken to an older time, and they feel more permanent and sturdy than buses. These factors do not outweigh the advantages of BRT, but they should not be ignored. The perfect system would incorporate the advantages of both options, and there are easy, low-cost steps that could be taken in that direction.

 City review: A day in Saigon


                  City review: A day in Saigon
                  

March 22nd, 2018
I spent Tuesday, 6 March 2018 in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. I like the city’s pre-war name better (not a political statement—I just think it’s prettier ☺️), so I’ll use that throughout the post. Most of the signs around town used "Saigon" rather than HCMC, and some of the locals I spoke to called it that too, so I think it’s kosher.

As with Beijing, I was also excited for the food, to get a sense of daily life, and of course to build my mental map of the city.

Key takeaways:

Vietnam seems to be positioning itself as a next big market, opening itself up to global business and cooperation in the international market. More interestingly, normal people seemed enthusiastic about this.Vietnam's relationship with China is important to understanding how it sees its history and where it stands in the international community.
Saigon is a great walking city, despite its heat: fine-grained urbanism; delicious and cheap food; interesting, beautiful, and diverse architecture; and narrow, walkable streets.


Reading
Joe Studwell’s How Asia Works offered a useful framework for thinking about Vietnam’s place in the global market. (Thanks to @mengwong for the recommendation.)
In the 1980s and 1990s many in the West came to believe in the myth of an East-Asian economic miracle, with countries seen as not just development prodigies but as a unified bloc, culturally and economically similar, and inexorably on the rise. In How Asia Works, Joe Studwell distills extensive research into the economics of nine countries—Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China—into an accessible, readable narrative that debunks Western misconceptions, shows what really happened in Asia and why, and for once makes clear why some countries have boomed while others have languished.

Something striking was that almost all English-language content I found about the country was about the Vietnam War. Typing "Vietnam" into the Google search bar always auto-suggested appending the word "War" at the end, and almost all of the books Amazon suggests are about that era too. But from talking to people living in Saigon, the war doesn’t seem to be front of mind (or even really back of mind!) as they go through life. Instead, 

I didn’t come across as many great books on Vietnam as I did with China, so if you have recommendations please send them my way!

Saigon at night 
We arrived at around 2am that Tuesday, but the streets were still alive with activity. I was surprised by how active it was, but then realized that in a place with so much tropical heat and humidity it probably makes sense to shift your schedule to take advantage of relatively cooler evenings. (The following nighttime pictures aren’t mine, since I forgot to take any on my way to the hotel… but these will still give a sense of what it was like.) 
An extroverted Vietnam
I got an early start after a brief nap at the hotel, since I knew the tropical heat would be uncomfortable later in the day. Saigon was hot and humid with a high of 30 ℃ (86 ℉), but it wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as I expected. The tree cover and well-aired public spaces made it easy to get around and to rest.

The hotel gave me a first taste of something I noticed throughout the day as well—Vietnam seems to be very outward-focused. It seems to recognize that development over the next few decades is contingent on trading, interacting, and developing positive-sum relationships with the world. Studwell argues that Southeast Asia’s failed states share a common characteristic: they are all  "politically and economically introverted".

In varying degrees, these countries are re-learning the old lesson of pre-1978 China, pre-1989 Soviet Union and pre-1991 India: that if a country does not trade and interact with the world, it is all but impossible to get ahead in the development game.

The Vietnamese seem to have taken this to heart, including individuals on the street and not just the leaders and business people. The people I spoke to were generally very positive towards the outside world. I met up with a friend from Twitter named An Le while in Saigon. I asked him what his attitude towards the country's history with Americans and colonialism was, and he said that he and other Vietnamese don't see the point on dwelling on that. He said, "We just want to move forward and cooperate to make our lives better."

Free markets are more popular in Vietnam than in America


Dawn from the hotel window

The hotel was hosting the uGlobal Investment Immigration Expo. Its Eventbrite description begins with " In light of Vietnam booming as one of the fastest growing markets for high net worth individuals…"
Vox points out, "China and Vietnam are outliers in another way, too: they have an almost unique combination of economic growth mixed with incredible optimism about the future".
The major exception to this extroverted optimism was negativity towards China. Several people brought up the South China Sea dispute with a look of disgust on their face. An was a bit more moderated than some in a message when we were discussing the topic recently:

I have never come to China. I think it's a beautiful country, and one of the most powerful country in the world. Today they can make almost anything. But one thing I don't like China is they have occupied our islands for years, and today they even want more

Some interesting thoughts on the matter from South China Morning Post:
Many people find it surprising that the Vietnamese are more forgiving to the Americans than the Chinese, despite the millions of deaths caused by the Vietnam war…

Recent opinion polls have suggested that the US is the most favoured country of the Vietnamese – and China the least favoured. Last year, a Pew survey found 84 per cent of Vietnamese viewed America favourably, up from 76 per cent in 2014; only 10 per cent of them viewed China favourably, down from 16 per cent…

Apparently, many Vietnamese see the threat from the US as being in the past, and are happy to leave it in the past. But they see the threat from China as being in the here and now. Memories of the brief but bloody border war in 1979 linger – as do memories of China’s seizures of the Paracel and Spratly Islands, which Vietnam claims as its territory.

Many Vietnamese point out the US invasion lasted just two decades, while Vietnam’s tensions with China have persisted for thousands of years, from a millennium of Chinese rule to the confrontations of the past century. Hanoi’s aim may be to leverage the two powers to maintain its non-aligned diplomatic status, but the balance of the scale appears to be tilting towards stronger relations with Washington than with Beijing.

Scooter City
Scooters are by far the dominant mode of transportation in Saigon. If we were to play a word association game and you asked me to name the first word that popped in my head for Vietnam, it would without a doubt be "scooter".

My best guess as to why is that the city is very large (809 sq mi compared to San Francisco’s 47 sq mi) but has no metro system (though one is under construction) while also having low per capita income ($8,000 in 2014), so travelers need personalized transport that is faster than a bike and cheaper than a car.

This isn’t a totally satisfactory answer though, because doesn't explain why scooters are so dominant. Jakarta can be described in similar terms, but the had more diversity in its modes of transport, in particular a slightly more even split of cars to scooters. (Both of these are from direct experience of being on the street—would be curious to see data on the question to see if they match!) Jakarta is quite a bit richer ($17,374 per capita in 2017), so that may explain the higher prevalence of cars.
Uh oh, it looks like your embed code is broken.

Scooters were strewn everywhere on the sidewalks

The future Saigon Metro

Saigon Traffic Rules from Anna Wickham's blog:Just because it looks like there’s no room for you in that lane, doesn’t mean there’s not.There’s no such thing as a one-way road, even if it’s a one-way road. Always look both ways.One inch is a perfectly acceptable following distance between motorbikes, especially during rush hour.It’s always rush hour.No place is sacred for pedestrians.Crossing the road: "Be like a rock in a stream."A red light is just a suggestion that you could stop. If you want.
A fun part of the trip was seeing all of the different modes of transport you can order through Uber. My favorite was trying uberMOTO to ride a scooter around Saigon.

Granular urbanism ♥ 
I loved Saigon’s fine-grained blocks. They gave a lot character to the streets, and there was so much "there" there. Every block had dozens of cafes, restaurants, homes, shops, and more. Some buildings were so narrow I’m not sure how people got furniture to the top floors!

At first I thought these narrow buildings were just a quirk or a consequence of being an older city, but as I went through the day I saw increasingly extreme examples that made me think there must be something else going on.

Some quick googling surfaced an answer—taxes, of course! It turns out that property taxes were (are?) based on the street frontage of a building. Unsurprisingly, this had some unintended effects. Since people were taxed by the width of the front of the building, they minimized that dimension and maximized the other two.

Apparently, this especially apparent in the Old Quarter of Hanoi. Yet another reason to go back to Vietnam for a second trip!A frontage tax in the Netherlands had a similar effect on Dutch canal houses.
I wasn’t able to determine whether these taxes are still in place from my (admittedly quick) research. If not, they’ve undoubtably had a long-lasting effect on the built environment of Vietnam.

The key design challenge is ensuring that the interior receives enough light, despite being surrounded by buildings on all sides by a narrow sliver at the front. Many homes include mini courtyards through the middle of the homes to improve the flow of air and light. These tall, skinny houses with shafts are so common that the Vietnamese have a specific name for them: it’s called "nhà ống", which roughly translates to "tube house".

Modern residences are still shaped by these laws, and the design of these tube houses can be really clever. The house in the pictures below is just 3.5 meters wide!

This one isn’t my photo, but it’s an incredible example of the narrow buildings throughout Vietnamese cities.
If the taxes are no longer around, I suspect consolidation will occur in the future, resulting in a larger average lot size. Economies of scale kick in, especially when private developers have to deal with more regulation and politics.

Food (a.k.a. why I had trouble fitting back onto the plane)
The food was some of my favorite from the entire trip. It’s cheating a bit, because a lot of it was familiar. I grew up eating this food, since my boyfriend in high school was half Vietnamese. His mom always had awesome pho, spring rolls, sweet rice, and more at the house. Needless to say, I hung around their place a lot…

This guy was making some kind of avocado rice mash. Wish I’d asked him about it!
My best food experience was definitely eating pho while looking out onto the Reunification Palace that was built on the site of the previous Palace of the Governor-General. It tasted the same as the dozens of times I'd eaten pho on Castro, but there was something especially great about eating such a familiar food in the place it originated.One question: Why do Vietnamese put so much sugar in their coffee? I noticed this when I lived in Panama too. Is it a tropics thing or just a coincidence?

Walking in Saigon 
It was a hot day but surprisingly pleasant to walk around the city. Saigon is draped in trees, and most of the streets are very human scale. The best part is that it's just so darn colorful! So much to look at on the street, so much stuff going on.


Uh oh, it looks like your embed code is broken.

BRT! Didn’t get a chance to take a ride, unfortunately.
Protected moto lanes. Great infrastructure for scooters! It would also be good for cyclists, I imagine, but I didn’t see any bikes.Saigon may be the most colorful city I’ve ever seen.The old Post Office building. The French colonial architecture was stunning.


Interesting to see references to hippy culture / Vietnam War protests at the Reunification Palace gift shop.


The Reunification Palace (also called the Independence Palace) had super modern architecture.
Saigon felt much more familiar than Beijing. This surprised me, because from afar it seems further from American cities in n-dimensional space of economic/historical measures. Perhaps the reason for this was a history with more French/European/American influence. It also may have been as simple as "I felt more physically comfortable there due to the reasons I noted above", which has less to do with similarity and more to do with comfort. Whatever it was, I generally felt more "at home" in Saigon than I did in China's capital.

An said that Hanoi has more traditional architecture than Saigon. I heard this repeated by several people, and I'm unclear if by traditional they meant French colonial architecture or historically Vietnamese. Either way, I'm now curious to visit Hanoi as well to compare the experience of being in the city.

I primarily stayed in District 1. I would’ve liked to experience more of the other districts, but I didn’t have particular destinations in mind and didn’t have a ton of time. Curious to compare notes with people who have spent more time outside of District 1!

=== epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing.html === Epistemic statuses are lazy, and that is a good thing


 Epistemic statuses are lazy, and that is a good thing


                  Epistemic statuses are lazy, and that is a good thing
                  

October 5th, 2018
Epistemic status: High confidence about my own experience, mid-high confidence that it generalizes to others'. 
Epistemic effort: Low-to-medium effort. It's a concept I've had in my head for a while, then I did a stream-of-consciousness oral draft with Otter.ai, and then I then read it over once for minor editing.
I have received a lot of positive feedback for noting my epistemic status and effort at the top of my posts. This is hilarious, because I originally started using these as a hack in order to publish half-baked ideas that I'd otherwise not feel comfortable sharing. 

That said, I do think it is an epistemically honest and useful practice. It’s also in that weird category of "this one easy trick" to become a more prolific writer. It is a useful tool to indicate how much mental effort I put into something and how confident I am about it, but it's origin is not something worthy of praise.

A few years ago I wrote a piece about Singapore claiming that totalitarian governments at a very small scale may actually make sense. It was well-written and researched, but I was also very unsure of the ultimate claim. I could make just as many good arguments in the opposite direction, and my intuition pointed the opposite direction. So it sat in my folder for years, because I didn't feel comfortable publishing something that I wasn't very confident about. 

In March it came up again in a conversation with a friend. He asked what I had done with the piece, and I explained that my epistemic status was much lower than I was comfortable with. That lit a lightbulb in my head. I felt fine sharing the concept in the context of the conversation because I could clarify my lack of confidence in the claim. But of course there was nothing stopping me from doing exactly the same thing on my own blog! Why not just state that in my written piece as well?!

I’d seen people use epistemic statuses in other places too, and in those cases I thought it was a great idea, though for more virtuous reasons. It hadn't struck me that it could be (ab)used for this purpose, too.

Since then, I've used epistemic statuses in most of my blog posts, and I've come to appreciate other secondary effects, too:Different types of thoughts require different levels of quality of writing, yet I used to feel obliged to ensure anything I ever published was top notch. This piece, for instance, is not my best writing, but that's okay because I'm just trying to get ideas out on the page. I could make it much better for sure, but the diminishing returns are real. By stating my epistemic effort at the top, I can get away with even more of that tradeoff. 🤓Epistemic statuses are a useful tool for showing the process of thinking, the steps you took to get to a conclusion, rather than just the conclusion itself. This has a few benefits: (1) readers can trace more of your thought, and if they disagree with you it's more likely to surface the specific crux of your disagreement rather than muddling it as one big issue, (2) readers can better understand how deep you've gone with something so as to not be indignant about "obvious" gaps you should've filled, and (3) it can help them understand how your beliefs/actions would be different if just one link in the chain of reasoning were different. In short it builds more empathy between the reader and author, enabling a more reasonable and civil discussion.They allow people to explore concepts that are a little odd without having to stake their identity to that idea. I suspect there are a lot of ideas that people aren't comfortable stating that are actually really useful to contributions to the overall intellectual discussion at hand. It's a tool for saying "Hey guys what if this were true? Maybe we should consider this idea" without having to go entirely out on a limb and insist that it's true. Mainstream publishing tends towards an identity-oriented model of ownership, in which publishing something means that you you stand by it 100%. People attacking the piece are also attacking you. I'd like people to treat publishing more as an exploration than a battle; we don't have all the right answers, and that's okay! It's healthy to share what knowledge you have and especially to point out the gaps. That's how we fill them in. In a more binary world, where you either believe something and write about it or you don't, discovering new evidence contrary to your stance can amount to an attack on your own identity. An epistemic status offers dignity to recognition that you might be wrong.
Epistemic statuses are a fairly blunt tool still, and they do not solve all epistemological problems. (That can be the topic of another post...) However, they are a step in the right direction to make it more clear what it is you actually mean and believe. An added perk: it will allow you to be more prolific with just one easy trick!

 Special snowflakes and canonical examples


                  Special snowflakes and canonical examples
                  

February 9th, 2018
I’m proud to be a beginner! But when it comes to the concrete steps of learning something new, I often feel undue shame about my approach.

At first, I thought it was a fear of not knowing things or, more likely, a fear of other people seeing of me as a beginner. This doesn’t add up though. I don’t hesitate to ask questions when I’m stuck, and I pride myself on my love of picking up new skills and learning new things. In fact, going from zero to some knowledge on a topic is one of my favorite feelings. 

However, I’m always a little ashamed to follow the canonical beginner resources for a topic. I don’t think this is a healthy mindset and try to overcome it as much as possible, but it’s interesting to consider where it comes from.

When I was learning about how to build basic decentralized Ethereum-based apps, I realized what my hangup is: it’s a hipster impulse, a special snowflake syndrome. I realized this because I ran into a bug my Solidity contract, and I used Github’s search to find another person who had followed the same Truffle tutorial. I pasted in the exact line of code from the tutorial and gasped in horror to discover that there were hundreds of repositories with not only that exact line but the entire identical file. Upon quick reflection, I realized my horror was not that it was a basic tutorial, but rather that I was following along with the same thing that so many others were doing. 

This is something I want to quash in myself as much as possible. In this particular instance, the tutorial I was working through was fantastic. It covered all of the key topics I would need in my upcoming project with exactly the right level of rigor. And it was only because it was such a popular starting point for other beginners that I could look up how people solved the problem I was having in the first place. 

It makes sense to gravitate towards the most well-known resources for a subject, especially early on in the learning process. For example:
When you first pick up Lisp, it makes sense to build a little interpreter, because it really does get to the core of the most powerful concepts. When diving into urban design, it make sense to read Jane Jacobs—whether you agree with her views or not, they’re going to set the stage for a lot of conversations down the road. An intuitive understanding of how she fits into the world is key for participating in those conversations. When you first start playing the guitar, it’s a good move to learn a C scale and the four chords that make up almost every pop song, because you’re destined to want to be able to play something recognizable when your friends bully you into performing for them.When you learn Redux, it’s great to build yourself a little connected Counter component, because it illustrates the core ideas of the state container in a minimal example. When you start programming, it’s great to start with Hello World, because it’s something everyone can understand, and it’ll definitely be referenced later on.These are key building blocks as you learn intermediate and advanced concepts later on. They’re canonical for a reason—they encapsulate critical concepts/patterns—and more importantly, they’re shared experiences by the broader community. It’s powerful that people have pointers in their mind that they can use as primitives for describing other things. They build a shared vocabulary that allows the community to collaborate effectively.*

Does anyone else feel this way when learning something new? And is there some reason I’m not thinking of that would support the impulse to branch out to less canonical examples early on?* Of course it’s also not something to take to an extreme—it’s healthy to have some diversity in the way people learn things, because that probably also leads to a broader diversity of approaches to solving problems—but when you’re first entering a new field it’s invaluable.

                  A day in Singapore, Part I: Urban identity
                  

April 19th, 2018
Epistemic status: My personal impressions from wandering the city for a day. Very likely that I'm missing important nuance in lots of places. If you notice a gap, please let me know! I'm so curious to learn more about Singapore. This is more of a diary entry than a worldview. Not sure how to put a confidence interval on that. 🙂 

Epistemic effort: I jotted down notes throughout the day in the city and wrote up this post without lots of editing on an airplane without internet or patience. Not going for a Pulitzer—again, think of this as a diary entry rather than an essay.

I spent Wednesday, 7 March 2018 in Singapore. I may have only spent 24 hours in the city state, but Singapore warrants more than just one post. It's the place by which I've been most fascinated for years, and the day I spent wandering the tropical metropolis sparked yet another obsession with the city that's consumed me since then. As with Beijing and Saigon, I was excited to build my mental map of the city.

The focus of this post is Singaporeans' unparalleled level of civic engagement, which is what struck me most while I was there. In the car ride into downtown from the airport, I wondered aloud if we were on LKY’s famous airport boulevard. I was amazed when the driver jumped into the conversation to say we were not on that route—I thought that the story about the airport boulevard was just a bit of urbanist nerd trivia. Nope! He knew exactly what I was talking about. This was the first hint of just how in-touch Singaporeans are with their urban infrastructure, governance, and history.

The Singapore City Gallery

This impression was immediately emphasized again at my first destination, the Singapore City Gallery at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). It showcases the past, present, and future of Singapore’s urban planning. Even more striking than the exhibit itself is its central location. It’s right in the heart of the city next to Maxwell’s, the famous hawker center that is a major tourist destination as well as where lots of workers in the city's central business district grab their daily lunch. Few cities have permanent exhibits focused on urban planning let alone locate them in such a prominent location. (In fact I can’t name another city or country has a permanent exhibit telling story of its land use over time.) I expected to trek somewhere tucked somewhere out of the way to get to the gallery, but instead it was located in one of the most well-traveled parts of the city. In fact it was so centrally located that actually stumbled across the URA before the time I'd planned to do so in my itinerary. 

Admission was free, and several student groups were on tour while I was there. This history and expertise is clearly important to Singaporeans. This may not be mirrored in democratic representation or empowerment though. It feels more like a really weird, nerdy version of propaganda. Curious to hear locals' perspectives on this. If that's an accurate assessment, I can’t say I’m complaining though, as it results in arguably the highest-quality technocracy the world has ever seen.The URA exhibit had two awesome scaled models of the city. I'm not sure if they're terribly useful, but they are beautiful and immensely detailed. I bet Kids love them too, which is a good enough reason to have them on its own. You can see one of the student groups (all in adorable yellow) in the background of the fourth picture here!

Interesting constraints on Singapore’s land-use policy I hadn’t considered:

There was a lot more to the gallery than what I captured in photos here. I highly recommend a visit! 

Thanks to Steve Waldman for the awesome URA recommendation! Another recommendation of his that I wish I'd had a chance to see is high on my list for next time:
I’d also like to visit some of the very creative high-density housing structures there, such as (upscale, privately developed) The Interlace [theinterlace.com] and the public Pinnacle @ Duxton [pinnacleduxton.com.sg].

Later that day, I overheard a conversation between two girls who were picking up Ofo bikes. They looked to be about 15 years old, and they were discussing the effect that bike share will have on mobility in Singapore in the long-term. Maybe I just happened to come across some NUMTOTs, but more likely this random sampling was yet another indication of how ingrained an appreciation for urbanism is in Singapore's psyche. I can't imagine teens in California having that kind of conversation!

Transit networks

The city was also covered in what could only be called infrastructure propaganda. Every second advertisement on the side of the road was something about the SG’s Land Transport Authority’s plans or successes around expanding transportation. I'm not complaining! Transit propaganda is the best kind. But it was weird.

 The advertisements' optimism was accurate, too. All of the modes of transit I took (the metro, a train, and several buses) ran on schedule, were clean, and came at frequent intervals. The metro system was particularly impressive, with some of the best wayfinding I've ever seen. Singapore is a very multicultural and international place, and they did a great job of incorporating several different languages while maintaining simple signage. 

However I must say I was similarly impressed by wayfinding when I traveled to Berlin and Zurich a few years ago. Since then I've done more transit tourism—experiences in China, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and more — and I'm no longer impressed. I now realize that these are not anomalies, that it's not that difficult to get wayfinding right, but rather that San Francisco is just uniquely bad at it.

The pedestrian experience 

I generally love walking around cities, but I'm not a fan of heat and humidity, so I was dreading the tropical weather. Singapore far exceeded my expectations here. The pedestrian experience around the city was fantastic. Despite it being a rainy day, I was comfortable walking everywhere. I managed to do so without getting wet, because the pathways are covered continuously. I imagine on a hot day they're a nice shield from the sun, too.

The heart of the city, near URA and Chinatown, was preserved with many of the original colonial buildings and narrower, human-scale streets. This was my favorite part of the city. It also felt very layered, with little alcoves and charming passageways.

Outside of the old colonial core, the city had more of a towers-in-the-park feel, though quite tastefully done, and still with a focus on pedestrians rather than cars for the most part. It felt surprising like Vancouver. A tropical, more assertive Vancouver.
Appreciation of good urbanism and good governance 

Another fun fact I learned that day when I met up with my friend Visakan for coffee was that Singaporean students learn about the world history of city states in primary school. They spend time studying Venice in particular. I shouldn't have found this so surprising—the historic parallels are obvious in retrospect. It had a strategic harbor that positioned Venetians well for international trade; much of the land was reclaimed from the sea; it was run like a corporation; and it was a small set of islands that had to defend themselves from unstable, aggressive neighbors. The list goes on I'm sure, but I'll leave it there. I find it fascinating to learn about the history curriculum from other places. It tells you so much about what the country values, how it sees itself, how it intends to mold its identity. I now want to get my hands on the standard reading lists for Singaporean schools...

Overall, I was blown away by how central and present urban policy is in daily Singaporean life. Systems thinking pervades the nation to an extent I’ve never seen before. The only place I've seen that comes close is Switzerland, but even the Swiss seem to have more of a set-it-and-forget it mentality—the systems there work so well that they don’t have to think about them. Singapore functions extremely well too, but somehow the mentality remains very active and constantly looking for places to improve. It feels like very much a Jeff Bezos sort of "always day one" mindset.

A few years ago, Tyler Cowen noted, "The citizens and leadership of Singapore have an unparalleled knowledge and understanding of economics, engineering, and public policy. In this regard the polity is distinguished in world-historic terms, and anyone who visits is enjoying a remarkable privilege to see this in action." When I first read this, I thought it was likely a bit overblown, more a result of the image Singapore broadcasts to the world as a sort of advertising, or at least that it's not something that would be evident just from walking around the city without some sort of inside access to someone in the know. But now that I've visited the city state, this quote is spot on. Every person I interacted with in my (admittedly short) time in Singapore was exceptionally knowledge about how the place worked, about the country's history, and about nuanced tradeoffs ranging from transportation infrastructure to monetary policy to the philosophy of free speech. Even the most educated people I know in San Francisco rarely have that level of knowledge or appreciation about the built environment and governance around them. Tyler also described that there's arguably a "brain drain" into the government, and that this is probably the only place in the world this is true. This seems like a better problem than the inverse.#travel

 Pomodoro

                  Pomodoro
                  

August 3rd, 2015

I love the feeling of flow, when I settle into my work and make steady, ruthless progress without distraction. Unfortunately, getting myself into this state is difficult. It usually happens when I am wearing my noise-cancelling headphones and I am at just at that point where my work is challenging but manageable and my mind is fully engaged but not overwhelmed. It also helps to have a bit of time pressure or a due date on the horizon.

These circumstances aren't always easy to replicate, particularly when I'm working on a personal project where there is no external force pushing me along. Without a sense of urgency, it's extremely rare for me to get into a flow that can't be interrupted by a facebook message, chocolate cravings, an incoming email, or remembering to get laundry out of the dryer.I've experimented with many strategies to combat this flow problem. To ease my perfectionist tendencies while writing rough drafts, I built a tiny text editor called Zen Writer which disables the delete button, among a few other focus-oriented features. I use the Self Control app to block distracting websites, and I write out my goals whenever I sit down to get a chunk of work done to ensure I'm making the most out of my time. I continually tweak my text editor and terminal settings (though that may be more of a distraction than a productivity boost). However, these are relatively small in scope, so they've been met with only limited success. 
The single most effective strategy I've discovered is the pomodoro technique. I've probably gotten more productivity gains from pomodoro alone than all of the other tools combined. The idea is to alternate 25-minute spurts of work and brief 5-minute breaks, and then after every fourth repetition you take a 15-minute break. You promise yourself to be totally focused during the work periods and totally disengaged from it during the breaks. Some people are extremely strict with the length of these periods. When I am strict I find that I can just chug through my work, but it takes a lot of discipline to do this. I'll be the first to admit that I don't always adhere to it perfectly. Even though I was really quite bad at the technique when I started using the it, my productivity immediately increased, and as I've become better at working with this strategy my output has continued to increase along with it.

Benefits of pomodoro
Activation Energy
Pomodoro works well for me is because it's so easy to mentally commit yourself to "just 25 minutes". It can be difficult to initially convince myself to settle down to work on a side project after a long day at work, even though it is something I really enjoy and want to do. My solution is to commit to just one pomodoro, and then after that if I'm still very tired I will let myself relax. But almost invariably that first pomodoro jump-starts me and gets me pumped up to work for hours. Activation energy is hard to come by, but pomodoros make it easy.

Always begin in the middle
The hardest part of any task is getting started. I always used to partition work according to my to-do list, giving myself a break only after checking off an item. I have some minor anxiety associated with starting a new task and re-creating a whole new flow, so the result was that I was always tempted to stretch out my breaks. Pomodoro offers a counterintutive solution to this problem: no matter where you are in your work, stop after 25 minutes. Then after your 5-minute break you just pick up where you left off, and if you finish that task before your next 25 minutes are up then you begin a new one. This can be immensely helpful. You rarely have to start a new project right after a break. Instead, you start right in the middle. You can leverage the win from finishing the last task to propel yourself into outlining and executing the next one.

Easily trackable progress
I'm very strict with my 25-minute stretches of work. If I get distracted for more than even a minute during one pomodoro, I cancel the entire thing and force myself to take a break. This motivates me to blast through those last few minutes with complete focus rather than allow my mind wander off. As a result, when I look at my daily pomodoro count, I know that I can add up those 25-minute periods to get a real sense of how much hardcore work time I've put in

Required breaks pull me away from my work
Strict adherence to stopping for breaks sounds counterproductive. It's true that it sometimes forces me stop in the middle of a deep flow or while solving a really difficult problem. Initially, I was afraid that I would lose everything in my mental cache when I got up for my coffee break. However, over time I realized that – so long as I kept to the short 5-minute break – it actually got me really excited to get back to my work. Rather than another hour's slog I have to get through, work became a reward for strictly following my schedule.

Reminder to relax and move as well as to focus
Pomodoro solves my most chronic issue – mustering the discipline to intensely focus on my work. It also helps with another, opposite problem – remembering to step away from my desk to move and relax my eyes every once in a while. When I'm immersed in my work, I can forget to eat and stretch. In the short term this is fine and actually more productive, but after hours of working like this it really hurts my productivity. Pomodoros force me to take those breaks before I really need them so my mind is always fresh and I'm always high energy.
An added bonus is that pomodoros force me to recognize and pause when I've spent more than 25 minutes working to solve a particular problem. This provides two benefits: (a) during my break I can reconsider my approach to see if there's some better way I should tackle the problem, and (b) it gives me a natural opportuntiy to let my mind rest. Surprisingly often, I find that when I come back to my computer my subconscious has solved the problem for me.

Tips
As I've used pomodoro over the past few months, I've picked up some tricks for maximizing its benefit:Take notes. It can be difficult to remember where to pick up after a break, especially after the 15-minute chunk. To remedy this issue, I make sure to spend the first 20 seconds of my break scribbling down my thoughts from the last sprint so that it's fresh in my mind for the next one. As an added benefit, it forces me to crystallize my thoughts and look at my project on a higher level. If you've ever heard of the term "rubber duckying", the embarrassing phenomenon of figuring out the solution as soon as you start explaining a bug in your code to a coworker, you know that it can be immensely helpful to get away from your text editor for a little while and explain things aloud. Simply writing out problems can have a similar effect, and it can even help you recognize problems in advance before you learn about them the hard way.Work with a friend. Pomodoros are especially effective if you do them with a friend. The slight social pressure makes it embarrassing to get distracted during the work periods, and it's more fun to relax with someone you like rather than alone during the breaks. This is especially helpful when you first start using pomodoros and getting into the swing of things.Use an app to track your pomodoro cycles. My personal favorite is an OSX app called Pomodoro One, but there are tons of apps on various platforms that are also very good.
Pomodoros have been immensely helpful in increasing my productivity and quality of work. It's easier to grasp complexity when you're fully focused, and it makes work more fun, too. Let me know what you think of pomodoro! I'd love to hear how other people use it and other strategies to hone their work.

Zoning, occupational licensing, and immigration are all the same problem, just in different forms. They all reduce individuals' ability to move to the places with the greatest opportunity, and a few concentrated interests are overrepresented, trouncing the broader social interest.
In the case of zoning, NIMBYs constrain the potential of a neighborhood or region for the sake of their own stability, comfort, and home values. Future residents are not represented in these decisions but do bear the externalities of their outcomes.In the case of licensing, professional societies act as gatekeepers to hold down the supply so that it can't fully meet demand.In the case of immigration, workers threaten by an influx of low-wage competition and people uncomfortable with cultural mixing restrict access to opportunity to immigrants whose welfare would be massively improved if the restrictions were lifted.
To be clear, in each case it's not just a question of benefits to that individual who wants to participate but is currently barred from doing so. They'd also be able to contribute more to the rest of society.

It’s all a big cooperation problem, an issue of local interests overwhelming global welfare.

 Singapore: Sovereign City


                  Singapore: Sovereign City
                  

March 7th, 2018
Epistemic status: Highly uncertain, asserted with ~40% confidence. Low enough that I didn’t publish this piece when I originally wrote it in May of 2016. But a recent first trip to Singapore reaffirmed the intuitions in here. Even if the argument is wrong, I think it’s wrong in interesting ways, and I want to start a conversation about it. Plus, since originally drafting this essay I now have the concept of "epistemic status" in my toolset (h/t Scott who got it from Gwern who got it from Muflax), so this seems like a great time to use it.
Despite seemingly insurmountable challenges, Singapore has flourished over the last 50 years. Many countries look to Singapore as an alternative model to western-style governance, and even more import experiments after they have been tested in Singapore’s "sandbox". However, the international community has largely overlooked a key lesson from Singapore’s meteoric rise: its form as a city-state.

Few expected Singapore to survive when it became an independent country in 1965. It was a tiny, impoverished island with a diverse population of recent immigrants. They had little shared history and no natural resources. Singapore had been colonized, occupied, and abused for over a century, and it was surrounded by hostile nations in a region succumbing to pressure by Communist forces.*
Despite these seemingly insurmountable challenges, Singapore has flourished over the last 50 years. Here are just a few measures of the city-state’s success:Singapore’s per capita GDP has skyrocketed from less than $500 in 1964 to over $52,960. Starting at a similar level as Mexico and South Africa, Singapore’s per capita GDP is now third highest among nations worldwide.  Unemployment is below 2%. 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes, the fourth highest rate internationally. In contrast, the American homeownership rate is 63.5%. Singapore is ranked as Asia’s most environmentally sustainable city. The city-state’s crime and corruption levels are consistently almost the lowest in the world. Singapore modernized without imposing "Western political models on Asian realities". In light of these dazzling achievements, many countries look to Singapore as a model of governance and a source of urban innovation. Singapore’s example has been particularly influential in China. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore who governed the city-state for the first three decades of its independence, is sometimes called "the father of modern China". Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who led his country through market-economy reforms after Mao’s death, took direct inspiration from LKY’s blend of authoritarian governance and liberal economic policies. Deng saw the Singapore Model as proof that a country could modernize without surrendering to "wholesale Westernization". Thousands of Chinese officials are sent to Singapore each year to learn from the city-state’s experience, and, after being anointed in 2010 as China's next leader, one of the first things that Xi Jinping was drop in on Lee Kuan Yew.
"If I had only Shanghai, I too might be able to change Shanghai as quickly," Deng once complained, reflecting upon Singapore’s meteoric rise. "But I have the whole of China!" In this comment, Deng got to the heart of  key lesson from the Singapore experiment: Singapore’s form as a city-state was critical to its success.

Lack of resources was a blessing in disguise
At first, Singapore’s small size was considered a major disadvantage. The city-state imported all of its food, energy, and fresh water, and the surrounding region was embroiled in ethnic conflict, nationalist fervor, and Communist insurgencies. However, Singapore’s lack of resources proved to be a blessing in disguise. Its reliance on the outside world forced the country to think in terms of a global network. To survive, it had to focus on being a valuable, stable trade partner. Many other newly-independent nations turn inward, focusing on ideological conflict rather than economic progress. Self-sufficient countries do not thrive under these conditions, but neither do they collapse (not immediately, at least). The consequences are much more immediate for a nation like Singapore that depends on trade for survival.
Singapore’s geometry superimposed over the San Francisco Bay Area. Singapore is tiny!
It was clear from the beginning that economic relationships were Singapore’s only asset. The British East India Company had chosen Singapore as a trading post because it had a sheltered deepwater port, and it was perfectly situated along busy shipping routes that connect Europe to China. After independence, the small country took advantage of its strategic location, positioning itself as stable trading partner and an international center for commerce. This was particularly valuable given the instability of its neighbors. In a volatile but fertile, populous, and productive region of the world, Singapore was a sanctuary for Western business executives.
Singapore’s dearth of resources also allowed it to sidestep the resource curse, the paradox that countries rich in natural resources tend to experience conflicts over extraction and allocation. Countries in which commodity exports comprise a large portion of GDP are far more likely to experience armed conflict. (According to The World Bank, a country in which commodity exports comprise 5% of GDP has a 6% risk of conflict; meanwhile, the chance of conflict rises to 33% when exports are 25% of GDP.) As as a result, these countries tend to undergo economic stagnation and social unrest. In contrast, Singapore focused its energies on value creation rather than value extraction, because there were no natural resources over which to fight.
The city-state prioritized infrastructure from the very beginning to underscore its function as a sanctuary. When it was still struggling to make ends meet in the 1970s, Singapore upgraded its airport to be a world-class transportation hub, recognizing that it served as both a functional connection to the outside world and a symbol of the nation’s desire to join the international community. This costly investment extended past the airport terminal to every detail that foreigners might seen during their travels through Singapore. The immigration counter is exactingly efficient, and the roads leading from the airport to the business district of the city are meticulously maintained and lined with shrubbery. LKY once said:I thought the best way to convince them was to ensure that the roads from the airport to their hotel and to my office were neat and spruce, lined with trees and shrubs. . . . Without a word being said, they would know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable, a people who would learn the skills they require soon enough.
The city-state also emphasized "soft" infrastructure. Sound fiscal and monetary policies ensured macroeconomic stability, and the government has run budget surpluses almost every year for the past five decades. It set competitively low taxes for pioneer industries, while heavy investment in education combined with zero tolerance for corruption and crime made the island even more attractive to businesses. This focus on stability, business conditions, and human capital underpinned investor confidence, which in turn improved the prosperity of the country. Today, the World Bank ranks Singapore as the "best country in which to do business", and the city-state has held that title for over a decade.

Singapore's small size enabled it to reap the benefits of authoritarianism while avoiding the worst of its costs
LKY is often called a "benevolent dictator" or, less generously, a "ruthless tyrant" for his autocratic style of governance. Lee’s party, the People’s Action Party (PAP), has remained in power almost completely unopposed for the past five decades. His country is infamous for its harsh punishments, media regulation and occasional censorship, and a parliamentary system in which it has proved curiously difficult for the opposition to do well. The country’s record on LGBT rights is particularly dismaying, and its punishments for drug-related offenses are extremely harsh.
I am opposed to many of these features of Singaporean society. I am unconvinced that these human rights violations were ever important building blocks for Singapore's social cohesion, and it at least seems clear that the city-state has now reached a level of stability where the government can safely loosen its iron grip on social life.
However, for all of its flaws, it is impossible to argue that this "soft" authoritarianism hasn’t produced results. Singapore’s prosperous if constrained society has achieved both a far higher quality of life and higher degree of freedom than many of its peers who took a more democratic approach.
The continuity of single-party dominance has major advantages over a more disjointed system. Many Singaporeans argue that they have the "perfect compromise between accountability and efficiency". Their democratic elections ensure politicians are on track, but they can "take the long view" rather than capitulate to short-term interests because they know they are likely to win. "Our strength is that we are able to think strategically and look ahead," said Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore’s current prime minister. "If the government changed every five years it would be harder."
Singapore is infamously strict when it comes to public behavior.
Singapore's small size enabled it to reap the benefits of authoritarianism while avoiding the some of its costs. Its autocratic governance is tempered by the fact that the country is a tiny city-state, interconnected with the rest of the world. If its citizens are unhappy, it is relatively easy for them to leave for one of its neighbors. By contrast, if a citizen of a much larger state—say Mexico or Germany or even a large sub-federal entity like California—is unhappy with the system, (s)he would have to move much farther to escape the clutches of that unsatisfactory government.
Singapore’s dependence on trade also makes it far less likely that excessive abuse of its citizens would occur in the first place. Its citizens have economic and personal ties stretching all around the globe. If Singapore were to stop being such a benevolent dictatorship in favor of a more violent, repressive approach, the international community would have incredible leverage over forcing the government to change, because the island is wholly reliant on relationships with the outside world.
Beyond that, Singapore’s success rests upon its populace being healthy, well-educated, and trustful of the government. "Even the most cynical assessment of Singapore involves the government taking enough care of the populace to keep making money from it," said my friend Visakan who lives in Singapore. "For Singapore Inc to make more money, citizens need to be educated and skilled, so repression will never reach resource-curse levels."
Finally, it’s important to consider Singapore’s politics from the perspective of its small geographical scope. Singaporean elections seem shockingly uncompetitive when measured against other democratic nations. However, the nation is as much a city as it is a country, and in cities one-party rule is the norm, not the exception. Singapore’s Law Minister K. Shanmugam noted that "cities like Chicago, San Fransisco, and New York City … have enduring one-party rule", though they are also unquestionably democratic. A single party has dominated elections in each these cities for decades because its policies reflected the needs and preferences of that population, not because it has coerced the populace to support it.

An urban sandbox
Singapore’s small size makes it remarkably maneuverable. It has the sovereignty of an independent country, so it is free to determine its own destiny. At the same time, it is manageably small; its local scope makes it easier for leaders to understand and respond to the needs of their citizens. The government also doesn’t have to make as many compromises, because it is much easier to reach a consensus within a small group than in a larger, more disparate society.
The government’s single-minded focus on economic development could not have been achieved without a large degree of autonomy early on. In the Singaporean system, leaders can act boldly and take risks for the benefit of the society rather than pandering to special interests for the sake of re-election. For example, Singapore was the first place in the world to implement congestion pricing, and it has one of the highest rates of infrastructure investment in the developed world. The government’s autonomy allows it to take this long term view and make unpopular choices that are best for the city state as a whole rather than shortsighted special interests.
Singaporean citizens have steadily gained political power over time, but the government’s ability to act decisively remains one of the city-state’s most important assets. The country recently announced a comprehensive Smart Nation initiative, "the most extensive effort to collect data on daily living ever attempted in a city". In typical Singaporean fashion, the initiative is focusing on building smart infrastructure rather than specific one-off projects, recognizing that many potential applications may not be known until the system is fully implemented. An article from the Wall Street Journal imagined that the data produced by these systems might for example enable the government "to predict … how infectious diseases might spread or how crowds could react to an explosion in a shopping mall".
The city-state has been able to commit to this "whole-of-nation journey" because it has the maneuverability to guarantee the infrastructure, legislation, funding, and holistic vision necessary for this rally the relevant stakeholders. The entire nation—the government, the private sector, and the individual citizens—has bought into this effort in a way that a larger country could not.
Singapore recognizes that its pioneering smart city initiatives will have impact far beyond just the shores of its tiny island nation. Its Smart Nation: Singapore announcement website explains that "such solutions are essential not just for Singapore but the entire world" and that "global trends indicate two-thirds of the world will have migrated into cities by 2050".
The city-state has also positioned itself as an innovative hub for financial technology (fintech). It overhauled and streamlined its regulatory framework in order to attract entrepreneurs, and it has opened a "sandbox" to enable fintech startups to test unproven products in a more flexible, forgiving environment.
"If any one of you has an idea, or a product, or a service, which makes life better for citizens: come to Singapore," said Singaporean foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan. "Prove it, test it, prototype it, upscale it. If your solution works, we will buy it from you."
Singapore has a real competitive advantage here; its maneuverability enables it to make bold changes to the ecosystem, and its small scope minimizes the potential for causing damage to the wider international economy. By contrast, larger systems like here in the US are far more entrenched, because the sheer size of the American financial system makes it hard to quickly change the direction of its momentum, and the risk of doing so is far greater. Singapore’s ability to act as a fintech sandbox is particularly valuable within this particular industry. So many budding fintech entrepreneurs are forced to abandon their plans due to the high regulatory burden most developed countries place on the financial sector. Singapore is unique in both providing room for experimentation as well as having a developed, prosperous economy. Very few countries can check both of these boxes. Singapore’s openness gives it a distinct advantage, one that would not have been possible if Singapore were a much larger country.

What should we learn from Singapore?
By serving as a sandbox for new ideas about governance, Singapore has had a global impact disproportionate to its size. It has exported novel approaches to nation-building, and it continues to work at the cutting-edge of social innovation. However, we have all but missed an important lesson—the city as an autonomous political unit is a powerful force.
Large states have lost control over their destiny to a terrifying extent. The United States has a level of complexity and patchwork of needs that cannot be adequately addressed at the tier of government that is currently responsible for them. And unfortunately the US’s challenges are the rule rather than the exception among nations of its size. Instead, countries should vest far more power at the city level.  Cities, which are already the hub of national life and international relationships, should be further empowered to act as active problem-solving agents and assert their domestic autonomy.
There are some promising initiatives moving in this direction. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group has recognized the importance of urban leadership, bypassing their nations’ inability to escape gridlock and effectively respond to climate change. China’s special economic zones (SEZs) have followed Singapore’s lead as testbeds for economic and cultural innovation. Their small size enabled them to assert domestic autonomy and international credentials without putting all of China at risk. After they proved to be successful, the lessons learned in these zones could then be carefully disseminated across China.
These sorts of initiatives should become more common. Vesting power in smaller political units would encourage nations to be better neighbors, allow cities to push the boundaries of what it means to govern while maintaining a safety hatch for unhappy citizens to exit, and enable profound experimentation.

Caveats and open questions
Key open questions, i.e. the places you’re most likely to change my mind:Figures reported by the Singaporean government exclude large swathes of the population, but it’s hard to know exactly how much. The people they exclude tend to be "temporary" migrant workers, who make significantly less than their naturalized and permanent resident peers. We should expect the numbers we see to be less dazzling if we were to include them in the numbers. Even if we make the extremely conservative assumption that this doubles the population and that the migrant workers make zero income (which is clearly an overly conservative assumption), it’s still far wealthier than any other Asian country.Singapore — 52,960 USD per capita, if we divide by 2 with our generous assumption about migrant workers it's still 26,480, still one of the highest in all of Asia.Vietnam — 2,185 USD per capita (~13x)Malaysia — 9,502 USD per capita (~2.5x)Indonesia — 3,570 USD per capita (~7.5x)Thailand — 5,907 USD per capita (~4.5x)China — 8,123 USD per capita (~3.25x)A lot of rich people move to Singapore after they’ve earned much of their wealth. It’s a refuge for lots of Chinese and other Asians who’ve made a lot of money in their home country but want the stability and quality of life of Singapore."A counterpoint might be, maybe any reasonably networked citystate along a major trading route chokepoint would have 5x to 10xed." — Visakan"‘Impoverished island’ is disputed." — also Visakan. It makes for a great story that serves political ends, so his point on this makes me particularly skeptical that the starting point I compare against is the proper measuring stick. He also pointed out that the modern state of Singapore was founded right after WWII and a brutal Japanese occupation. As a result, measures from that time are a low point. It’s kind of like comparing your mile time between when you had the flu and a week after you’re back to health—it sure looks like you’ve gotten a lot faster in a short amount of time, but really you’ve just gotten back to where you’d otherwise be."Home ownership rates are kinda muddied by the fact that rent is exorbitant" — also  Visakan. The government subsidizes the purchasing of government-owned flats and builds them aggressively, so home ownership is cheap (relative to other major world cities). This isn’t exactly a counterpoint, because it still leads to high rates of homeownership, but under a certain value system one could argue that it "doesn’t count" or counts less than homeownership in the States. (Though that’s subsidized too, just in less visible ways…)
Further ReadingAn Economic History of Singapore offers a great overview of the city-state’s journey from humble beginnings to its immense prosperity. It also offers a perspective on some of the sacrifices made along the way to this success; in particular,  Singapore’s wealth inequality has been stubbornly high through the course of its history, though income distribution has become more equal.Lee Kuan Yew is a total badass. He led the People’s Action Party for over a half-century, in which he brought Singapore out from British colonial rule, through Singapore’s brief matrimony with Malaysia, and into independence marked by decades economic prosperity. In the first draft of this essay, I constantly found myself going on tangents about LKY, but I sadly had to slash many of them out because they distracted from my main point. But I don’t want to keep you from learning about this incredible (and controversial) man, so here are a few recommendations: This WSJ article by Orville Schell is a beautiful introduction to LKY, and his memoirs are definitely worth reading, too. Conversations with Lee Kuan Yew by Tom Plate is a quick, enjoyable read in dialogue form from a series of interviews the author conducted shortly before LKY’s death. It doesn’t go into as much depth as I would have liked, but it gave me a much better sense of LKY’s personality and outlook than some other profiles of him. This article from The Economist entitled "Go East, young bureaucrat" is a fascinating look into the inner workings of Singapore’s bureaucracy. Arguments for benevolent dictatorship always struggle with the issue of how to maintain talent and honorable goals within government, and this article offers some fairly compelling answers to that question.
Footnotes
* Singapore had a complex, disjointed political history in the two centuries preceding its independence. Control had passed through the hands of a half dozen regimes, each with very different political structures and objectives. It had been ruled by the Sultanate of Johor, colonized by British India, occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, and governed as a Crown Colony from London. It was briefly part of the Malaysian Federation following the dissolution of the British Empire but was pushed out after just two years. A quick timeline:Singapore began the 19th century as part of the Sultanate of Johor. In 1824, the island became a British possession and trading post under the British East India Company, and in 1826 it became part of the Straits Settlements under the jurisdiction of British India. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Malaya and crushed the Allied forces, resulting in what Winston Churchill called "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history". The Japanese occupied the island for the remainder of the war. The Allies bombed Japanese-occupied Singapore intensely, destroying much of the city’s infrastructure. After the war, Singapore briefly fell back under control of British India until the Straits Settlements was dissolved in 1946. Singapore then became a separate Crown Colony, controlled directly from London. However, the British Empire’s failure to defend its possessions in South East Asia had destroyed its credibility as an infallible ruler, and its control over the region weakened in the decades following WWII. In the wave of nationalism sweeping the colonial world, Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. At only about 1 million residents, the tiny island thought it couldn’t survive alone due to its scarcity of land, resources, and markets, and it wanted Malaysia’s support in a region succumbing to pressure by Communist forces. However, the Federation had defined its identity by its Malay majority, which didn’t fit with Singapore’s largely Chinese population. After two years of ethnic hostility, Singapore was expelled from the federation and forced to become an independent country.When Singapore first gained independence, the country was deeply divided due to its colonial history and polyglot population. (Singapore’s demographic breakdown upon independence: 75.4% was Chinese, 13.6% Malay, and 8.6% Indian.) LKY concluded that "everyone would simply vote for their own ethnic group and overlook the common interests of the country" if full democracy were implemented. In his foreword to Lee’s memoir From Third World to First –– The Singapore Story, Henry Kissinger wrote:When the state comprises diverse ethnic groups, political opposition is often considered an assault on the political validity of the state rather than of a particular government.By the time Singapore gained independence in 1965, many other post-colonial societies had already broken away from their European rulers and experimented with various forms of government. "The advantage we had was that we became independent late," explained LKY. "In 1965, we had 20 years of examples of failed states. So, we knew what to avoid — racial conflict, linguistic strife, religious conflict. We saw Ceylon [modern-day Sri Lanka]."Thanks to Michael Nielsen and Visakan Veerasamy for sanity checking this post (and in some cases arguing that parts are indeed insane).#travel

June 3rd, 2018
Epistemic status: High confidence about the pros/cons discussed regarding my own experience, fairly low confidence about the parts I heard secondhand. 
Epistemic effort: Low-to-medium effort. I realized these things were connected while I was in the shower last night, then I spent two hours stream-of-consciousness writing to get them onto the page. I then read it over once for minor editing and shared it with a friend to sanity check.

"Bike shedding" is one of the best terms I've learned in my time as a software engineer. It refers to giving disproportionate weight to marginal but easy-to-grasp issues while more serious ones are overlooked. (It originates from an apocryphal story of a committee whose job it was to approve plans for a nuclear power plant. Instead, the committee spent the majority of its time discussing what materials to use for the staff bike shed.)

Programmers are notorious for falling into this trap. I suspect we're far more susceptible to it than even the nuclear engineers in that story, because developer tools are highly customizable by nature of themselves being software. Many of us got into coding in the first place because we enjoyed tweaking (or better yet building from scratch) our workspace to fit our preferences.

This deep customization works great when you first start coding—most people's early experiences are little personal projects they build alone—but disagreements arise when you start to work with other engineers who inevitably have their own, totally different preferences. Some of these are useful, but most of them are arbitrary. Whether to use tabs or spaces, which continuous integration service to choose, whether to force alphabetical ordering of imports or to not... the list goes on and on. This is like deciding which side of the road to drive on. You should not really care if you're on the left or the right as long as you're driving on the same side as everyone else.

I'm as much a culprit as any other developer. Formatting in particular has always been the source of many wasted hours tweaking lines of code and, worse, leaving little "nits" in code reviews. This year, I'm proud to say I've gone cold turkey with wasting time on code formatting, though it's not a function of my self control. These days I use Prettier, an opinionated Typescript formatter. Given a valid program, it will reprint the code from scratch in conformance to a strict, consistent style.

Take the following example from Prettier's docs:It fits in a single line so it's going to stay as is. However, we've all run into this situation:Suddenly our previous format for calling function breaks down because this is too long. Prettier is going to do the painstaking work of reprinting it like that for you:This is great! It's even more powerful when you configure the whole project so that every developer who works on the codebase deals with the same rules. Suddenly, we're not wasting time formatting whitespace in our own code. More importantly, we're not starting comment threads on Github about why it would be nice to have a little more whitespace here, a little less whitespace there, and an extra semicolon over there "just to make it a little more clear".

(Some relevant history to avoid a flamewar with my friends who are Go enthusiasts: Pretter was inspired by Gofmt, a tool that automatically formats Go source code. The Go Blog has a great overview of why code formatters are powerful. I'll leave it to you to explore the arguments. 🙂)

At a BBQ yesterday, a friend mentioned an ambitious infrastructure project he worked on a few years ago. It was a new type of transportation network with lots of multidisciplinary work between engineers, planners, service people, technocrats, and business owners. This particular technology hadn't been tried before, which is what made him so excited to work on it but also the reason it failed. I asked him what happened, and he said the core problem was one of interfaces: because nothing like this had been built before, every single responsibility and dependency had to be explicitly discussed before anything could move forward. For conventional projects, the roles of various team members are well-defined and understood, but for something new these roles have to be hashed out on the fly.

Without understood patterns about how to solve problems, the project was bogged down with inefficient overlaps of focus as well as gaps that everyone thought were someone else's responsibility. Coordination to figure out who owned each piece was time-consuming and expensive, resulting in budget overruns.

Specifically, he noted that many pieces of the project were not well understood. Because no one had built this kind of network before, the people working on the project didn't have defined patterns about how to tackle problems as they arose. It wasn't even that the individual technical problems were extremely challenging, more that it was hard to know who was responsible for executing the solution. He said the project was bogged down by having to coordinate whose responsibility each piece was, resulting in everything taking far more time than in more conventional infrastructure projects.

I thought this was fascinating. I hadn't considered the possibility that the well-established common knowledge that characterizes more conventional projects was such an advantage. The failure wasn't in the design itself—the failure was that the interfaces were ambiguous.

I'm generally not a big follower of traditional gender roles. As a female engineer who was the only girl on her 2nd grade Pony Baseball team and served as the editor of her college's libertarian-leaning paper, I'm a bit of a statistical anomaly as far as feminine stereotypes go. However, there is one traditional gender norm  wish we hadn't done away with so fast: men picking up the check.

This is not about getting a free meal—I'd be just as happy if the norm were reversed. The thing we've lost by throwing away this tradition is simplicity. Instead of a simple rule where everyone knows what to expect, receiving the bill at the end of dinner turns a fun date into an awkward test that stresses out both parties.

Renegotiating these issues every single time you grab a drink or a bite to eat with someone of the opposite gender is exhausting. I always worry: "If I insist on grabbing the check, will he feel like I'm trying to make some feminist statement? If I don't grab the check, will he think that I'm just trying to take advantage of gender roles to get a free meal, even though I probably make as much if not more than him?" I've never been on the opposite side of this, but I can only imagine the concerns running through his head are even more intense: "If I grab the check, will she think I'm trying to impose gender norms on her? That I don't think she can pay for it herself? And if I don't grab the check will she be offended that I didn't do the gentlemanly thing and offer?"

No matter what you do it comes off as a political statement. It's like deciding whether to use he, she, (s)he, or they (I'm not going to list all of the possibilities because we could be here all night...) when you need a generic pronoun to discuss a hypothetical person. Back when every writing style guide prescribed the generic "he", it was a trivial choice. Now it's up to the writer to decide, turning a small technical detail into a distracting decision. The upside of this cultural shift may be worth it, but the ambiguity comes with a cost.

I've been lucky to be in wonderful long-term relationships, which means we get past these worries pretty darn quickly and just move on to the fun part of hanging out. But it's still annoying to hash out who pays each time. We roughly want to keep it even, but we also don't want it to feel transactional by keeping some sort of tally. I've toyed with the idea of flipping a coin each time, which results in a fair split if you hang out a lot, but that still involves annoying overhead. It would be so much easier if we could just pick a simple rule and stick with it.

I miss this norm of men picking up the check not because I think it's inherently "the right way" but because it is useful. 

(This obviously goes without saying, but it'd be wishful to think it's not necessary to  state explicitly: defaulting to traditional gender norms has its obvious flaws, and on net I'm pleased to live now rather than 50 years ago when women needed their husband to cosign on a loan.)

4.

When I was younger, I thought tradition was patently ridiculous. Why would you do something just because people had been doing it for years before? That sounded like a silly reason to do anything, besides maybe some aesthetic appeal that didn't resonate with me at all. If another system worked better, I thought, you should switch to that without hesitation.

In the past few years, I've realized that another word for tradition is "convention", and conventions can be really useful. They can save time and headaches if everyone knows what to expect from everyone else. This simplicity is not necessarily worth the other problems it causes—there are times when we should seriously consider bucking tradition, and it's worth pushing the envelope to see if some new way of doing things works better—but the tradeoffs are real, and we should order our priorities carefully. Sometimes, throwing away convention just for the sake of not "arbitrarily" following tradition can create its own problems.

 Agglomeration effects (might) change the YIMBY calculus

                  Agglomeration effects (might) change the YIMBY calculus
                  

July 15th, 2018
Epistemic status: Pretty sure of the structure of the argument (~80%), not so sure of the valence of the coefficients (~60% that agglomeration does not overwhelm the supply-demand effect).
Epistemic effort: Medium effort. This idea has bounced around my head for almost a year, and over that time I spoke with several friends about it. Then, I had a long conversation in which I formalized it a bit more, at which point I decided to write it down. I then read it over once for minor editing and shared it with one friend to sanity check before publishing.
There's a distinction within the YIMBY cause that's mostly unspoken, but it's important. Two of the key goals the movement aims to address are (1) to lower housing prices and (2) to unlock economic, cultural, and social potential. These are often described in similar ways and are in many cases complementary, but they are not the same.

On one hand, there's a lot of talk about how building more will decrease prices because of the models of basic supply and demand curves from Econ 101. We'll call this goal the affordability objective: let's make housing affordable in key metro areas, both for residents who are already there and for those who'd like to come. Another related but different goal is about how much is lost as a result of locking people out of opportunities in the most productive regions. We'll call this the opportunity objective: let's make it possible for people to to participate in the economic and cultural dynamism in places that they're locked out of right now.

Most YIMBYs care about both objectives. However they are different, so it's useful to disentangle them and discuss the circumstances in which they might conflict:For example, imagine we could know for sure that building more housing in San Francisco would have no effect on its price, and the only effect would be to make it possible for more people to move here. An affordability-focused YIMBY would not be happy with this outcome. In this hypothetical they would not push for more housing. They'd direct their energies towards subsidized housing, rent control, and other measures that would result in a lower price for some segment of the population. Meanwhile, an opportunity-focused YIMBY would continue to push for more housing.Now imagine a second scenario in which some policy decision would dramatically lower the cost of living here but not expand the number of units available. The affordability-focused YIMBY would be thrilled, while the opportunity-focused one would remain dissatisfied.
Of course these instances are contrived. The YIMBYs I know care about both affordability and the opportunity, and the consensus is that building more housing will move us towards both goals, so the interests of both factions are aligned. However, implicit in many conversations is a ranking of which is more important, affordability or opportunity. When push comes to shove, which are we fighting for? It's important to understand this distinction and what would cause misalignment if a few assumptions prove to be incorrect.

As simple as supply and demand... right?
The standard YIMBY view is roughly summed up as "the law of supply and demand applies to housing too". The logic goes:Zoning and other restrictions on density artificially restrict supply, creating a shortage. (This looks suspiciously like the classic Monopoly Problem graph like the one here on the right... but let's save that for another time...)There is greater demand than there is supply, so costs go higher than they otherwise would (sad for those who prioritize affordability), and fewer people than would like can live in that region (sad for those who prioritize opportunity).If we were to lift these restrictions and allow the market to respond to these price signals in a competitive way, the supply would increase to meet the demand, and the price would go down. (Happy for both affordability- and opportunity-focused YIMBYs. Yay!)

Following this model, society is on net better off without the restrictions artificially constraining supply. The constraints create deadweight loss, a net loss of producer and consumer surplus. Lifting them unlocks this surplus, lowering the prices for tenants and homebuyers and making it possible for more people to move in. Loosening zoning laws and other constraints on the housing market achieves both affordability and opportunity. Awesome, I can wrap up this post and go for a pre-dinner run now. Done!

Just kidding, we're not done. This supply-demand model ignores something important: the value of living in a particular place is greatly determined by how many people live around it. As the number of people living in a place increases, so does the value of being there. This is often labeled the "agglomeration effect".

Rent for a home in San Francisco 4x more than an equivalent home in Kern County just a few hours away. The dirt here isn't any better than the dirt over there—in fact it's quite a lot worse, since Kern is in the fertile Central Valley. Rather, the differentiator is that this is where more people are. Kern has 100 people per square mile, while San Francisco has 18,860. If we somehow held all other things equal and emptied out San Francisco to match the density of Kern County, the value of living here would drop dramatically. SF's population density means job opportunities, deep talent pools, professional and business networks, economies of scale, diversity and convenience, and so much more. A large population supports a qualitatively different kind of economy than a smaller one. A city nearly 200x the size of a town is not just that town multiplied by 200. It's something different altogether. An article from The American Interest captures this idea: (emphasis mine)
How does this density and diversity enable urban life? Consider the neighborhood bodega in a big city. Its lifeblood is the constant flow of foot traffic generated by the surrounding urban fabric—the many overlapping entrances and exits of the "ballet of the sidewalk," as Jacobs famously described it. Large concentrations of both residential and working uses, connected by a walkable network of streets, draw people out at different times of the day, allowing the shop to open earlier and stay open later, thus reaping more profit and providing more convenience to customers. In other words, just like a bee pollinates flowers as it collects food for its young, the many customers that shop at the bodega unknowingly collaborate to create more choice, convenience and opportunity in the urban environment, simply by living their daily lives. Meanwhile, this virtuous cycle between pedestrian and shopkeeper also adds more watchful sets of "eyes on the street" to keep it safe from crimes of opportunity, and builds up a loose network of casual relationships between neighbors, a fund of "social capital" to be used in times of need.
Accounting for the agglomeration effect
The issue with the conventional supply-demand model is that it assumes that supply and demand are functions of price and price only. At a first approximation, and maybe at the margins, this is basically true. However, it does not account for the fact that the population is also a critical factor in determining the shape of the demand curve for a particular place.

If we were to overnight double the number of units available in a market and they all filled up to match the demand, we're now dealing with a radically different market. The amount of foot traffic to shops would spike, making it much more valuable to rent storefront retail space. The number of companies would grow dramatically, resulting in a greater diversity of opportunities for workers. And the number of workers would grow, making the labor market more liquid and deep for employers to hire for the positions they need.

This agglomeration effect is analogous to the network effects in social media, marketplaces, and other platforms. Facebook is valuable because that's where your friends and family are. AirBNB is valuable because guests know that's where they'll find listings, and hosts know that guests will search for a place to stay. iPhones are valuable because the App Store is full of high quality apps, and developers continue to build on iOS since they know there are 90 million iPhone users out there to download their apps.

Cities are a platform like any other; the more talented workers, innovative companies, fun restaurants, and quirky shops there are, the more people will come to participate. This feeds into itself, generating increasing value, unless access is constrained (for instance by strict immigration, immigration restrictions, or something else). 

We could (super roughly) model this total value growth as the square of the number of people, n^2. In other words, the number of potential connections (between customers, firms, and employees, just for starters... let alone friends, romantic partners, etc) grows quadratically with the number of people when looking at the system as a whole. This is of course a simplistic model, in that it doesn't take into account limitations on one's ability to capitalize on these opportunities—sure maybe there are 1M eligible men for me in NYC, but if I were to move there there's only so much time in my life for me to date that there may as well be half as many because I'm only going to have so many dates in my life. Despite the limitations of this model, it doesn't feel terribly off, because there's still a pooling effect. I may not be able to meet every single one of the million eligible bachelors in NYC, but I can use heuristics to put myself into groups of people where I'm most likely to find the man of my dreams, and those groups are more likely to be of high concentration of what I care about in a place where the pool of people is extremely large. To think about this another way, the average male height in China is relatively short by American standards, just 5'5" to the US's 5'10", but several of the tallest living people live in China simply because it's such a big country. As a percentage, they make up a tiny sliver of the population, but as long as I can find a Center for my NBA lineup I just need one. A lot of real-life problems have this structure. But I digress...

The supply-demand model does not take this agglomeration effective into account. The point of is that, depending on the magnitude of this effect, increasing the supply could actually increase the cost of housing. The reason real estate in New York City is multiples more expensive than in upstate New York is because of the combinatorial characteristic of the opportunities there, not because there’s something different about the soil its on. If you split NYC's population into 10 distinct, distant cities, the land values in each of them would be significantly less than the combination of them all, because the number of possible connections between people, firms, opportunities, and ideas is so much lower.

A YIMBY civil war? Probably not, luckily...
This sounds like terrible news for the YIMBY coalition. This agglomeration model might imply that as we build more, prices would go up. This would split the camps right down the middle. Building more would work towards the opportunity objective but bring us even further from affordability. 

Luckily, I have some good news. These two priorities may not actually contradict one another as much as I've implied, for two reasons:

(1) The coefficients of each piece are really important. Maybe agglomeration effects from increased population do increase the value of being in a place, but the conventional supply-demand curve logic overwhelms this effect by having a larger decreasing effect on prices. (This seems very likely to me. My intuition tells me that building more units would inject competition into the market at a faster rate than the marginal new resident would add to the network effect. I'm doing some empirical work right now to get a better sense of the effects... will share when I'm done and update here!)

(2) The entire bottom part of the market is cut off right now. Even if #1 isn't true, we can still work to expand the stretch of the market through regulatory reform, technical innovation, cultural change, etc. In other words, we can try to figure out how to fit more people into the space we do have. A lot of laws exist to effectively cut out the bottom part of the market. (The mechanism here is similar to the argument for how the minimum wage is in fact bad for the very low-wage workers it aims to protect.) Laws like minimum lot sizes, setbacks, amenity provision, max numbers of occupants, etc effectively make it illegal to build affordable housing. Many of these laws were introduced to protect people from unsafe tenement living conditions, and probably rightfully so. But some of them are definitely not for the sake of safety or consumer protection (e.g. setbacks, certain aesthetic requirements, height restrictions). If we could peel back the laws that make it prohibitively expensive to offer cheap housing, we could lower the marginal cost of building, which should in turn lower the market rate.

Tokyo is a useful example here. It’s experienced the same return-to-the-city wave as other developed nations, yet land prices have remained steady. I point to Japanese willingness to squeeze the value out of a place rather than insisting on extravagant space requirements as the key driver of this affordability. There’s a reason Japan is famous for its capsule hotels and small apartments—Japanese land use policy allows and encourages it! Of course most people would prefer to live in a big apartment than in a tiny closet-sized one, but in Japan they at least have that option. By allowing landowners to serve the bottom end of the market, it lessens pressure on the rest of the market. By contrast, in the US there is a floor to the amount of space you can offer someone. Again this regulatory impulse comes from a good place—it can be legitimately dangerous and unsanitary to cram people in tiny space—but we could go much farther than we currently do while still maintaining a baseline level of safety and comfort for everyone.

... but let's learn more
The purpose of this post is mostly to note the distinction between these two (maybe conflicting?) priorities in the YIMBY movement; I myself am not settled on the question of whether the agglomeration effect overwhelms the supply-demand effect. At the margins YIMBY activists are working at right now, I think it's much more likely than not that the affordability and opportunity objectives are aligned. Curious to get others' input, especially if you have data/models I didn't mention here. I'm working on some analysis to determine what these coefficients are in order to figure out whether they are in conflict or not. Will share the results in a follow up post!

In the US, it's common for local governments to focus on tax revenue produced by a property, without considering the costs it adds to the city's budget. This is like measuring how far a car can drive without considering how much gas it uses to get there.

Different properties create different long-term cost burdens for the city. One of the biggest contributors to that variance is the amount of infrastructure they require, which correlates with the amount of space they take up.

For just 1 building per acre, you need far more roads/pipes/etc per building than if you build 10 buildings per acre. Lower density doesn't really increase tax revenue per building, so you're essentially taking on a lot more infrastructure liability to support the same revenue.Spreading development across a lot of land requires more infrastructure, resulting in higher costs per building.Clustering development on less land reduces per-building costs, because the cost of the infrastructure is spread over more units.Consider two properties in Asheville: a Walmart and a small downtown building. The Walmart is worth $20M and uses 34 acres, while the downtown building is worth $11M and uses 0.2 acres. At first blush, the Walmart seems better because it generates more tax revenue. But once you look at the denominator, you see that the downtown building generates 100x more tax revenue per acre!$20,000,000 / 34 acres = $588,000 / acre$11,000,000 / 0.2 acres = $55,000,000 / acreWhen we build sprawl without accounting for the long-term liabilities, we create unsustainable infrastructure costs that can overwhelm city budgets in the long-run. For example, Detroit's sprawling layout and declining population left it with extensive infrastructure to maintain but insufficient tax revenue, contributing to its 2013 bankruptcy.

This doesn't mean we should never build low density places, but we should be aware of the tradeoffs. We have to to consider the costs and not just revenues, otherwise we will continue to build ourselves into a hole!Detroit pioneered the sprawl development pattern, which depends on perpetual growth in order to continue working. This development pattern was a major contributor to its financial troubles a few decades later when its infrastructure bills came due.Cities that emulate traditional development patterns like downtown Charleston earn more revenue in a small area while costing far less in infrastructure expenses.

 Vacuum tube nostalgia


                  Vacuum tube nostalgia
                  

October 21st, 2019
Music enthusiasts will tell you there's nothing quite like "tube sound", the warm, rich sound quality that old vacuum tube amplifiers bring to the music played through them. And they'll pay top dollar for it! Once considered obsolete, vintage vacuum tube amps now sell at a premium, because audiophiles want to reproduce the harmonic distortions this old tech is so famous for.
This now-beloved distortion was initially seen as a bug, not a feature. It was an unintentional byproduct of the technology used at the time, an artifact of how vacuum tubes work rather than a premeditated characteristic of the hardware design. Later, we developed transistor amps, which have a "pure" sound that eliminated those distortions. Only once those transistor amps came onto the scene did audiophiles begin to reminisce about "tube sound". In fixing the flaws of the old paradigm, the new design brought to light that some of those flaws—like tube sound—were actually quite enjoyable.
A vacuum tube amplifier (a.k.a. valve amp)
A transistor amp (a.k.a. solid-state amp)Technical constraints can give rise to incidental but delightful flaws, beyond just "tube sound". Embracing these euphonic distortions is a common way people relate to and embrace outdated tech. CRT televisions, 8-bit pixel art, and sepia photography all have enthusiasts who adore these once-ubiquitous technologies. We've now surpassed the technical limits of those old mediums, but these aficionados savor precisely the aesthetics produced those old constraints that have been "solved" by newer tech. They take inspiration from those aesthetics and recreate them with new technology.

Pixel art is thriving in our 1280x1024-resolution world. Delightfully, this gif also shows off our contemporary taste for CRT-style scan lines, too. Two-for-one!

Example of the famous CRT scan line effect deliberately applied to an image. 
Sepia is a popular tag on instagram.
These old, flawed mediums are nostalgia machines, and that's a big part of the draw. You don't have to be a CRT television connoisseur to appreciate their distinct aesthetic. Their crackly flicker, scan lines, and magnetic damage make each of these TVs a time machine, teleporting you back to an earlier era. 

Euphonic distortion, in the purest sense, is a product of is time. In a way these distortions are most "authentic" artifacts of a given era. No one planned for them, and only after removing these random errors do we appreciate the value they added. Their lack of self-consciousness is disarming. Euphonic distortion is authentic because it's not something you'd come up with; it simply arises as a function of the technical constraints of a particular moment. 

But it's not just about nostalgia. The constraints imposed by an old technology can also produce joy in their own right. For example, stick-shift cars make you feel one with the vehicle in a way an automatic transmission cannot. The extra complexity to shift gears in manual transmission cars is exactly why most American consumers abandoned them for automatic... and it's exactly what draws enthusiasts back to manual cars. What was once a function of circumstance is now a conscious choice.

Of course this "vacuum tube nostalgia" is not the fate of every historical glitch. Few accidental artifacts are beloved. Many more are abandoned as fast as we come up with a better way, something that overcomes that a limitation. For example, screen burn-in is a phenomenon of phosphorus-based monitors that happens when a specific image literally burns the inside of the screen over a prolonged period. I find it hard to imagine that anyone would want that effect. You're never going to get a burn-in filter on Instagram. It just looks dirty and gross, and makes it hard to see other images on the screen later. Most flaws go the way of burn-in. Very few are actually charming or nostalgic; most are simply worse than the new and improved ways of doing things, and we abandoned those practices for good reason.


Burn-in just doesn't look good. We're not going to get a burn-in filter on Instagram any time soon.Even those few historical glitches that are beloved work well in some contexts but not in others. While I adore the aesthetic of 8-bit pixel art, I wouldn't want to live in the world of the 1980s, when digital artists were so constrained in their expression. The inflexibility of their medium gave rise to a beautiful, distinctive art style, but it also inhibited the range of aesthetic experiences they could create.

As much as I love 8-bit art, I'm glad digital artists like Dan Luvisi are no longer constrained by a narrow pixel palette for all of their work.We can have the best of both worlds: digital artists now have a far more varied palette to choose from as they create art, but they can also go back to the old constraints of pixel art when seeking that particular style. Their toolset is all the richer for having gone through a period of arbitrary, unintended technical constraints, because 8-bit art is a style they may not have realized was possible or desirable if they hadn't at one point had the constraints.

Footnotes
1 – There's now a thriving market for this obsolete amplifier technology, for the precise reasons that once made it outdated and uncompetitive. These amps are pricey, especially original vintage ones. If you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on your own tube amp, you can add artificial distortions through a special feature of many modern amps or in the post-processing step of an audio-editing tool. Many modern songs use this aesthetic in intros or as a trick to set the scene and set a particular aesthetic and time, and even recording studios that work in an all-digital medium use tube pre-amplifiers inside of microphones.
2 – I'm not an expert on any of this! Most of what I know here is from conversations with old musician friends and casual research. Please correct/add to this if you know more.

 Misreading Milei: The American press can only see Argentina through a US lens

                  Misreading Milei: The American press can only see Argentina through a US lens
                  

December 12th, 2023
It's been frustrating to see the US coverage of Milei, Argentina's new president. The American press seems to deeply misunderstand what's going on. It seems the US reporters can only understand Argentine politics through the lens of the US, when really it's just a totally different situation. 
For one thing, the American press loves to call Milei a "populist", which couldn't be more incorrect. He ran against the populist left (the Peronists), and all the key policies he's proposing are a direct attack on what populists want! 

In particular, whenever Peronists are in power, they print pesos at an increasing rate over time in order to have more money as spoils to distribute to their supporters. Although this causes inflation in the long-run, this patronage is popular because it creates new jobs (whether or not they're needed) and pays social welfare programs and subsidies. This is a huge part of how the Peronists get reelected. 

Printing money also wipes away household debt, because inflation eats at the value of the principal. This is popular because in the short term, it's good for borrowers. It's bad for lenders, but there are far more borrowers than there are lenders. (However this is also bad for borrowers in the long term, because lenders stop lending as soon as they learn that they will lose all their money if they lend it out, so borrowers can no longer borrow! As just one example consequence, there is no mortgage industry in Argentina, so it's really hard to afford a house.)

Milei intends to shut down the money printing. He's also mentioned the possibility of dollarizing Argentina's economy, i.e. use the US Dollar as the official currency and get rid of the peso. Dollarization would tie Argentina's hands forever from a monetary perspective so that if Peronists win again, they wouldn't be able to start printing money like they always have in the past, because they'd no longer have control over the monetary policy. Long story short, it's anti-populist to halt the money printing gravy train, and it's silly that the American press keeps calling him a populist!

The American press also loves to call Milei the "Trump of Argentina", a comparison that simply doesn't map to what I've seen. I've watched many of Milei's speeches, and he's much more like Milton Friedman than Trump. The policies Milei says he'll push for are totally different, and he has a lot more philosophical consistency than Trump ever did. The only serious similarity I see to Trump is that they're both political outsiders who surprised everyone when they won the presidential election.

Frankly seeing the US coverage of Argentina's election makes me wonder how much the American press gets wrong when they write about other countries too… If they have no idea what they're talking about when they write about Argentina, how can I trust what they write for other countries?

P.S. When Milei won the election a few weeks ago, I wrote a brief post about the context of why Milei was elected: https://devonzuegel.com/a-libertarian-just-won-argentina-s-presidency-what-s-going-on

                  Google Maps Convinced Me to Ditch My Car
                  

June 30th, 2016
I am always a little embarrassed when people find out that I had a car in college. I'm a transit geek after all, and I always encourage friends to take public and on-demand transit rather than generate congestion and consume parking spots. Despite all this, I drove multiple times each week last year, because I felt like it was my only real option to get to places I needed to go around the Bay Area.
Now, I rarely drive anymore, and I've become an avid user of public transit. Increasingly, my car has spent days and sometimes even weeks at a time in the same parking spot. What's the source of this change? You might conclude that my commute has changed or that my financial situation has shifted. Both of those are good guesses, but neither one is responsible for my embracing public transit.
No, in fact the source of the change is that Google Maps' transit layer is fantastic, something I discovered when I traveled to Berlin last summer. In the three weeks I was there, I relied entirely on public transit and, in turn, Google Maps to navigate the the German city's multi-model transportation system.
To be entirely honest, I was terrified of public transit before this point. I grew up in suburbia with minimal public transit options, so I had only used subways in my few childhood visits to New York City, during which my parents held my hand and guided our family through what at the time I perceived as a scary labyrinth filled with monsters quite a bit worse than the Minotaur. Combined with a handful of missed connections while attempting to traverse Chicago's bus network and what came to be an expectation of Caltrain's lateness, my experiences with public transit translated into concern and anxiety. Combine that with being in a city by myself where I spoke the native language at the level of a three-year-old, I was terrified that I would have no idea how to get around.
In other words, I simply did not know how to use public transit, because no one had ever taught me how to use it. But here I was in a city by myself, in which car-sharing services like Uber and Lyft were banned. So despite my concerns, with no affordable alternatives, I had to brave the transit system.
Armed only with my smartphone and boundless optimism, I stepped out of Berlin's Tegel Airport with a tiny ball of excitement in my belly. At last, I was going to prove to myself and to the world that my suburban upbringing hadn't cripped my spatial reasoning skills!
Imagine my disappointment (and relief) when I discovered that Google Maps can tell you step-by-step how to get anywhere with public transit as well as it can by foot or by car! Rather than fumbling around asking strangers for directions in my broken German or god forbid attempting to read the faded maps at the transit stations, I spent the remainder of my stay blissfully following Google's concise, accurate directions.
When I came back home to California, I figured "heck, if the directions were so great in Berlin then why shouldn't they work well here in the Bay Area, at the heart of the tech community and home to Google itself?" It was at this moment that the entire world of transit truly opened up to me. Stanford's free Marguerite bus system was no longer part of the background. It became a major fixture in my life, the way I get myself to the Caltrain, which I then use to get to Mountain View or up to the city. Before, the Marguerite was a mystery; now, the complexity is reduced down to a simple abstraction, a button tap away from instant knowledge of how to get from point A to point B.
I had some previous experience with the Caltrain, but it too became so much easier to use. It felt much more manageable, particularly for those multi-modal trips where I depended on connections with BART or the Marguerite or some other form of transit to get to my final destination.
In giving the Bay Area's various transit options another chance, I discovered a wide array of further benefits that I had not previously considered. I quickly saw "freedom from car ownership" as the real benefit rather than "freedom of car ownership". For one, I had much more time to myself to read, listen to podcasts, or catch up on emails and work. Rather than devoting hours of my week to mindlessly keeping my eyes on the road in order to drive between destinations, I am able to do whatever I want when I am in transit.
Furthermore, my greatest concerns were quickly squelched by experience. In particular, I was extremely worried about those trips where I didn't have access to public transit, off-the-grid trips away from arterial transit routes. This fear turned out to be basically unfounded. For one thing, despite popular gripes about how underserved transit is along the peninusla, Google Maps helped me discover that transit actually covers the vast majority of places where I want to go. Even in the South Bay, which I've always considered depressingly suburban, there is a thriving bus system that strings together the towns along El Camino.
In the few cases when transit truly does not serve the point in space-time to which I wish to go, on-demand services like Uber or Lyft are always an option, and they are surprisingly affordable for short journeys. The one use case for which I have not been able to find a suitable car-free option is weekend road trips, but even then there are always Zipcar rentals or borrowing a friend's car. In my particular case I also have the luxury of living close to my parents' home, which means I could also call upon them to borrow their car, and even in the most urban neighborhoods, most social circles have at least one person who would be willing to lend out their car for a special occasion.
My previously-held perception of public transit as unsafe and dirty quickly came to pass as well. While I still prefer to not take the BART late at night and I make a point of using the restrooms before boarding Caltrain (those toilets are truly nasty), at no point have I questioned my safety in my various public transit escapades along the peninsula.
The moral of the story here is that none of these systems are actually new. The Bay Area's transit system has been around longer than I have been alive, and the Marguerite shuttle system was in place and an option for the entirety of my Stanford career. Me entire behavioral shift can be attributed to that initial moment as I stepped off the airplane in Berlin and realized I had no idea how I was going to get from the airport to my hostess's home in Prenzlauer Berg. It took an initial shock to push me out of my default habits and reconsider my transit options.
There is a critical lesson to be learned here – cities can build the most state-of-the art transit systems and make them as accessible and convenient as possible, but unless individuals have a direct reason to reconsider their transportation decisions they likely will not make the shift.
This applies to a broad array of people beyond just me. We are at a particularly opportune time to change the way Americans – especially young people – think about mobility. Due to a broadening array of transit options and rising public interest in transportation due to the rise of on-demand transportation, people are open to reevaluating their transportation habits now more than at any other point since cars became a mainstay of American culture. A study by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) found that people in the 18 to 34 age group are more likely than those of other generations to choose the most practical transportation mode for each trip, rather than the traditional decision to make cars the single mode of transit for all purposes. The rise of smartphones too has had a tremendous impact. The flexibility and control in linking modes of transportation brought by tools such as Google Maps improves the experience for everyone, not just for me when I was stranded in Berlin. Now, transit is open to anyone with a smartphone and not just savvy locals experienced with the complexities of multi-modal public transit. Combine these factors with the fact that the current generation is more aware than any previous generation of global warming, and the result is that young people are primed for behavior change.
Despite all of these factors, many Stanford students in my position continue to opt to have cars on campus and use them daily. Even as a strong believer in the need for people to shift over to more sustainable forms of transportation, it wasn't until a shock to my system that I truly reevaluated the necessity of driving day-to-day. I applaud Stanford and the Bay Area as a whole in their efforts to expand accessibility and convenience of the transit systems, but they should redirect some of those efforts to simply dislodging ingrained behaviors. Financial, personal, and social incentives are already quite well-aligned for many individuals to make the switch from personal cars to multi-modal public transit – they simply need that little nudge, encouragement to reconsider their choices and reweigh the pros and cons of their options. I predict that if drivers were to simply reconsideer their options, many would change their behaviors without any other change to the system, just as I did.#travel

February 20th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.

As an urbanism nerd, the aspect of California Forever’s plan that I was most eager to hear about was land use and urban planning for the new city. From reading the ballot initiative and speaking with their team, I was pleased to see that their plan incorporates the hard-earned lessons we've learned about city development over the last 75 years. They recognize that the dominant sprawl development pattern is not working, and California Forever is trying to turn the tide of how cities and neighborhoods are developed in California.

As I dug deeper into the plan, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how seriously they took these ideas. California Forever is essentially proposing the urbanist dream. This might sound like hyperbole, but if voters approve the plan in the November election, it has the potential to be one of the best cities in the US. It will be a walkable city that improves quality of life and brings down cost of living by prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transit, using space efficiently, and removing unnecessary rules that slow down the ability to meet the demand for housing. 

Once I dove into the details, I was surprised by how much they differed from the press coverage. The dominant framing is that this city will be a futurist utopia run by tech nerds, but as far as I can tell, the plan is actually to build an urbanist utopia – not a technological one. The initiative and company website feel like they were written by YIMBYs, renewable energy advocates, and walkability activists, and they echo the philosophies of Jane Jacobs and Donald Shoup rather than Elon Musk or Steve Jobs.
An illustration from California Forever's website depicting the type of community they plan to build(A side note: While this is all a great concept, the next question is whether the plan actually has legs. California Forever certainly has its work cut out for it — the site has little existing infrastructure, it has no rail connection, and water is scarce across the entire state. I’ll dive into those questions in other posts in this series, but for the purpose of this post I’ll focus on what their goals are and whether I think they are worth striving towards to begin with.)

Here are some of the details from the initiative that stand out to me:

Emphasis on walking, biking, & high quality transit: Compact development is at the core of this proposal. It leads to walkability and enables efficient, high-quality transit services. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also fosters a sense of community and accessibility. Imagine being able to walk or bike to most of your destinations, with public transport as a convenient option for longer trips. The city plans to embrace townhomes and small apartment buildings that create gentle density, moving away from the sprawling single-family homes that dominate much of American suburbia. This approach allows for more people to live in a smaller area, preserving natural spaces and reducing the need for long commutes.Cyclists in nearby UC DavisA map of California Forever's proposed bike network, pulled from the ballot initiativeA focus on ‘missing middle’ housing: The plans feature housing that is fairly high density but not high rise — a combination of "row houses" between 2-4 stories high, and apartment buildings going up to 8 stories.  This is the type of neighborhood that makes up the most beloved places in the world. Places like Amsterdam, Venice, Santa Monica, Lake Como, Kyoto, and Lisbon are all made of missing middle housing.  

In political discussions about building housing, I sense that a lot of opponents are imagining the towering condo buildings of Hong Kong or Manhattan, but that level of density is not necessary to solve California’s housing crisis. Gentle density can make a dramatic impact in the housing supply. It's counterintuitive, but just going from standard suburbia to row houses, cottage courts, and small apartment buildings can get you into densities that are 4x+ those of suburbia!

It’s also significant that this type of middle density housing can be built with wood frame construction methods, which makes it more cost effective to construct. Reducing construction costs results in more housing being built, and at a more affordable price point.Beloved cities like and London and Amsterdam are made up almost entirely of missing middle housingForm based codes instead of zoning: Form-based codes are another innovative feature of this proposal. Unlike conventional use-based zoning, which restricts how buildings can be used, form-based codes focus on how buildings interact with each other to create a cohesive neighborhood. This allows for more flexibility and creativity in the use of space.

Conventional zoning might enforce rules like "you can only put restaurants and shops over here and you can only put homes over here", whereas form-based zoning says "as long as the building doesn’t generate noise at night between 9pm and 8am and its height is ≤4 stories, it can be used for whatever the owner thinks the neighborhood needs". For example, if someone wants to open a coffee shop on the first floor of their home, they can do so as long as it meets the standards set for its impact on its neighborhoods.

Technically the city will still have 4 zones, but the permitted uses table shows that these are not exclusive zones like you typically see in American zoning codes where only one use is permitted. They are more like different flavors of mixed use neighborhoods. For example, all types of residential uses are permitted in 3 of the 4 zones, and retail is permitted in 4 of the 4 zones. This is exciting to me because it's a lot more like how the Japanese approach zoning, which limits the "maximum nuisance" in a zone but then allows for any development below that threshold. You can think of this as whitelist vs blacklist approaches:

In North American zoning, zones typically allow only 1-2 uses
The Japanese include all uses up to a maximum "nuisance level"Granularity: The city also plans to embrace small parcel fabric (consisting of row houses and small apartment building), which allows for changes over time. This is in contrast to building in large blocks, whether through HOA associations of single family homes or via big apartment complexes with hundreds of units, both of which often freeze developments in place. The granularity of this approach is what makes places like Tokyo so special. Small storefronts will enable small businesses to thrive, and mixed uses will be encouraged. The diversity of things close to where you live makes it easier to walk and bike to where you want to be.Form based codes make it possible for you to walk to your favorite coffee shop in the morning  ·  La Marais Cafe in SFTokyo allows for tiny storefronts, which unleashes small businesses to express creativity and try new things 
Parking minimums are set at zero: Most US cities require you to build a tremendous amount of parking along with all construction, regardless of the demand for parking. The result: the area of parking per car in the US is larger than the area of housing per human! A groundbreaking aspect of California Forever’s proposal is setting the minimum parking requirement at zero for the entire city. This bold move encourages alternative modes of transportation and reduces the dominance of cars in the urban landscape. The saddest part: most required parking lies empty most of the time! Just look at these pictures of Tulsa, Rochester, and Camden – there's more space devoted to parking than there is to city!Minimum density is 20 units per acre: The voter initiative locks in at least 20 units/acre (~50 people/acre) as the minimum average density. This is similar to beloved neighborhoods such as Marina in SF, Centrum in Amsterdam, Kensington in London, and Historic Charleston in South Carolina. Even though people love these places, we’ve built close to zero of them in the past century. California Forever’s proposal would be one of the first communities of this sort built in the US for decades. I am so here for it!  Marina District in San Francisco has about 38 people/acre (above). Hayes Valley in San Francisco has a population density of about 58 people/acre (right)That density gets bumped up to 30 units/acre (~75 people/acre) in the downtowns, which are called Commercial Mixed Use zones. This makes a ton of sense, because those areas will have the highest access to services, jobs, restaurants, and shops, so it makes sense to allow for more people to live close by to access them.

And I’m pleased that ~50 people/acre is a minimum, because they can build some incredible places if they build more (not to mention make a bigger dent in the housing crisis. Some beloved places that are denser are Le Marais in Paris (73 people/acre), Beacon Hill in Boston (85 people/acre), and Eixample in Barcelona (144 people/acre). For more comparisons, here's a spreadsheet where I track urban densities around the world.  Plaza Real in Barcelona, Spain (left) and a street in Le Marais in Paris, France (above)Parking garages at the periphery: One of the more novel ideas in their plan is that "each transit line terminates at a parking garage at the edge of the city, making it easy to store cars at the periphery and proceed in on transit." This is a cool idea. I haven't seen it implemented before, but it makes a ton of sense. It recognizes the reality that cars are the dominant mode of transportation in the region and need to be accommodated, while also taking strides in the direction of making transit, cycling, and walking the dominant modes within their sphere of influence.  Above: Venice, Italy has a parking garage at the edge of the city, allowing for people to arrive by car and also enjoy the city as a pedestrianRight: A map of California Forever's proposed transit network, pulled from the ballot initiative
Rail-ready: While parking garages at the periphery is a great proposal, the project will be far more successful if they get a rail connection that connects the new city to the Bay Area and Sacramento. Rail is unfortunately not promised in the ballot initiative, and California Forever received criticism for this, but I don’t think it’s possible for the ballot initiative to include this in the first place — after all, Solano County voters cannot mandate rail unilaterally, because it involves other counties and state agencies.  

The good news is that California Forever seems to agree that rail is the right long-term solution. They speak about the project as "rail ready", and it is matched in the plan they’ve laid out for the rest of the city: a place that is dense, with a central transit station, so that it will actually generate high numbers of transit riders if and when a rail connection is built. 

Their lead planner Gabriel Metcalf said, "We will be working with all of those regional agencies, and I think it sort of goes without saying the city can’t grow past a certain point unless we are successful in building those external connections. I think we’re completely in agreement that we have to build external public transit." 

That said, I don’t think they signaled this hard enough at first, because many people’s immediate reaction was that they should have incorporated rail more seriously. While rail is a promise that’s not theirs to make (and therefore they couldn’t include it in the language of the ballot initiative), they could definitely have done a better job of making this clear from the start. California Forever realized that, and they updated the initiative to include a requirement to study and accommodate getting rail to the site, which signals their interest in making it happen. I’d love to see more steps in this direction—perhaps initiating public conversations with some of the relevant agencies and sister counties?—but this is a good start.

Predictable, fast approval process: One of the most radical changes by California standards is that they intend for the planning process to be swift and efficient. Their stated goal is that a complying project should be approved in just 10 days. This is a stark contrast to the often lengthy and cumbersome processes in most cities in California. 

From an urban planning perspective, I’m extremely excited by California Forever’s plan. I couldn’t dream of a better set of design principles for the most ambitious city building project that this country has seen in decades, and it seems that they have the right goals and team to build a truly special place. This is California’s chance to build a walkable, sustainable, and vibrant community that learns from the past and looks to the future. This could be the first walkable city in America in a century, and I can't wait to see it come to life!

I often use a thesaurus while coding, and I mentioned this fact to a non-programmer friend today. He was shocked, and he said that he thought that programming was mathematical, not lexical. But it’s not so easy to separate out—naming is one of the most important parts of programming (and math!), because it’s how you reduce complexity down to something that you can understand, explain, and maneuver.

The conversation reminded me of a post I read from Jane Street’s blog a while back:
Newell once told me that this was just names, and then he explained his understanding of names: "They provide distal access." That is, a name is a local piece of data that stands for some other piece of data, which is presumably large and remote. You can now use that small, convenient, local datum instead of the large, remote thing for which it stands. The key act you perform with a name (that is, a symbol) is ship it to that remote location, and get back the chunk of data it named. Newell said the career-making, fundamental "aha" experience of his entire life was realising that computers were not, as was typically held in the 1960’s, "number crunchers." They were symbol processors—something much more general. They processed names.

[…]

To invoke my opening quotation from the novel True Names, cultures have always attached a kind of magic to names, reflecting an intuitive understanding that names convey power and control; the reason for this is reflected in Newell’s summary of names as being a means of access. According to the book of Genesis, for example, the first act of Man was the assignment of names,3 something which symbolically (there’s that word, again) represents a transfer of control over the material world, as it is handed from its divine source over to human dominion.

Carter lectures the U.S. on energy, 1978

In 1798. the Reverend Thomas Malthus wrote his influential essay on population, arguing that population grows exponentially while the supply of food, energy, and other commodities only grows linearly.  As a result, the vast majority of humankind is doomed to be mired in poverty unless some even grimmer reapers than starvation (war, disease, etc.) are brought to bear, or births are moderated.  In 1978 U.S. president Jimmy Carter, reflecting a popular intellectual Malthusian sentiment of the time, sat by his fireplace in a comfy sweater and instructed Americans to turn down the thermostat lest we run out of oil.  (Here's a similar speech he gave a year earlier).

Malthus' description of a general pattern of human history (and indeed of the history of all living things, an observation that inspired Charles Darwin) was by and large accurate.  But since the time of Malthus, writing during the early industrial revolution, developed 
and even most developing economies have managed to trot or even race 
ahead of Malthus: per capita income has increased tremendously far beyond the near-starvation limits set by Malthusian theory.  Industrial productivity has pulled vastly increased amounts of commodities from the earth, using them to produce an unprecedented abundance of goods. Meanwhile population growth has radically declined until today many developing economies have below-replacement birthrates. Nevertheless, Malthus' observations and reasoning periodically stage an intellectual and popular comeback: industrial civilization can only cheat Malthus so long, thought leaders warn us; if we do not mend our unsustainable ways, and convert from gluttony to stringent conservation, Malthus' grim formula will soon return to wreak an awful revenge.


What chemical inputs does life depend on most?  Hydrogen and oxygen from water is plentiful. Plants obtain copious carbon by breathing in carbon dioxide (and animals from eating the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the plants or other animals). 
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (and legume plants that are symbiotic with them) 
obtain plenty of single-N nitrogen by splitting the plentiful but 
strongly bonded N2 in our atmosphere.  Artificial means of nitrogen fixing depend primarily on natural gas or oil prices. Metals are plentiful in soil. The
 only significant remaining scarce ingredients for crops are potassium (K) and 
phosphorous (P) -- and of these on land phosphorous, which must be 
available in the form of phosphate, is the most needed and most lacking of all.  No technology can substitute anything else for phosphate: it has to be phosphate in order to form DNA, the essential cell energy molecule ATP, and crucial parts of our bones and teeth. Phosphate is thus the most geopolitically important agricultural input and exhibit A in Malthusian warnings about limited resources and unsustainable practices.  This also makes phosphorous a favorite target of stockpilers and speculators during a Malthusian scare.

The most important commodity for mining, manufacturing, and especially transportation, for almost all the 20th century and through the present time, is petroleum oil. Internal combustion and other engines powered by fuels refined from petroleum have since the early decades of the 20th century increasingly dominated he transport of goods and people on air, sea, and land.  For much of the late 19th and 20th centuries heating was a major use 
of oil; in that use it is being eclipsed by its cousin carbon fuel, 
natural gas. Oil is also the world's most important feedstock for the 
production of plastics, synthetic fibers, and a wide variety of other 
chemicals. While oil makes up a much larger price value of trade than phosphates, oil in the long run is potentially far more vulnerable to substitution innovation. And as we shall see, it also has been at least somewhat more amenable to technological improvements in supply.

Between the mid-1800s, by which time the industrial revolution had transformed much of Europe, and the end of the Bretton Woods era, sentiments about the unsustainability of industrial civilization were usually on the intellectual fringe.  But since the late 1960s, cries of doom and sophisticated warnings that we must redesign our economy, our technology, and civilization itself to "sustainable" lifestyles have become mainstream.  Malthusian allegations that we face diminishing, or soon-to-be diminishing, supplies of raw materials such as oil, natural gas, metal ores and fertilizers,  have become "common knowledge." 

This component of green ideology has been fueled by two Malthusian scares: two substantial periods, the first between about 1968-1980, the second c. 2004-14, during which nominal commodity prices (i.e. the prices you see posted) increased dramatically,  and "real" (adjusted for some measure of inflation, such as the consumer price index) commodity prices increased substantially.  These price rises led to prophecies of a coming great diminution in our abilities to feed, cloth, and transport ourselves, much less to enjoy all the other abundant goods we have become accustomed to in the developed world as a result of the industrial revolutions that have occurred during and since the time of Malthus.  We faced a miserable future unless we changed our ways.  Unless we stopped having babies and stringently conserved and recycle our resources (the general green movement), or invest in solar power and electric cars (the Silicon Valley green movement), our future was deemed to be doom.  This remains a predominant ideology in Western culture today.

A big part of those scares and of the green movement has been environmental limits -- that we are damaging our environments, our planet, the one and only planet we can ever hope to naturally inhabit in the foreseeable future, far too much -- adding too much sulfur dioxide, ozone, or carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, too many fertilizers to our waterways, etc.  This essay does not address those concerns, which provide a far stronger argument for the sustainability movement than the topic of this essay -- the supply of commodities, especially of raw minerals from the earth such as oil, metal ores, and fertilizers, and the theories that have become popular since the late 1960s that historical rates of industrial growth cannot be sustained in the face of expected future diminution of those supplies.  Indeed, if you are already scared by our ability to pollute our planet, after you finish reading this essay you should be even more scared. Our planet places no material limits on our ability to consume and pollute it. If we are to have such limits we must put them in place, politically, ourselves.  (As for me, I'm scared both by the prospects for greater pollution and by the fact that political solutions and hoped-for advances in technology, not natural limits, will be the only ways to address the threats of pollution. The greatest source of domestic disputes is fighting over the thermostat; I expect this trend will carry over to international climate disputes of the future...)

For many of us in the developed world, a future of higher prices for energy and other commodities does not seem like such big a deal as it once did: we already have more physical goods than we know what to do with, and cutting back to achieve more peace of mind now seems to take and be worth more effort than accumulation. While the better-off fractions of the developed world have by and large reached a level of satisfaction in their consumption of the abundance of goods made possible by the industrial revolutions, the poorer fractions and the developing world have not. 

Nevertheless, during the Malthusian scares commodities did seem to grow much more expensive and scarcer -- and not just a few commodities but commodities in general.  Indeed, the prices of a broad range of industrial commodities went substantially higher, often much faster than the general inflation rate  -- a sure sign, according to traditional industrial economics, that industrial supply was being outstripped by consumer demand -- that we were getting approaching, often rapidly, Malthusian limits rather than moving further away from them as has been the general trend since Malthus.  During most of the years of the first and second scares raw material and food prices skyrocketed, practically across the board. Why was this happening, if not the predictions of Malthusians starting to come true?  Let's take a look at the scares, and the economic histories surrounding them, to find out.  

Prelude to the First Malthusian Scare

From ancient civilization to the late 1960s, civilization's money was generally defined by, and either consisted of or was convertible to, standard weights of precious metals. Even thousands of years before the invention of coinage, most fines in the earliest recorded code of laws were defined and paid in weights of silver.  While the role of precious metals in monetary affairs declined throughout the 20th century, with many episodes of fiat currencies untied to precious metals inflating and hyperinflating, under the post-World War II Bretton Woods system United States and its allies up to 1968 had a gold window whereby authorized high rollers (among them most other governments) could still cash in their dollars for gold at a promised official rate.  Under Bretton Woods most other free world currencies were pegged to the dollar.  So you could cash in your local currency for dollars, and (if you were an authorized high roller) your dollars for gold, all at committed official prices.

But Bretton Woods, depending on a single country to ultimately back the entire free world's money, was not financially sustainable.  It established the U.S. dollar as the free-world standard after World War II, when the the U.S. made half the world's industrial goods and held over half of its financial reserves. But the economies damaged by World War II quickly recovered, and agricultural and industrial revolutions spread to the developing world where economic growth greatly quickened.  While the U.S. economy in its own terms was thriving,  the relative U.S. role in the world economy declined as those of the rest of the world quickly rose from the ashes. By the mid-1960s the U.S. held only 16% of the world's financial reserves, and even less than that of its gold reserves.  Even though it promised to exchange dollars for gold on demand, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued more notes, and its banks more broadly issued more dollar credit, than could possibly be securely backed by its diminishing gold reserves.

Meanwhile, most academic and government economists scoffed at the gold standard as a "barbarous relic" and held that world monetary conditions would be improved if the U.S. stopped pretending that the dollar was pegged to gold.  By 1968 the U.S. was no longer willing to honor its commitment to deliver an ounce of gold for $35.  The U.S., which since the time of Franklin Roosevelt had banned the domestic private gold trade, now tried with futility to halt overseas private trade by refusing to deal in gold with governments that allowed private gold trade.  (In reality, this was less a serious attempt to stifle overseas private gold trade than an attempt to close down the gold window in a face-saving way).  The U.S. government forced the London Gold Pool, the gold window mechanism operating between the major free world central banks, to declare a "bank holiday", i.e. shut down its operations.  But of course this didn't stop non-Americans from trading in gold; quite the opposite: it signaled that the U.S. dollar, and all the currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, had radically changed in form, and might no longer be as reliable as a store of value. The free-market price of gold soon rose well above $35 official rate. The U.S. was by 1971 forced to officially float the dollar (it had already been floating de facto for up to three years), officially making the U.S. dollar a purely fiat currency.  The pegged currencies followed suit, and Bretton Woods was dead.

All this monetary obscurity matters for our Malthusian scares not just because all the aforesaid commodity prices from then until now are quoted in major fiat currencies, most usually in dollars, and these signals prices send about industrial supply and demand can only be as reliable as the currencies those prices are denominated in. Such a consideration could, with good statistics based on good records, be reasonably dealt with by computing the "real", inflation-adjusted prices of commodities.  But commodity prices proceeded to skyrocket even in general-inflation-adjusted terms The dawn of the pure fiat, floating currency regime caused far deeper forces to come into play.

For in reality, post-gold-standard prices for industrial commodities are not driven purely, or often even mostly, by industrial demand being met by appropriate changes in material supply.  Instead, both supply and demand curves have been warped by a new role for the major industrial commodities -- they are no longer purely commodities; the are in part also money.  In particular, they have since the late 1960s been increasingly used as a liquid store of value, easily tradeable for media of exchange (e.g. dollars), as an alternative to and hedge for the new regime of floating rate currencies.

 Noise in the signal: radical increase in volatility of two of the most 
important geopolitical minerals, crude oil and phosphate, between the 
Bretton Woods  (1947-70) and floating rate (1970-present) eras.

What does it mean to say a commodity is part money?  For this we need to turn to economist Carl Menger's theory of the origins of money.  Menger's theory is less an accurate account of how money did historically originate among humans (which happened long before the dawn of the efficient commodity markets postulated by Menger), as a good theory and reasonably accurate set of predictions about how a free barter market economy does behave whenever it does arise.  According to Menger, in a world of market-based barter, a very high cost (which economists would now call a transaction cost) comes from having to keep track of on the order of N^2 prices for the N goods, and the lack of coincidence of mutual wants between the holders of any two particular such commodities.

For this reason market participants start spontaneously treating some goods as intermediate commodities. Intermediate commodities are held, not to consume them, but to store value until the next opportunity for exchange comes along.  The intermediate commodity's price increases substantially from what it was when it was just demanded for its consumption: it obtains a price premium for its use as a store of value immune from the changing values of currency or currency-denominated assets the holder of the intermediate commodity would have otherwise held.  This price premium waxes and wanes with the weighted changes in inflation expectations of the world's main traded currencies.

Many commodities might be used this way: and every commodity that is used in this way becomes, in part, money.  It is no longer just an good whose supply is driven by purely by the costs of production (since producers may choose to withhold production rather than sell for a currency whose inflation expectations have just increased, or may choose to increase production beyond the needs of immediate demand when inflation expectations have decreased), or whose demand is driven purely by desires or needs for its consumption (since some of the demand -- the vast majority of the demand in the case of gold and silver -- is now for its use as a store of value). It is an intermediate commodity, partial money.

When the primary use of the commodity money is as a medium of exchange, for example the cigarettes used as money in some wartime prisons, strong network effects usually exist to cause the market to converge on one or a few standards -- historically, usually gold and silver.  These undergo a "bubble that does not pop". But the other intermediate commodities, the commodities don't make it all the way to being dominant and nearly pure money, are bubbles that can and do pop.

When the primary use of commodity money is, however, a store of value, a store of value that can be readily exchanged when needed for the actual medium of exchange, there is almost no network effect.  Any commodity that can be stored and so traded can be used as store of value that will render the owner immune from the perceived or actual risks of holding a floating currency. This storage could occur in the form of a paper or digital future, or as the actual commodity in the warehouse, or even as a readily extractable mineral such as oil still in the ground.

Since the end of Bretton Woods, the major industrial commodities, and especially the major geopolitical commodities such as oil and phosphates, have become Mengerian.  They are no longer purely industrial commodities.  They are also stores of value, places to put wealth in between obtaining money and spending it, that provide an alternative for those who wish to diversify away from, for various reasons, holding currency or assets such as bonds and derivatives that are defined by or correlated to the health of currencies.  In the face of increasing inflation expectations, stockpiling of commodities also decreases the risk that further economic growth that nations may be expecting or planning for in their economies could only come at the costs of even purchasing the needed inputs at even higher prices in the future (e.g. China in the 2000s). Stockpiling of commodities is also a general strategy whenever international trust erode and leaders start thinking of potential risks that trade will be slowed or embargoed.

There are other securities that can store and even grow value -- stocks, bonds, real estate.  In many ways all these are better stores of value than commodities.  However for a major financial and political power, they have drawbacks.  First, they are trust-based -- you are trusting somebody (often a foreigner) to pay the coupons or dividends.  In the case of real estate, it depends on the vagaries of local economic activity and politics. Commodities, especially commodities a government can physically control, are far more trust-minimized.  The U.S. can sanction Russia by freezing the assets of its national held in paper or digital form in the U.S., but it cannot take the oil from Russia's wells or stop it from drilling, pumping, and selling it to e.g. Europe.  Finally, commodities in most of their forms, especially as futures, are readily exchanged for pure money such as dollars. Since the theme of this paper is Malthusian resources, we shall focus
 on the waxing and waning of the intermediateness of commodities, and in
 particular the geolitical commodities oil and phosphate rock.

Thus industrial commodities, and especially minerals important to geopolitics like crude oil and phosphate, serve at least three major purposes in the post Bretton Woods world beyond just industrial or agricultural consumption:

(a) a hedge against increases in expected inflation in floating rate currencies, or greater uncertainties about same,

(b) for governments, protection against coercive economic sanctions by foreign governments, and

(c) for militarily strong countries, a form of wealth relatively immune from foreign attack in time of war

We will see all these factors at play during the first and second Malthusian scares.


The First Malthusian Scare

Oil "chasing the tail of gold" 
during the 1970s. (Source)
As described above, the Bretton Woods era ended between 1968 and 1971, leading to the purely floating rate regime that has prevailed from 1971 to today. Free trade in gold, which had been banned under Franklin Roosevelt, was returned to the U.S.

Shortly thereafter, in 1973-4, an event that many economists have deemed an "exogenous shock", and even a main cause of the dramatic oil price rises of the 1970s, occurred on the world stage: the Arab oil embargo of Britain and the U.S. in response to their intervention on behalf of Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Around the same time OPEC more than doubled the dollar prices it charged for its oil.  It is common but highly inaccurate to call OPEC a "monopoly cartel" at that time -- it accounted for only about 3% of U.S. oil consumption in 1967 and still only 6.7% at the end of 1973.  It had increased its pricing power from negligible to slight; it could hardly have more than doubled the price of oil on its own had not other oil-producing companies and countries been of similar mind.

One dog didn't bark: oil prices around the times of the 
Suez crisis (1956-7), in which Europe lost control of over 
half its oil supply, and the Arab Crisis (73-74), involving a 
temporary embargo that was easy to get around 
by trading through cutout countries.
By sharp contrast, the Suez Crisis of 1956-7, which produced a much more dramatic and longer-lasting impact on the world's oil supply chains -- Europe suddenly lost military control over more than half of the oil it consumed to a recently independent and hostile Egypt, never to gain it back -- was followed by a far smaller and more ephemeral percentage increase in oil prices.

Due to the increased inflation expectations, oil producers conserved on pumping, despite rising prices and oil consumers stockpiled despite the rising prices of funding those purchases. The reverse would happen throughout the decreases in inflation expectations and resulting long decline in commodity prices during most of the 1980s and 1990s.  Oil producers kept pumping beyond the needs of the industrial market to hasten the drawdown of their depreciating reservoirs.

What the voter saw: U.S. consumer 
price index 1973-81.
But during the first Malthusian scare, U.S. and European entities began stockpiling oil and other strategic commodities. For example U.S. oil imports from the Middle East, which had been only about 3% of consumption in 1967 when relations were friendly, had increased to 6.7% by 1973 even though relations had become hostile. and nominal prices of that oil had risen. Meanwhile U.S. oil producers were pumping less oil, choosing to keep relatively more of it in the ground rather than sell it for cheapening dollars.The Second Malthusian Scare 

As in the 1970s, the
commodity rise during the second Malthusian scare of roughly 2004-14 was often sharp and concurrently effected the vast majority of commodities. After substantial advances in both real estate and commodity
prices the previous several years, during 2007 central banks cut rates and
raise money supplies to fight collapsing real estate prices. These efforts
fueled sharp increases in inflation expectations. Nominal and CPI-adjusted prices
of fossil fuels, precious metals, industrial metals, lumber, fibers,
fertilizers, grains, oilseeds, dairy, and livestock all skyrocketed during
2007, hitting record highs in nominal prices.  The market’s endless search for stores of
value independent of the vagaries of fiat currencies had switched from real estate on which easy loans were defaulting to
commodities that could be held more securely.  This time the most (in)famous stockpiler was China, planning for the rapid economic growth it expected in the decades ahead.


Also as in the 1970s, the individual components
of this broad-range trend were attributed to a stupendous variety of
idiosyncratic causes -- the co-occurrence of which all driving prices in the
same direction at the same time was astronomically improbable. The only reasonable attribution would be to related common causes – which, given that there
had been no sudden worldwide industrial boom, had to have been monetary causes.

Warnings about peak oil, peak phosphorous, etc. issued from all the major media outlets and science journals.  In Silicon Valley, a boom in "green technology" startups and investments ensued -- resulting later in mostly bankrupt companies.  

As I wrote at the time:
It is a gross violation of Occam's Razor to attribute the recent very 
broad-based run-up in dollar commodity prices primarily to the plethora 
of disparate causes to which they have been attributed: "peak oil", the 
war in Iraq, ethanol subsidies displacing food, and so on. Rises in 
industrial demand, increases in the costs of transporting commodities 
due to high oil prices, and so on explain only a small fraction of the 
rise in other commodity prices, and do not explain at all why precious 
metal prices have increased alongside those of other commodities. 
Occam's Razor points us, as it did to wise investors and economists in 
the 1970s, to the one kind of commodity all these other commodities have
 in common: the currencies they are priced in...
...demand for the oft-dreaded but ill-understood "hoarding" and 
"speculation", that is storing extra commodities (often off-the-books, 
or at least not in the officially measured warehouses) and the purchase 
of extra commodity futures and other commodity derivatives to hedge 
transactions based on government currencies, will remain strong as long 
as the Federal Reserve continues to inflate the dollar supply, and as 
long as many developing countries continue to link their currencies to 
this dollar. Commodity prices in dollars will level off, and then move 
back down close to historical trends based largely on just industrial 
consumption, if or when the Fed stops increasing the supply of dollars 
faster than the demand for dollars. 
As it transpired, neither the Malthusian worries nor, as of this writing, the inflation expectations proved justified.  The run-up in oil helped fund the fracking revolution, a technology which defied peak oil theory:

Theory: peak oil diagram after Hubbert.  Alleged to 
apply at all scales not just to individual wells.

Reality: not as simple as theory

Oil thus demonstrated itself as a poorer monetary substitute than gold: being a much more novel commodity than gold, its production is subject to substantially more likelihood of technological invention and geological discovery.   
Fracking in one diagram

This possibility, which had not been sufficiently priced into oil before fracking, makes oil supply less reliably scarce than that of gold, rendering it less useful as a store of value, reducing the monetary premium of the oil price over oil as it would be priced if it were just an industrial commodity. Secondly, of course, is the direct effect of fracking on the supply curve in lowering oil prices.  The effects of the fracking revolution are amplified because more than just the Econ-101 supply curve shift is reducing oil prices due to fracking: oil's monetary premium is being eroded at the same time. Oil had been a monetary bubble which is now bursting.

If you are Saudi Arabia or Iraq sitting on large reservoirs of easily extracted oi, your alternative to treating oil as a store of value, if you still don't trust the Western powers, is to pump even more and trade the proceeds for gold (and also pay off some foolishly acquired debts) -- which is what we now see happening. Thus, paradoxically (to those who analyze oil as no more than an industrial commodity) oil producing countries pump more oil despite much lower oil prices. They are selling oil from their "oil warehouse" below the sands of the Middle East in exchange for gold, which due to the fracking revolution has reasserted its superiority as a trust-minimized currency over oil. If "money is the bubble that doesn't pop", partial money, i.e. Mengerian intermediate commodities, create bubbles that sometimes do pop, as the desirability of various commodities for their monetary properties, especially their value as a store of value relatively immune from political interdiction, waxes and wanes.


As much good news as bad: the two Malthusian scares 
sandwich an era when inflation-commodity prices fell by about the same 
amount that they rose during the two scares combined. (And they have 
fallen further since 2010). The explanation of "tight money" vs. "easy 
money" is pertinent but oversimplified, as one would expect an 
attempt to explain a theory in chart labels to be...

Conclusion

During the Bretton Woods era the U.S. dollar, pegged to gold at $35 an ounce, served the entire free world as a common and reliable standard of value.  The transition from Bretton Woods to floating rates left the world with no common and reliable standard of value by which to guarantee future real returns on contracts or investments.  As a result the most commonly traded commodities, and especially geopolitical commodities such as oil and phosphates, became Mengerian intermediate commodities, with a price premium as a store of value that waxed and waned with the weighted expected inflation among the world's various floating currencies. As a result, the prices of these commodities are much more volatile since 1970 than they were during the Bretton Woods era. Epochs of increasing inflation expectations have led to rapid, broad-based commodity price rises, where the market gives out false signals of scarcity, leading to Malthusian anxieties and panics that we face a future of diminishing natural resources. This in turn has fueled a major and sustainable growth in green ideology since the 1960s.

It's no longer debatable that commodity supplies in general pose few limits to long-term industrial growth, nor, except in the special case of phosphates, any significant limits that cannot eventually be innovated past by substituting newer more abundant materials for scarcer older ones.  To obtain all the commodities we have consumed in history has involved barely scratching he surface of one planet. Scratching out somewhat more each upcoming decade and century into the foreseeable future is, in terms of that supply, by and large sustainable. A far more debatable proposition is to how much environmental impacts will or should limit industrial growth -- for example, what is or should be our ability to continue pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? That is a debate this paper shall leave for another day.

 Part 2: Cluster development preserves California’s landscape


                  Part 2: Cluster development preserves California’s landscape
                  

February 19th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.

One of the most essential parts of California Forever’s proposal to build a new city is the idea of clustered development, which is the #1 most impactful strategy we can adopt for environmental conservation while also giving humans places to live. 

Clustered development concentrates the footprint of a city in a small area, leaving the majority of the land untouched. Sadly, it’s an underrated strategy in US environmental policy. We focus on designing buildings to be as energy-efficient as possible while forgetting that if they’re located on the periphery of a sparse community that requires everyone to get in a car in order to get there and involves the bulldozing of many more acres of nature for its development.
The city center of Siena, Italy is home to 30,000 people. It is the same size as a single Houston highway interchange .
Replacing California’s sprawling development pattern
The focus on clustered development is a breath of fresh air compared to the dominant sprawl development pattern in California over the past few decades, which consumes vast swathes of California’s stunning landscape. All you need to do is drive to the edge of an urban area, and you’ll see new tract development spreading out in all directions.

The reason development in California tends to eat up so much of our state’s beautiful land is tragically ironic. Well-meaning environmental advocates have created limits to how much we can build in our existing urban areas, with the thought that this will lower the impact of humans on California’s environment. 

But people still need places to live, so instead of making the problem go away, these limits to development within existing built-up areas have simply pushed that development to the fringes, where it uses up land that otherwise would have stayed open and preserved.

Pricing people out and pushing them to places like Arizona, where temperatures can be 110℉+ for weeks at a time, is not saving the environment!Pushing development to the fringes also results in longer commutes, which in turn increases pollution. There is a strong correlation between higher density and lower vehicle miles traveled (VMT): as cities become denser, people drive less. It’s not rocket science — when destinations are closer together, walking, biking, or public transportation become more attractive and feasible, and these have a much smaller environmental footprint than driving.
Environmental regulations in California are often the strictest along the coast, where the climate is more favorable and economic opportunities are more abundant. As a result, developers are pushed to build in inland areas like Fresno and Bakersfield. These places are not only far away from major job centers, exacerbating inequality, but also require air conditioning to be liveable in large parts of the year.

As the housing crisis in California has worsened, it has even pushed people beyond those inland regions to more affordable states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Unfortunately, these areas have a much higher carbon footprint than California due to their hotter climates. A temperate coastal region like California is one of the most sustainable climates to live in in the US, and pushing people out by limiting development is the opposite of helping the environment.
Car use declines with density. It declines particularly rapidly from <2,000 to >3,000 residents per mi². (Planetizen)

The specifics of California Forever’s planThe ballot initiative goes into detail about what this clustered development will mean in practice. Although California Forever bought over 60,000 acres of land, the initiative proposes using just 17,500 acres for the development of the city. (For comparison, Golden Gate Park is about 1,000 acres and San Francisco is about 30,000 acres.) The remaining acreage would be used for wind farms, solar farms, agriculture, and open space.
Clustering development allows us to preserve more of the natural and agricultural space around itWhen development isn’t clustered, it consumes far more natural and agricultural landOf the space devoted to the city, over 20% (4,000+ acres) will be dedicated to parks, trails, community gardens, and other open spaces. This commitment to green space is not just a bonus; it's a core aspect of the clustered development approach that prioritizes environmental preservation.

The Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan was a key reference for California Forever when selecting the location. Following those guidelines, they located the city in the part of the county with the lowest ecological value, and made a special point to steer clear of ecologically sensitive areas like Suisun Marsh, Jepson Prairie, and Cache Slough. 

The impact on agriculture, a vital part of California's economy and landscape, will also be minimal. The plan was specifically designed to avoid Solano County’s prime agricultural land. According to California Forever, the entire community is located on non-prime farmland, and as a result, the proposal displaces less than 2% of the county's agricultural value: Solano County as a whole produces roughly $385 million of agricultural output per year, and the entire 17,500 acres used for the new community produce only about $6 million out of that $385 million, i.e. less than 2%. 
A photo from the area where the new city has been proposedAn illustration from California Forever's website depicting the type of community they plan to buildTo put all this into perspective, this level of preservation in new development is almost unheard of. Most developers in California squeeze out as much usage of their land, because they’re limited by how much they can build on any given acre. California Forever identified this structural problem and suggested a novel solution: let’s change the rules so that we can build more using less space — this will allow us to keep more land for renewable energy, agriculture, and open space than if development is forced to spread out in all directions.

My hope is that California Forever can serve as a model for how clustered development can work in California, showcasing how we can preserve the natural landscape and reduce our carbon footprints. Hopefully then this approach can spread throughout the state and save our beautiful landscape!

 Why is pop culture obsessed with battles between good and evil?


                  Why is pop culture obsessed with battles between good and evil?
                  

February 2nd, 2018
This essay from Aeon makes the observation that folktales weren't always about fighting for a noble value. Rather they were just about getting what you want, without framing actions in a strong moral light:
Stories from an oral tradition never have anything like a modern good guy or bad guy in them,  despite their reputation for being moralising. In stories such as Jack and the Beanstalk or Sleeping Beauty, just who is the good guy? Jack is the protagonist we’re meant to root for, yet he has no ethical justification for stealing the giant’s things. Does Sleeping Beauty care about goodness? Does anyone fight crime? Even tales that can be made to seem like they are about good versus evil, such as the story of Cinderella, do not hinge on so simple a moral dichotomy. In traditional oral versions, Cinderella merely needs to be beautiful to make the story work. In the Three Little Pigs, neither pigs nor wolf deploy tactics that the other side wouldn’t stoop to. It’s just a question of who gets dinner first, not good versus evil.

The situation is more complex in epics such as The Iliad, which does have two ‘teams’, as well as characters who wrestle with moral meanings. But the teams don’t represent the clash of two sets of values in the same way that modern good guys and bad guys do. Neither Achilles nor Hector stands for values that the other side cannot abide, nor are they fighting to protect the world from the other team. They don’t symbolise anything but themselves and, though they talk about war often, they never cite their values as the reason to fight the good fight. The ostensibly moral face-off between good and evil is a recent invention that evolved in concert with modern nationalism – and, ultimately, it gives voice to a political vision not an ethical one.
Greek mythology also tended not to hinge on so simple a moral dichotomy. Zeus and Hera’s rocky relationship is literally legendary, yet in all of the stories involving their marriage the audience isn’t pushed to root for one or the other. Zues is a philanderer, and Hera is jealous and vain. When Zues fell in love with Calisto, Hera turned her into a bear. When Hera lost the competition as to who was "the fairest goddess" (to Aphrodite), she started a war to punish the judge, who happened to be Paris of Troy.

These legends don’t rile moral passions like the classic Sith-Jedi, Voldemort-Harry, and Hook-Peter Pan nemeses do, but they are a more accurate portrait of life. The world is made up of people with sometimes (but not always!) competing intentions, which come down to truly difficult tradeoffs rather than a clearcut "good" vs "evil". It’s more a question of how we want to spend limited resources/prestige than about intentionally destroying or saving everything. (It’s a shame really—everything would be a lot simpler if the bad things in the world were that clear cut.)

Ancient stories tend to be more agnostic as to who wins, while modern stories tend to force you to pick a side. And usually there’s really not much of a choice.

The Aeon posts post argues that this is because the good-evil dichotomy is a useful political tool, which make sense, but it leaves me with a question: why did people only start using that tool relatively recently? Maybe it’s just a technological and scientific improvement like anything else, a technique that took time to develop. Maybe the ancient Greeks and Germanic tribes just didn’t have a good enough grasp on human psychology to recognize its power.

 Why is flaking so widespread in San Francisco?

                  Why is flaking so widespread in San Francisco?
                  

February 2nd, 2018
In an email exchange with Brian Lui, he asked me an interesting question about the rate of flaking in San Francisco:
I had a brief question too. I've read that the rate of "flaking" in San Francisco is really high, because everyone is so busy and there is so much to do. But then I thought, wouldn't that lead to an extra strong norm against flaking, because your time is too precious to get flaked on by someone? Apparently this doesn't happen and it's socially acceptable to flake. I feel really upset about that!
This is something I’ve noticed, to the extent that when I make plans with people I expect that at least half of the time those plans will change dramatically or if not be cancelled all together. And I don’t mean to just complain—I’m as big a culprit as anyone else!—but I wish this weren’t the case, because it makes scheduling difficult.

Brian’s question made me think: Why is the rate of flaking so high in San Francisco? And is it higher than in other "comparable" cities?

It’s a prisoner’s dilemma! Everyone would be better off if no one flaked, but on the margins everyone wants to be able to flake, because their thing just this once is sooo important. And so everyone flakes, and everyone’s worse off as a result.Everyone is even more connected digitally here than most other places in the world. This includes more of a tendency to treat digital and in-person interaction as fungible (people don’t literally think this is true, but they’re treated as closer than in other cultures) which makes meeting in person appear less critical to building relationships because you can just text/Slack/message them. The irony is that by making it cheap to connect with people virtually, in-person relationships are even more valuable and exclusive. The other aspect is that you can basically always depend on someone having their phone on them and checking it throughout the day, so there’s more certainty that you can change plans at a moment’s notice if need be. This is probably less true in other places where people are less hooked into their laptops and cell phones.Back in the good ‘ol days, if you made Wednesday plans with someone on Tuesday, you’d better show up on Wednesday because otherwise they wouldn’t know what happened. But now, if something comes up you can just shoot them a text and disturb their day a lot less.There’s a weird induced demand here though—because it’s so much cheaper to cancel, people just cancel all of the time, which adds up to just as much of an inconvenience if not more. Sometimes I think we’d all be better off (at least in terms of scheduling) if texting were never invented. These communication technologies are of course available elsewhere too, but here they’re more often seen as substitutes rather than complements, which makes me think that the effects I’m describing are probably stronger.The Bay Area has this weird mix of intensity but also casualness that makes it really hard to call people out on rudely cancelling plans. The intensity and extent of opportunities makes it tempting to cancel in order to do something else that’s more pressing, and the casualness pushes the other person to just accept it. It’s part of a whole trend of accepting all lifestyle choices, being easygoing, which is mostly a good thing I think, but the cost is that it seems dickish to ask someone to change their behavior, even when it truly is rude. For instance a friend of mine recently canceled plans shortly before we were supposed to meet. This was really frustrating, because I’d taken an expensive Uber to get there on time. He didn’t know that, he just assumed I was coming from my apartment, but it still was super rude. He had a good reason, but I think he would’ve been more careful if there were a norm that I’d react more strongly. Instead, I didn’t say too much. I communicated some frustration, but not to the extent I would’ve have liked, because a major value in California is to be easygoing. This ends up not being great for him either though, because later that week when were supposed to meet up again I didn’t feel so bad about taking a while to respond re making plans for the following weekend. He in turn was easygoing about it (outwardly, at least!), but both of our time ended up being wasted. By losing the social norm to hold people accountable for being rude, we find ourselves on the wrong quadrant of the prisoners’ dilemma. Maybe this is worth it by making people more comfortable with each other, but I tend to think it just creates resentment under the surface. (Again I should be clear that I’m not upset about it really, my point is just that those sorts of micro frictions are totally avoidable.)Reasons #2 and #3 tend not to apply as much to older people, and SF, especially tech and my social circles, is disproportionately young. In cities where young people interact with older ones, they probably have to conform to norms of actually showing up when they say they will. We don’t really have that conforming pressure. We do have some people who are not as used to flaking, but they’re a small enough group that they’re forced to conform to the status quo rather than to change others’ behavior. Makes me wonder what the tipping point is to be to have the opposite effect. It might also have something to do with power dynamics, i.e. just a few powerful people have to set the norm and then everyone else will follow. I suspect it’s more about the absolute ratio though, since behavior within a specific category of interactions (i.e. with high status people) doesn’t necessarily bleed into other categories (i.e. with friends and family).EDIT: Brian made a good point that status probably has something to do with it, too. "There is some sort of status thing going on: if you are powerful, you can flake more. Then people who want to appear powerful imitate them and soon everyone is flaking."

Now this is all fairly hypocritical, as I flake all of the time. I’ve been getting better at it though. It’s caused me enough frustration to be on the other side of the equation that it’s really become embarrassing when I do it to other people. I’ve found it also forces me to be more thoughtful with the way I spend my time, which is a nice side effect. I’m more selective with how I think about my time, as I really try to stick to my commitments, whereas before I was much less thoughtful about scheduling because I always had flaking in my back pocket. One effect is that I say "no" to more things now, which is uncomfortable but on net better than flaking on the person.

This does have the downside of not communicating as strongly to them that you want to spend time with them, but it’s much more respectful than wasting their time. It reminds me of a quote from this New Yorker profile of Jony Ive:
Jobs’s taste for merciless criticism was notorious; Ive recalled that, years ago, after seeing colleagues crushed, he protested. Jobs replied, "Why would you be vague?," arguing that ambiguity was a form of selfishness: "You don’t care about how they feel! You’re being vain, you want them to like you." Ive was furious, but came to agree. "It’s really demeaning to think that, in this deep desire to be liked, you’ve compromised giving clear, unambiguous feedback," he said. He lamented that there were "so many anecdotes" about Jobs’s acerbity: "His intention, and motivation, wasn’t to be hurtful."
I will say, in the past few months I’ve become close with a friend who’s exceptionally good at planning and rarely flakes. She’s wonderful for lots of other reasons too, but this makes me like her even more. I always know that when we make plans they’ll happen, which makes me really not want to flake on her and also to not do so with others. So there is hope that a few thoughtful people can tip the balance in favor of the globally optimal equilibrium. (Let’s just hope it’s an equilibrium…)#cities

 City review: A day in Bangalore

                  City review: A day in Bangalore
                  

August 2nd, 2018
I spent Friday, 9 March 2018 in Bangalore, India, the last of the cities I visited that week. Of the five, Bangalore was the one that pleasantly surprised me the most. I had never been to India before, and I prepared myself for an underdeveloped, hectic urban experience. Its infrastructure was substandard, and it was not a sparkling metropolis like Singapore or a viscerally ambitious culture like Beijing, but it had a dynamism and cosmopolitan optimism that took me by surprise. I was uncomfortable for much of the day, but I could imagine myself making a life there and becoming good friends with the people I spoke with on the street in a way that I frankly didn't expect.

Here's where I'll admit my ignorance: going in the only real thing I new about Bangalore was that it's the tech capital of the country, but I didn't compute much beyond that. I had a hazy stereotype of what Indian cities are like (likely more shaped by Slumdog Millionaire than I'd like to admit...), and while it didn't directly contradict any of that, there was so much more dynamism and sophistication than I imagined.
Accidental Wes AndersonOne of my favorite subreddits is r/AccidentalWesAnderson. Anderson is a film director whose signature style is famous for a flatness of composition, heavy symmetry, and especially dusty pastel palettes, and that subreddit collects images that "accidentally resemble a work" of his.

Bangalore could generate endless submissions to that subreddit. Every landscape, building, and detail fit the aesthetic perfectly.

Prototypical Wes Anderson shots:


A major contributor to this vibe is that Bangalore is hazy, which I assume is due to pollution. Buildings faded into the background like mountains enshrouded in a mist. It gave everything a softness that was actually quite beautiful in a way, though gross to think about. In Beijing the air was not as visibly bad but smelled a little putrid all day long, whereas in Bangalore my breathing felt fine, but my friend said that Bangalore's air was much worse for him than Beijing's and even made him feel a little sick. So 🤷‍♀️
Colorful facades and white matte stone with colored lining are also a common choices for building materials, which visually fits into the Wes Anderson aesthetic, and the wide diversity of the jungle plants add a splash of color. It's hard to capture exactly the vibe in images, but you can get an idea:
Haze through the car window as we drove in from the airportA love letter to Bangalore's trees 💌Bangalore's trees were my favorite part of the city. They were so lush and made the experience of walking in Bangalore quite enjoyable despite the heat and the otherwise crumbling pedestrian infrastructure. I didn't capture as many photos as I would've liked, so here are a few I grabbed from a Google image search:Fun fact about the diversity of trees in Bangalore:DIVERSITY Bangalore’s street trees have a healthy diversity, with the most dominant species constituting less than 10% of total population. By contrast in Syracuse, USA, three most common species constitute almost two-thirds of street trees; in Chicago, four most common species comprise two-thirds of the entire population Bangalore compares favourably to highlypopulated cities like Mexico City, where four most common species constitute 49% of trees In highly-populated Asian cities like Bangkok, one species constitutes over 40% of trees.


Moving around the city
I dreaded the infamous Indian heat and humidity, and my heart sank upon checking the weather report that morning: high of 93°F and low of 79°F, with 36% humidity. The heat was oppressive when walking in the sun, no question, but leafy trees protected most places I went.

The streets were hectic, but in a bustling, happy sort of way. Jakarta was similarly busy, but it felt much more anonymous and uncaring, whereas in Bangalore I felt like I was part of a community of people who all somewhat knew each other. A few specific differences may explain this delta. For one, the streets I wandered were much more narrow so the traffic didn't get to such high speeds, and motorcycles did not dominate the roads as much. Also there were more people walking around, whereas in Jakarta the street life felt relegated to just lower class people who couldn't afford to be shuttled around everywhere.

The people watching on the street was really top-notch!Interesting placement for an ad


I often found myself stuck walking in the street. Sidewalks taken up by motorcycles, trash, and construction materials. Not great, but not terrible because lots of other people were doing the same and it felt like pedestrians were welcome to do that. I'd still prefer good pedestrian infrastructure to begin with of course.

The streets were hectic, and the infrastructure was falling apart or nonexistent in most places.
Bangalore’s trees and human-scale streets made up for some of its shortfalls, though.I'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to ride the Namma Metro. I did catch a ride on a bus at the beginning of the day, and it was a very pleasant experience. It was efficient, easy to use (despite my not speaking the local language), felt very safe, and was incredibly cheap—only 10 rupees, about 15 cents in USD for a trip across town!

Most of the roads don't have painted lanes, so vehicles just weave all over the place rather than staying in single file. I imagine this must wreck the throughput...Labor is super cheap in Bangalore, and that is visible at every turn. The guy standing at the door of the bus is a sort of doorman and alerting system. This was true in Jakarta, too.
Bus ticket cost 10 rupees, about 15 cents in USD.

The traffic was quite unbearable, but I prefer to walk anyways so I didn't get stuck in it too much. (A friend said he spent half the day shuttling to-and-from meetings, though!) Everyone honks constantly. It felt like it wasn't out of anger like the way we honk in the States though, more as a way to say "Hellooooo! I'm here!!!". It was kind of charming actually, though extremely noisy and headache-inducing.

Navigating the streets on foot was surprisingly difficult. Many places were unexpectedly blocked off, and it was not clear from the map how to traverse certain parts of the city. I'd planned to walk for 45 minutes and then grab lunch in a particular area, but I kept getting lost and was only about halfway there by the time  I'd planned to eat. I decided it was a good chance to try the famous rickshaws that I saw all over the place but then made the mistake of trying to call one via Uber rather than flagging it down directly on the street. The app continually assigned me a driver and then canceled, so in the end I just got a normal car. Here are a few shots of the streets as we drove across town:In India, all of the license plates for cars registered in a particular state begin with the same two letters. This is a silly design decision, because the first two letters are the ones you’d like to most immediately differentiate based off of! In Bangalore’s case, it’s in Karnataka, so all license plates begin with KA. This means you have to move your eyes to the third character in the string before you can start differentiating. I’m sure locals are used to this, but it just adds unnecessary interpretive burden.
During the day, walking through the streets felt quite safe though frustrating and inefficient. But at the end of the day, I had one of the most stressful walking experiences I've ever had in my life. It was about an hour's walk back to the hotel, and I figured I'd go at dusk so it wouldn't be so hot, plus I'd get to see the city shutting down for the night. This was not a good idea. The first half of the walk was gorgeous as the sun set in the background. It was peaceful to see people returning from work, and the light filtering through the trees was stunning.

But then suddenly it got very dark, and I found myself embroiled in a mess of traffic, garbage, small trash fires, and feral cows, and the path forward took me through really sketchy alleyways filled with what appeared to be illicit activity. I pushed through for a little while, and then I realized not only did I have almost no control over the situation but that it was obvious to everyone around me that I was a bit lost and probably carrying a lot of cash. While I was probably mostly safe, I was just asking for trouble trying to push through these unfamiliar neighborhoods by myself, and it was quite likely I'd get even more lost than earlier that day, so I decided to call another car to just get back to the hotel as quickly as possible.

Bangalore at dus


Feral cows! Cows eating garbage in the middle of a major arterial was one of the biggest shockers of the day for me. Wish I'd gotten more of a close up—they were eating trash and wretched looking, some with gaping wounds in their hides. Visibly sick. They just chilled in the middle of the road and drivers drove around them wherever they got in the way. Quite a sight.

Cosmopolitan and optimistic (and lunch)
I spoke with a few people through the day, and all of them seemed very optimistic, educated people with opportunities ahead of them. Of course there's selection bias because I could only speak to folks who knew English, but nearly everyone I came across to had a strong working proficiency of English, which was surprising to me.

I had a delicious lunch at Hasini Foods, where I met a great guy named Kaviraj who was running the place. Given my escapades (i.e. getting lost) earlier that morning, I arrived at the restaurant very late, so the restaurant was nearly empty. We struck up a conversation, and I told Kaviraj that I was not really familiar with the food so he should pick everything for me. He came out with an amazing platter of food served on a banana leaf and described everything to me. It was delicious! One of my favorite meals I ate on the entire trip. I just wish I better remembered what everything was.


Let's see how much of this I can remember... the white stuff was yogurt with sugar on top (yum!), I don't quite remember what the yellow mush was but it was sweet and reminded me of something else I've eaten, and the fried veggies tasted a bit like the way hip SF restaurants prepare Brussels sprouts but the green stuff was chilies I think because they were a bit spice.

... yeah I don't think I'll cut it with my job as a food critic unfortunately. It was good, and I'll leave it at that!


I pulled out my laptop to get some work done. Kaviraj, who had gone back behind the cash register to do some work, started laughing a little. He said he was extremely impressed by my typing speed and that if I worked at his company I'd be "king of the office".

Kaviraj and I talked for a while, and he explained that this was actually a friend's restaurant and he was only working there for the day because his friend had to go visit family. Full-time he works at a financial software company nearby, and he went to Basaveswar Commerce College Bagalkot.
.
I noticed he had two phones on the table, one Android and one iPhone, and asked him why. He blushed and told me that the iPhone was "a status symbol for the girls", but the Android is the "reality". He explained that the iPhone doesn't really work, because it doesn't have service outside of the core city, but he still wanted to have it. We then exchanged phone numbers (I guess that iPhone did its job!), and he was very surprised to learn that I also use WhatsApp.

Selfie with Kaviraj!After lunch, I went to a cafe called Dialogues, whose motto is "dream like a bohemian, work like a boss".  It felt like I stepped into a Berlin hipster coworking spot when I finally found the place, though finding the space was surprisingly difficult. It was on the top floor and roof of a mostly unmarked office building, so I wasn't sure I was in the right place walking up an unfamiliar staircase.
Dialogues Cafe had an interesting pricing structure: you only pay for the time you’re there, not for wifi, food, or drinks. They have a little cafe where you can get all you want under that all-included price. I was stuffed from my Andhra Bhojanam lunch so didn’t get anything, but it looked good.


.

I felt this throughout my time in Bangalore, but Dialogues really hit it home: the city’s residents felt very cosmopolitan, educated, forward-thinking, and friendly, but stuck with crumbling infrastructure. It was like talking to someone with a lot of mental energy who’s stuck in an old persons’ body.

It was especially interesting to compare it to my experience in Jakarta earlier that week. The per capita GDP in Bangalore is $5,051 (as of 2014) while in Jakarta it is $17,374 (as of 2017), so I fully expected it to feel much further behind in most dimensions, but that was not the case at all. It felt very forward-looking and cosmopolitan, and to a much greater extent than Jakarta, despite being much poorer on a GDP basis.


Hectic streets, gorgeous oases
The next day, I spent the morning before my flight back to the States in the courtyard at the hotel. It was one of the most serene places I've ever been.

Birds chirping, water bubbling, and a nice breeze to whisk away the heat... it felt like a scene out of a Rudyard Kipling story. Fantastic way to end a long week of travel :)

Uh oh, it looks like your embed code is broken.

One of the classiest hotels I've ever stayed in!

 Part 1: The story so far of California Forever


                  Part 1: The story so far of California Forever
                  

February 18th, 2024
A new city has been proposed in California, and I’ve never been more captivated by a vision for the future of my home state in my lifetime. This post is part of a series I’m writing about this bold proposal.

California Forever was founded by Jan Sramek in 2017 as a way to create the missing economic engine for Solano County while helping to solve the region’s growing housing crisis in a scalable, financially self-supporting way. He began pitching the project to wealthy Californians who were committed to the long-term health and success of the state. 

Jan described it as an investment that would achieve these goals and also could make money long-term if it succeeded. This resonated with people like Laurene Powell Jobs, Mike Moritz, John and Patrick Collison, Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, and Reid Hoffman, who ended up investing a combined hundreds of millions of dollars to the project.
A photo from the area where the new city has been proposedA map showing the location for the proposed new cityOver the next 6 years, California Forever bought over 60,000 acres of land in Solano County. (This is a lot of land; for comparison, Golden Gate Park is about 1,000 acres and San Francisco is about 30,000 acres.) They made these purchases without telling people in advance what their ideas were for the land, similar to how Disney purchased the land for Disney World. They knew that if they announced the plan upfront, the land prices would spike and the project would no longer be possible.

As the years went on and California Forever bought more and more land, neighbors grew curious and, later, concerned about who was behind the project. Farmers were selling at prices that part of the county had never seen before, with many of them making out with millions of dollars, and eventually the proximity to Travis Air Force Base made people concerned that perhaps some foreign adversary was buying the land.

In summer 2023, the team was preparing for a public launch in the fall. But before California Forever could make their planned announcement, the project leaked – the start of a rocky rollout to the public. It’s clear to me that the land assembly could never have happened if they had told the whole world what they were doing in advance. It’s also clear to me why some Solano residents would feel suspicious about an entity that purchased so much land quietly, and why California Forever would need to make up for that.CEO Jan Sramek at a December town hall in Rio Vista, a town neighboring the proposed new city (The Reporter)
Over the following months, California Forever went into community engagement mode — talking to people in the county, setting up a community advisory committee, organizing town halls, and hosting meetings with electeds and community groups. These conversations became input into the plan for the new city. "To make sure those programs reflect input from all residents, we need your advice on what causes to prioritize in these community benefit programs," said a blog post from late 2023 that outlined some of the themes they had heard Solano voters say were priorities for them, such as down payment assistance, childcare, and education and training.

On January 17, after incorporating input from Solano stakeholders, California Forever announced the ballot initiative that will go in front of voters in November. The proposed legislation is called the East Solano Homes, Jobs, and Clean Energy Initiative. If passed, its contents would become legally binding. Here are key aspects of the project as spelled out in the initiative:The city would use just 17,500 acres, or about a quarter of the total land that California Forever owns. 4,000 of those acres would be used for parks, trails, urban ecological habitat, community gardens, and other types of open space.Neighborhoods would be centered around local shopping streets and schools, and designed so that families can live within a short walk for most daily needs.The community is designed to provide a range of transportation alternatives to cars, including walking, biking, and frequent transit service.The initiative describes 10 guarantees to ensure the plan will benefit citizens all across Solano County, such as tying the new city’s ability to grow to the creation of 15,000 new jobs and $400 million in downpayment assistance. (I’ll dive deeper into these guarantees in a later post in the series.)
The company made some minor modifications in a revised initiative submitted on January 29th. Travis Air Force base still had some concerns about the impact of the project on their flight operations, so on February 14, California Forever modified the plan based on this input to shift uses farther from the base. In response, Travis Airforce Base said that the amended initiative will work for them, allowing them to continue their full mission. (I’ll dive deeper into this topic in a later post in the series.)

The next step is for California Forever to collect approximately 13,500 signatures to place the initiative on the ballot in November 2024 (10% of Solano residents who voted in the last gubernatorial election). Then, it’ll go to a vote of Solano residents in November 2024, and they will decide what happens next.

Argentina On Two Steaks A Day

The classic beginner's mistake in Argentina is to neglect the first steak of the day.  You will be tempted to just peck at it or even skip it altogether, rationalizing that you need to save yourself for the much larger steak later that night.  But this is a false economy, like refusing to drink water in the early parts of a marathon.  That first steak has to get you through the  afternoon and half the night, until the restaurants begin to open at ten; the first steak is what primes your system to digest large quantities of animal protein, and it's the first steak that buffers the sudden sugar rush of your afternoon ice cream cone.    The midnight second steak might be more the glamorous one, standing as it does a good three inches off the plate, but all it has to do is get you up and out of the restaurant and into bed (for the love of God, don't forget to drink water).  
The afternoon steak is the workhorse steak, the backbone of the day.   It's the steak that gets you around the city, ensures a successful nap, steers you into the bar and (most importantly) gives you the mental clarity to choose the right cut of meat in the restaurant that night.    Misorder the first steak and you will either find yourself losing steam by eight o'clock, when no restaurant is open, or scampering to find an awkward third bridge steak, to tide you over until dinner.
All you need to know about the quality of pasture in the pampas is that cows  went feral in Argentina.    You can still see them grazing pretty much anywhere there is a horizontal patch of grass, all now firmly back in the hand of man, but still with a happy grassy glint in their eye.   This most docile, placid, and passive of large herbivores stepped off the boat, took one nibble at the pampas  and made a run for it.  It knew that it wanted to spend the rest of its life eating the pampas grass, without outside interference.   And the settlers, once they caught some of the early escapees, began to feel the same way about the beef. 

Eating steaks in Argentina feels like joining a cult.  You find yourself leaning on friends to come visit, and writing YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND in all caps  more often than feels comfortable.   Argentine beef really is extraordinary.   Almost all of this has to do with how the cows are raised.  There are no factory feedlots in Argentina; the animals still eat pampas grass their whole lives, in open pasture, and not  the chicken droppings and feathers mixed with corn that pass for animal feed in the United States.  Since this is the way of life a cow was  designed for, it is not necessary to pump the animal full of antibiotics.  The meat is leaner, healthier and more flavorful than that of corn-fed cattle.  It has fewer calories, contains less cholesterol, and tastes less mushy and waterlogged than American meat.   And the cows spend their lives out grazing in the field, not locked into some small pen.   You can taste the joy.   
When the meat is cooked, it is roasted in thick pieces over open coals by obsessive meat chefs who have been cooking meat all their lives, for other people who have been eating meat all their lives, in a country that takes its meat extremely seriously.   You are not likely to be disappointed.
Steaks here are ridiculous - not so much in diameter, since they rarely overhang the plate by more than an inch or two - but in thickness, having roughly the proportions of an American canned ham.   But what the Argentines have really mastered is flavor.  Strange cuts of meat that would be ground into flavorless paste up north come to your table here infused with a delicious texture and flavor, provided they are cooked right.  And they are invariably cooked right.    The waiters are solicitous about asking (in English) how you want your meat done, but if you let them make the call, you get a two-inch thick of meat that transitions seamlessly from carbon to bright pink and back.    
 
As you would expect, there is a forbidding amount of terminology around beef-eating - bife de chorizo, asado de bife, churrascos, [...], lomo, vaco, bife de costilla, ojo de bife, various more exotic portions of the animal.    However the basic principles are simple.  Meat is prepared in two ways, either on a parrilla (charcoal grill) or an asador (a system of iron crucifixes circling an open fire).   The crucifix shape is suggestive and amusing.  An excellent essay on Argentine history by Martín Caparrós may give a clue to its origin:
Juan Díaz de Solís, a Sevillian and a gentleman, arrived in the Freshwater Sea in February of 1516, when none of this existed yet.  He voyaged in three ships, as is fitting, and when some shameless natives made him a signal of welcome, he readily leaped onto the shore with his cross and his sword, only to land without further ceremony on the coals of a banquet: he was to be the main course.
His companions, who watched him slowly tranformed into a dish from the boat, then told the world of those who bury their dead that Argentine history had begun as an asado of their captain, skin and all.
Surely Solís was wearing one of those crucifixes that shows Jesus actually hanging from the cross.   It must have been a simple mistake on the part of the natives, who saw him as a friendly gift from the visitors on the boat, complete with a serving suggestion suspended around his neck.   In any case, you will now see crucified lambs and calves in the front window of many a larger parrilla, roasting for hours in front of unfazed diners.
At dinnertime, meat is served in a state of nature, which means you don't get any default potatoes, salads, or side dishes - not even a sprig of parsley.  The Argentine steak stands alone, towering three inches over the plate, its edges  hanging delectably over the sides of its silver platter.   Daytime steaks may be more coy.  While the parsley sprig as garnish is unknown in Argentina, you will sometimes encounter a fried egg, an olive, or a strip of pickled red pepper, sometimes even a combination of all three:

This gorgeous specimen is called a lomito; it's a standard lunchtime steak, clearly so thin that the Argentines are embarrassed to send it out into the world without a protective wrapping of ham and cheese.    An American who didn't know better might greet the lomito as an old dinnertime friend - the choice sirloin - but it bears about as much resemblance to a full Argentine steak as a rubber duck does to a battleship.   
Steaks come with a condiment called chimichurri, which is intermediate on the condiment spectrum between salsa and Worcestershire sauce, and can appear in any viscosity from liquid to little diced cubes.  Chimichurri is made from garlic, hot peppers, oregano, parsley and vinegar, in varying proportions.  Some of the best I've had resembles pesto, with barely any hot pepper and thick bergs of garlic; other chimichurri is much spicier and red in color.  It is there to help you - something about the sauce helps the steak go down without fuss - and you should let it do its job.  The same goes for Argentine wine; it is excellent and designed to get you safely through the large portions of beef.
There is a darker side, too, to Argentine condiments, and it is called salsa golf, the unholy alliance of ketchup and mayonnaise.  This will sneak up on you when you least expect it, including in eight-star restaurants and the most delicate of seafood dishes.  Any trip to an Argentine supermarket should give you fair warning: you can find yogurt, for example, in little containers ranging up to about 200 mL in size, but mayonnaise is sold in foil bags (bags!) of up to two liters in size. These are great fun to drop off your balcony.
The Argentine meat obsession is intense but completely democratic.  Steak is a staple food here, and you don't have to contend with Peter Lugar-style snobbishness.   You are dealing with a food of the people.   Argentina is number one in world beef consumption, weighing in at 65 kilograms (about twelve steaks) per person per year, half again as much as Americans (!) eat.   There are amusing  reminders of this everywhere.  The one-touch settings on the microwave oven in my kitchen are marked:HamChopped meatChicken (whole)PorkBeef (rare)Beef (medium)Beef (well done)As you might expect, vegetarians will have a somewhat rough time here.  For most people in Argentina, a vegetarian is something you eat.  One's diet will accordingly lean heavily on pastas, gnocchi, salads, and (for the less squeamish ) fish.  Vegans will not survive in Argentina.  However, even egg, milk and cheese-loving vegetarians should be careful not to get cocky.  Two vegetarians have visited me here during my stay, and from both I had to listen to many glowing words about the quality of Argentine fries, unable due to my impeccable upbringing to ask what they thought it was that made the fries taste so wonderful, or why they looked so deliciously yellow.  On even the most innocent box of crackers, in the slot where you would normally expect to find "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil", it reads simpy "beef tallow".   The homemade cookies bought in the minimarket downstairs taste of steak.

It should be no surprise that the land of beef also has excellent milk and butter.  The milk comes in plastic bags that would give any American marketing department a heart attack.  They proudly advertise "GUARANTEED 100% BRUCELLOSIS AND HOOF-AND-MOUTH FREE".  One brand even brags that its bacteria count *never* exceeds 100,000 per mL, and prints daily statistics to prove it (only 82,000 bacteria/mL on Monday! mmm!).    Meanwhile, the butter here either has a different name than in the rest of Latin America ("manteca" usually means "lard" ), or else Argentine lard is the best I have ever tasted.
You might think that fruits and vegetables would get short shrift in this animal paradise, but they are actually delicious.  Tomatoes, for example,  have odor, flavor, and are colored red, an intriguing novelty.  You can get excellent salads in any restaurant, although just like with the steaks, you get only what you ask for.  Celery salad is a bowl of celery, with nothing else; carrot salad is a bowl of shredded carrots.   You need to be explicit, and you need to be firm in rejecting Mazola in favor of olive oil as a dressing.   Most places offer it, but some waiters have the superstitious Argentine fear of seasoning and will try to dissuade you.
There is a strange duality to dining in Argentina.  By every measure the food  is wonderful, yet foreigners who have been here for a while will get a strange, glazed look when you try to rave to them about the cuisine.  After you've spent some time here, you realize this is because the entire country operates off of a single master menu:

With any order from the master menu comes the Bread Basket, which should be treated as you would treat a basket of wax fruit, that is, as a purely decorative ornament.  It is considered bad form to actually eat anything from Bread Basket, as this will force the restaurant staff to send someone down into the bread cellar for a replacement roll before placing it on the next table.
In fact, you won't find good bread anywhere in Argentina.  You can buy day-old baguette segments in a plastic sack, or else purchase the large sheets of white American-style bread used to make their triangular canapes (sandwiches de miga).  The latter are actually punched out of the bread sheets like cookies from rolled dough - I would not be surprised to see miga bread being sold on a giant roller, paper-towel style.

Other dangers lurk in the Argentine pantry.   Worst and most puzzling in a country settled by Italians is the horrible ground coffee.   Most cafés and restaurants serve  good espresso, but you are in the wilderness as soon as you try to find something you can brew at home.  The idea of purchasing beans to grind seems to be a great novelty - it took several days of hunting to find both a grinder and something to put in it.  Grocery store coffee is inevitably sold pre-ground and roasted with sugar, giving it a dark color and the taste and aroma of burnt socks.
 It's possible that coffee, like Argentine yogurt, is just meant as a delivery mechanism for sugar. The sugar cubes here are the size of Lego bricks, and when you order an espresso you are given three packets of sugar the size of a small wallet.   Every pharmacy has an aisle devoted to artificial sweeteners, for those who must do without, and there is a general inability to imagine a dessert that does not make your teeth hurt.    Items are preventatively glazed with sugar whenever there is be the slightest doubt as to whether they are supposed to be sweet or savory; this is what prevents the otherwise excellent Argentine croissants (medialunas) from being the king of breakfasts. 
There is a more serious kind of confectionary panic that goes beyond glazing, and it brings us to the true dark side of Argentine cooking.  I am talking about dulce de leche.
Dulce de leche is a culinary cry for help.  It says "save us, we are baffled and alone in the kitchen, we don't know what to do for dessert and we're going to  boil condensed milk and sugar together until help arrives".   This cloying dessert tar is so impossibly sweet that  you wish you were ten years old again, just so you could actually enjoy it.   It is everywhere.  There is a special dulce de leche shelf in the supermarket dairy case, and the containers go up to a liter in size.  Even the churros are stuffed with it - the churros, Montresor!   For anyone who has had pastries in Europe, the added horror is that dulce de leche is identical in color, texture and consistency to a number  of much less sweet, tasty fillings, like the   earthy chestnut material the French call crème de marrons, or the tart kind of plum butter popular in Eastern European  bakeries.   You see a thick layer of dark brown jam-like material and think, this couldn't possibly be caramel, there's just too much of it.  And so worldliness leads you to great giant bites and then disaster.
Thank God, therefore, for the ice cream.  When the Italians came here at the start of the century, they took one swig of the fine pampas milk and knew what they had to do.  The ice cream in Buenos Aires is easily the best I have ever eaten, and the parlors that serve it are everywhere.  The secret seems to be an insistence on making it from scratch in each heladeria, since the only remotely similar ice cream I've tasted was the kind our chemistry department in college used to make from liquid nitrogen in its annual bid to attract new majors.   Liquid nitrogen ice cream (recipe: heavy cream, walnuts, liquid nitrogen, sugar.  Stir) is delicious because the ice crystals it forms are so very small; this also makes the ice cream melt very fast.  The same is true for Argentine ice cream; there is no guar gum to contend with, when you get a cone you have to work fast.

I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out  how meals work in Argentina, and they remain a mystery to me.  Dinner is clear enough:  people tend to go to restaurants beginning at ten o'clock (for those with small children), with the main rush around eleven, and dinner is  pretty much over at one or so in the morning.  And breakfast - or rather, its absence - follows as a logical consequence of eating a steak the size of a beagle at midnight.   But I have yet to figure out whether people eat some kind of meal in the afternoon, and if so, when.   Wander into any bistro or restaurant between eleven and six and you will be served a delicious lunch-sized meal, but you are likely to be the only person there, with the waiter mopping floors in the corner and the parrilla stacked with raw meat for the midnight dinner rush.
I've come to think the culprit in the missing Argentine lunch scene is yerba mate. 
What Tim Horton's is to Canada, mate is to Argentina - a national obsession whose appeal is inexplicable to outsiders.  Where the ignorant foreigner may see just another kind of herbal tea (yerba mate is a very unassuming shrub that grows in the northern parts of the country)  the Argentine sees a taste treat of unimaginable subtlety, and a tonic for all his problems.  The Wikipedia article on proper mate preparation should give you a warning of the level of obsessiveness attainable here (the Urugayans are even worse).   To the virgin palate, mate tastes like green tea mixed with grass clippings.  The beverage is traditionally drunk out of a little gourd, through a metal straw called a bombilla, with hot (but not boiling!!) water poured into it (without wetting the surface!! clockwise!!) from a thermos.   What distinguishes mate from coffee and tea is the social context - two or more people share a gourd, with a designated pourer in charge of refilling it with hot water after each turn.   The ritual is low-fuss but indispensible.   You can buy mate gourds and thermoses in any grocery store, and get your thermos filled with hot water at any convenience store or gas station, but you will never see mate served in restaurants or sold in little disposable paper gourds, to go.   it's not that people refuse to drink mate alone - anyone working a solitary shift will have a gourd in hand - but that the concept of being served mate by someone who does not share it with you seems impossible.
Mate aficionados will tell you that mate contains a special compound, mateine, that serves as a tonic and mild stimulant, promoting alertness without making it hard to sleep, reducing fatigue and appetite, helping the digestion and serving as a mild diuretic.  Scientists will tell you that mateine bears a suspicious resemblance to a chemical called caffeine.  Mate aficionados will then grow indignant, explaining that mateine is really a stereoisomer (mirror image) of caffeine, with different effects, which will in turn irritate the scientists, who will snap that caffeine doesn't have a chiral center, so it can't have a distinguishable mirror image, and why don't the mate aficionados just put a sock in it.
Since I am writing this from Argentina, I will just diplomatically state that mate includes a constellation of chemicals, whose presence may affect the way the body absorbs caff... er, mateine, giving it a unique physiological effect.  
The national love affair with mate doesn't just affect lunch.  It has the dire effect of making Argentines less than enthusiastica bout booze.   The wine here is very good (something has to stand up to that steak), but Argentina has no liquor to call its own, relying on whiskies like Old Smuggler and the low-maintenance Don Juan cognac to carry the flag.  

Beer is ubiquitous and comes in a bewildering variety of sizes, although there is a skittishness about the full-on liter.  Things level off at 970 mL.  In my case, it means I end up drinking 1940 mL of beer as a kind of personal protest, and all is well with the world.   To make up for the abundance of sizes, beer comes in only one variety, Quilmes, which inevitably comes served with a tripartite platter of snacks - nuts, salty cylinders, and aged potato chips.    On rare occasions, you may even get a four-leaf platter (olives), this is considered lucky.  
Once you have had your afternoon chopp and its accompanying beer snacks, there is nothing better in the world than switching on the television to watch one of the many cooking shows that seem to be so popular here.   You can take your pick from superhip (filmed at an angle, chef has sleeveless T-shirt) to extremely low-pressure shows for frazzled moms (today's dessert: whipped cream!), but they all pale in the face of the program called "Dulces Tentaciones", starring the Swiss radical nun Sister Bernarda.   This fantasy grandmother shows you how to make tarts, tortes, and other old world desserts, carefully cleaning her work area in between recipes while classical guitar or flute plays in the background.   It is the most relaxing television program ever created, better than any drug, better than any steak.
If you're really  curious about Argentine food, or you are planning a trip here, you might want to take a look at Food And Drink in Argentina.  This guide was originally written for foreign residents in Argentina and contains a lot of useful information; some basic tourist info has  been bolted on to widen its market, but it still looks like a good resource.#travel

 Tutorial: Telegram → Logseq quick notes


                  Tutorial: Telegram → Logseq quick notes
                  

December 30th, 2021
I've long wanted a notes app with an optional chat style interface for append-only notes. The idea is that I'll use the simpler append-only interface while on the go, and then use full-featured interface to review, edit, and organize those notes when I'm back at my computer.

I realized recently that a combination of Telegram + Logseq will do exactly what I want! I jot down notes in a Telegram channel, and when I return to my computer, I find them in a single Logseq note called quick notes. It's a dream. 🥰

I figured this might be useful to others, so I wrote down the steps I took to set this up. To get a sense of what you're getting yourself into, here's a demo of how it will work in the end if you follow the directions:
Heads up, it takes several seconds for the message to show up in (a) your quick notes page Logseq and (b) the quick notes.md file that backs it in Dropbox. Here's a video with a full res version of this demo.
What to expect from this tutorial
Result: When you send a message to a particular Telegram channel, it will append the message to a file in Dropbox and will also show up in iCloud and in your Logseq notes.

Requirements: You will need accounts on Telegram, IFTTT, Dropbox, and iCloud. I also assume that you already have a Logseq graph set up and stored in iCloud.

Step 1: Link Telegram to DropboxCreate a new channel in Telegram. I called my channel quick notes.Note that a channel is not the same as a group!Make sure you say allow forwarding, as this will be a requirement for step 4.Create a new applet in IFTTT, and select Telegram as the Trigger.Now you'll connect your channel to IFTTT. Click connect new channels, which will direct you to a chat with the IFTTT bot in the Telegram app. Click the start button at the bottom of the chat.Follow the steps the IFTTT bot shares with you: (a) add the bot as an admin in your quick notes channel and then (b) forward a message from the quick notes channel to the bot.Go back to the IFTTT trigger screen and select quick notes for the which channel? field.Now you'll create the Then action. Select Dropbox and use the Append to a text file action. Here are the values I put in the fields (below). This will append messages you send to your quick notes channel to a file in your dropbox titled Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt.filename: {{ChannelTitle}}content: - {{PostText}}                      collapsed:: true                    -                                   date:: {{PostedAt}} ET            telegram-link:: {{PostUrl}} Dropbox folder path: telegramSave the applet. (Note that you have to click the "update" button twice... no, I don't know why IFTTT made the UI that way...)
Before we move on, let's test to make sure it's working how you expect. Send yourself a message in the quick notes, and a few seconds later you should see it pop up at the bottom of Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt.

Step 2: Link Dropbox to iCloudChange the extension of the file in Dropbox from .txt to .md. Note that the Then part of the IFTTT applet is agnostic to the extension, so this shouldn't break anything. (That said, I'd test this again to make sure it works as expected.)Create a symlink of quick notes.md into wherever you have store your Logseq graph. Here's the command I used, as an example: ln -s "/Users/devonzuegel/Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.md" "/Users/devonzuegel/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/logseq-db/pages"Search Logseq for your new quick notes page. It should show up just like any other page, and when you edit it, you should see the changes reflected in the file in the Dropbox folder and in your iCloud folder.
Let's test it now! Send a message from Telegram to the quick notes channel. After a few seconds, it should show up in Logseq in the quick notes file!

Step 3: Add support for images
For some reason the Telegram trigger we set up in Step 1 doesn't support images, so we have to set up a second trigger to handle that. This is very similar to Step 1, with a few minor tweaks to handle the specifics of images.Create a new applet in IFTTT, and select Telegram > New photo in your channel as the Trigger.Connect your existing quick notes channel to IFTTT (the which channel? field).Create the Then action. Select Dropbox and use the Append to a text file action. Here are the values I put in the fields (below). This will append photos and their captions you send to your quick notes channel to a file in your dropbox titled Dropbox/telegram/quick notes.txt.filename: {{ChannelTitle}}content: - ![]({{PhotoUrl}}){:width 350}      {{Caption}}                        collapsed:: true                     -                                    date:: {{PostedAt}} ET             telegram-link:: {{PostUrl}}  Dropbox folder path: telegram

Now try sending yourself an image, both with and without the caption!

Step 4: Customization
Here's the icon for my quick notes channel 🙂Time to nest!

One option is you can give your channel a cute icon. Or if you're boring, you can just leave it with the default.

You can also rename the channel if you want, but be careful because this might break the IFTTT connection. If you do so, make sure you also update the filename to match in the IFTTT "Then append to a text file" action.

Caveats to keep in mindEmoji: If you send emoji, they won't show up in the file (e.g. a message like "hello 👋" will show up in the .md file as "hello "). I'm not sure why!Audio messages, quoted messages, & non-image attachments: This setup won't work at all with audio messages, quoted messages, or non-image attachments. I'm working to see if there's a way to support those too, but unfortunately I haven't found a solution yet.Forwarded messages: Forwarded messages are handled in a very buggy way, and I'm not entirely sure why. I don't mind too much because I almost never forward messages to my quick notes, but I did want to call it out because it has unexpected behavior. If you figure out what the issue is, let me know and I'll update this post!Timezone: The date:: will be in whatever timezone you set in your IFTTT settings. It does not have the local time where you sent the message in Telegram. (For me, that's Eastern Time.)
FAQ
Q: Why use Dropbox at all if your Logseq notes are stored in iCloud?Unfortunately, IFTTT doesn't support iCloud as a plugin, but it does support Dropbox. So the next best thing was to sync the documentI also checked Zapier, and it doesn't support iCloud OR Telegram as plugins, so it was a no-go.
Q: What are the limitations of this solution?It doesn't work when the computer where you have the symlink isn't running.Note that this may create merge conflicts. To me this is okay, because I'm treating my quick notes as purely append-only, so merge conflicts can't really happen.
Q: Why is this useful?Here's a thread where I discuss the basic idea:

 OSS lazy-loads governance


                  OSS lazy-loads governance
                  

April 7th, 2019
A special characteristic of open source software (OSS) is that you don't need institutional support to get started. It's interesting to compare this to physical infrastructure, like dams or railroads. Before you can begin those projects, you need upfront capital, permits, rights-of-way, environmental impact reviews, community hearings... and so much more. 

By contrast, all you need in order to begin a digital infrastructure project is an internet connection and some free time. As a result, OSS projects only confront governance challenges once they've become prominent and complex enough to warrant formal solutions.
It is hard to create new physical infrastructure.It is easy to start a new open source project.This low barrier to entry makes software exciting! It's one of my favorite things about this industry. Any developer with a good idea can share it with the world, without asking for permission.
It also means that OSS maintainers are forced to confront questions about governance (e.g. decision-making, funding, and communication) later, often once the project has already become an important dependency to other projects and communities. This has some interesting implications for how projects resolve these challenges.

On one hand, the delayed germination of governance problems makes it harder to find solutions. Here are a few reasons why:The community is larger and more diverse: By the time governance problems rear their head, a wider range of people have a stake in the project. This scale makes it harder to resolve governance challenges, because those involved have competing ideas about what the solutions should be. This increases the likelihood of controversy. Earlier in a project's life, when decisions affect fewer people, the community is nimble and capable of communicating big changes. When important questions are raised later (for example: "Who's in charge?" or "Where does the money come from?"), there are many more actors who want to shape the answers.Users have preset expectations: The increased scope of a project simply makes it harder to change anything at all, regardless of the specific direction of the change. Every project operates by a set of rules, whether or not they are deliberate, and the community that forms around the project will come to depend on that structure. If you create a formal system where there were previously-accidental rules, it changes the way a project functions, upsetting the community's expectations.

It's similar to what happens when you introduce a bug into an API. By the time you find it and want to fix it, users have come to depend on the buggy behavior, and it would disrupt their integration if you were to change it. It can worth that disruption cost (in the case of both governance and API design), but it is a cost, and it makes that change all the more difficult.The maintainer may not be prepared or eager to solve governance problems: Just as many startup founders discover that running a late-stage company requires a very different skillset than finding early product-market fit, the developers who create OSS are often excited about the early technological experimentation but less so about persuading people, facilitating disputes, securing funding, and establishing communication practices. (There are OSS maintainers who do have this desire and skillset, but it's not the default.)
On the other hand, this delay can in some ways make it easier to find solutions to governance problems:The project has room to grow: One advantage of this dynamic is that OSS projects don't have to spend early effort solving problems that fall outside of their core competency before they even know if the project will work. They can "lazy-load" their governance problems until they know it's worth their time to develop solutions.

As an analogy, imagine you're thinking of getting into cycling—you should not spend hours researching the perfect bike or forking over thousands of dollars for the perfect carbon fiber frame. Instead, borrow a friend's bike or rent one for a weekend to go for a spin. After all, you're not even sure if you're ready to commit yet! OSS projects are similar. You don't know how useful it is until people start using it, so you're better off focusing on just getting it to work before spending brain cycles worrying about the governance.Problems are solved from experience rather than hazy predictions: Lazy-loading governance also means that you have a better understanding of what problems you're solving for in the first place. In physical infrastructure, governance is decided before a community fully understands the needs and repercussions of that project, which can result in wasting effort to solve nonexistent or misunderstood problems.

It's like buying furniture before finding an apartment—you're likely to misjudge what you actually need, requiring you to go back to IKEA once you've moved in. The low barrier to entry of software means that an OSS community has a chance to bump into the problem in the real world a few times before they're forced to come up with a solution.
This ability to "lazy-load governance" is an important structural characteristic of OSS. It brings unique challenges, but it's also a great advantage to working with bits rather than atoms. Understanding this dynamic can help communities predict and prepare for some of the challenges they face as they grow.


The urgency of settling questions of governance at different points in a project's life is very different in physical infrastructure compared to OSS.

    	By Razib Khan | 
		December 17, 2009 1:42 pm
Apropos of my skepticism of Census projections of 2050 demographic balances, there’s a new paper out on Argentina which is relevant. Here’s Wikipedia on Argentina’s self-conception:
As with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia and the United States, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. Most Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th and 20th century immigrants from Europe, and 86.4% of Argentina’s population self-identify as European descent. An estimated 8% of the population is mestizo, and a further 4% of Argentines were of Arab or East Asian heritage. In the last national census, based on self-identification, 600,000 Argentines (1.6%) declared to be Amerindians (see Demographics of Argentina for genetic studies on the matter). Following the arrival of the initial Spanish colonists, over 6.2 million Europeans emigrated to Argentina from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries Argentina was second only to the United States in the number of European immigrants received, and at the time, the national population doubled every two decades mostly as a result.
.In contrast to Mexico, which is self-consciously a synthetically a "mestizo" nation which conceives of itself as a cultural and biological synthesis between European and native, I think it is fair to portray Argentineans as a settler society of Europeans in their self-image. As I have said before, this mythos goes a bit too far. The median Argentinean probably has enough indigenous ancestry to qualify as a Native American tribal member in the United States by the rules of blood quantum (on the order of 20-25%). Here’s a multi-dimensional genomic window into this reality, Inferring Continental Ancestry of Argentineans from Autosomal, Y-Chromosomal and Mitochondrial DNA:We investigated the bio-geographic ancestry of Argentineans, and quantified their genetic admixture, analyzing 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA markers (ASDM) from autosomal, Y and mitochondrial chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that European, Native American and African ancestry components were detectable in the contemporary Argentineans, the amounts depending on the genetic system applied, exhibiting large inter-individual heterogeneity. Argentineans carried a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); instead, African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Population substructure in Argentina considering the eight sampled provinces was very small based on autosomal (0.92% of total variation was between provincial groups, p = 0.005) and mtDNA (1.77%, p = 0.005) data (none with NRY data), and all three genetic systems revealed no substructure when clustering the provinces into the three geographic regions to which they belong. The complex genetic ancestry picture detected in Argentineans underscores the need to apply ASDM from all three genetic systems to infer geographic origins and genetic admixture. This applies to all worldwide areas where people with different continental ancestry live geographically close together.
.I’ve outlined a reasonably plausible model for how this situation came out before. Strong male bias in European settlement and immigration. This would naturally result in the persistence of maternal indigenous ancestry, while at the same time contributing to the dominance of European ancestry. Dienekes points out:
European ancestry in mtDNA (44.3%) and Y-chromosome (94.1%) gives an estimate of 69.2%, compared to 78.6% for autosomal markers. Native S. American in mtDNA (53.7%) and Y-chromosome (4.9%) gives an estimate of 29.3%, compared to 17.28% for autosomal markers. Finally, African mtDNA (2%) and Y-chromosomes (0.9%) gives an estimate of 1.45% compared to 4.15% for the autosomal markers.
.If one assumes serial matings between European men and mixed women the uniparental lineages would underestimate the total ancestral contribution of Europeans, as the "mixed" women themselves progressively became more European in ancestry. As for the African lineages, the proportions are small, but one could envisage scenarios whereby slave women have mixed-race children, and for whatever reason their sons marry out and reproduce to a greater extent than their daughters. This would eliminate African mtDNA from the population, but maintain the total ancestral contribution.
Let’s see how the sample above relates to other world populations:

The people of Argentina are mostly European in ancestry, so these results match our expectation. Now let’s visualize it in another way:

The Structure bar plot is small, but you can see the intra-population variance among Argentineans. A substantial proportion of the population of Argentina arrived within the last 100 years. But, a far smaller number of Argentineans have only ancestry from within the last 100 years. In other words, to have exclusively grandparents or great-grandparents who were only immigrants or only the children of immigrants must be relatively rare, looking at the detectable proportion of indigenous ancestry across most of the population. Since Argentina was a mixed-race society before mass immigration, as long as the roots of any given individual goes back to the period before mass immigration than it is likely that they will have some non-European ancestry.
Of course this doesn’t really change anything. I have known of individuals who look European with less than 25% Native American ancestry who identify as Native American. I have known individuals who show their Native American ancestry on hindsight who don’t identify as such. To say that racial identity is a social construction is ludicrous on the boundaries. An blonde Swede would not pass for a Sinhala. But there are plenty of gray lands in between, and the populations of Latin America often inhabit those domains. Someone who in Brazil identifies as white could be identified as African American in the United States. Someone whose forebears were part of the white racial aristocracy of Cuba two generations ago may now self-identify as a Person of Color in the United States (while at the same time being a participant in the racial discrimination which Afro-Cubans still suffer within the greater Cuban community.
The relevance for the United States is clear. I think the Census projections underplay the likely role of admixture in "whitening" the population. Though white-black biracial actors can not plausibly play white characters in American culture, white-Asian actors do. Those of partial Hispanic ancestry have long passed for their career’s sake (and sometimes later come  back out when social norms changed). Therefore, I think America may have a non-Hispanic white majority just a little longer in its own mind than what the genes and projections might tell us….
(the countervailing trend would be the tendency of people will little, or rumored, Native American ancestry to identify as Native American)

September 12th, 2018
In a recent conversation, Sebastián pointed out that there is a dearth of words to talk about cities. I gestured to a building while walking around the Fillmore and said "That's some nice urbanism!", and he grumbled that that's equivalent to pointing to a shop and saying "That's some nice economics!". 

His point was that the word "urbanism" is overloaded, and he's right. We use it to describe everything in the lexical space: concrete physical objects, the built environment as a whole, the politics around the built environment, and the meta category of all of these things, too. There are many elements, characteristics, and behaviors that recur across urban landscapes, but our vocabulary for discussing these patterns is sparse. I have strong imagery in my head but lack the language to express them.

Words are important. It's hard to care about or act upon something without the label to describe it, and the more fitting the label, the more aware of it you'll become. Words give you a handle to hold onto an idea. Terms elevate concepts, both within your own mental hierarchy as well as through enabling you to communicate those concepts.

Some folks are doing a great job defining precise, evocative urbanist vocabulary. Since reading Nathan Lewis' Narrow Streets for People series, I've squealed in delight every time I notice a Narrow Street. (Just ask any of my travel companions if you don’t believe me.) Andrew Price has also offered a lot of useful labels. One of my favorites is Fine- vs Coarse-Grained Urbanism, though it falls into the trap Sebas mentioned, overloading the term "urbanism". (This one isn't such a bad culprit, since the operative words are the adjectives fine- and coarse-grained rather than the noun they're modifying.) I'd like to expand on these, to enrich our language for talking about urbanism.

Characteristics of a good label:Evocative: It should conjure imagery fitting for whatever you're describing Short: The more concise the better!Accessible: it should not require a lot of insider context in order to understand what it meansAvailable: not overloaded with lots of other meanings
Here are the labels I collected so far, ranging in quality and filed under "ekistic lexicon". I'm all ears if any confuse you or you have suggestions/improvements!Names for street types (borrowed from Nathan Lewis' blog)
Grand Boulevards ArterialsNarrow Streets for People 😍Fine- vs Coarse-Grained Urbanism (there's that pesky, overloaded "urbanism" again)Urban Chasm
When a large, long feature severs two areas in a city (usually a wide road or highway, but sometimes an empty greenspace or a block of big, unwelcoming buildings)Example: the El Camino-Caltrain corridor that slices between northeast and southwest Mountain View
Highways and large boulevards often have this effect of creating barriers between neighborhoods "Urban barrier" was also a contender, but I like the imagery of "chasm" better 
Public Forum
A place where people naturally go to see other people and occasionally interact with strangersExample: Plaza Armenia in the Palermo neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina


String of Shops (not as evocative as I'd like)Natural Stage
A place musicians/dancers naturally choose to perform Example: Beneath the bridge across from the Conservatory of Flowers in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park
Uh oh, it looks like your embed code is broken.
Micro Lawns

Built Environment (overly general and sounds pretty stuffy...)Tucked Entrances
Like the little doors in Amsterdam Not the best
Doorstep Living Room (awkward naming...)
Amsterdam is great at this

Street Nook
A cozy, tucked away space where it would be relaxing to read a bookAnother contender: Pocket (but kind of awkward for some reason...)Spanish has a good word for this: "Rincón"Lisbon has a lot of these


Hostile Architecture Towers in a ParkUrban EdenGreenspace (not a great label, because urbanists think of this is a Bad Thing but it sounds nice to newcomers)Streetscape (as compared to Cityscape, which is usually of a skyline)
Side note: something I've noticed is that image search results of a city's name are almost always skylines or aerial shots, rarely anything from a pedestrian's view
Gruen Transfer, when a street or mall is designed in such a way that encourages shoppers to cross-pollinate shops, maximizing unplanned sales.
Wide, intimidating streets and coarse-grained buildings diminish this effect, while narrow, welcoming streets and finer-grained buildings tend to increase it.

Street Canopy
Maybe we can just stick with the simpler label Street Trees


And here are some patterns I've noticed or concepts I've articulated but haven't been able to come up with fitting labels. Request for help on these:Category of categories of concrete things of interest. As in, what is the name of the category that includes Nooks, Towers in a Park, Narrow Streets for People, and so on? A few ideas that I'm not satisfied with:
Feature? Overloaded word Attraction? Implication is that the types of things in the set are flashy when they often may not beElement? Need something less neutral sounding Motif? Implies too much form and not enough function though
Lively zones with lots of pedestrians, shops, and activities. The kinds of places that would be colored orange on a Google Map
Welcoming seating in public places (e.g. benches)Fifth Avenue-esque streets 
Similar tenants as high-end malls, but on a regular street. Usually they've been around for a while, and they have luxurious boutique anchor tenantsImportant that they're easy to cross, for cross-pollination of shoppers to enable a Gruen Transfer
Those long, narrow shopping streets that are fairly generic 
Somewhat like the Fifth Avenue-esque streets mentioned above, but lower-end and more generic
Places that look interesting on maps but are actually terrible in real life (i.e. roundabouts, massive non-Central Park parks, big bridges, etc... why are we drawn to them?)Those places that are quite nice but you never have any reason to walk. Parkways are common places for this to happenA better word for Single Family Home — maybe I'm getting greedy, but SFH is overly technical and not very evocative
And of course there are so many more things I didn't think to list here or didn't notice in the first place (perhaps because there isn't a word for it!). I'll continue to add to this list as folks send in suggestions + as I come up with new labels.

 Inflation propagates unevenly

                  Inflation propagates unevenly
                  

January 2nd, 2022
Inflation hits some parts of the economy harder and faster than others. It's obvious once you say it, and yet the way pundits and academics talk about inflation glosses over this reality. As a result, most people who haven't had direct experience with high inflation have a flawed view of how it affects daily life.

Popular use of the term "inflation" makes it sound like the inflation rate is a single indisputable number that you can plug into a formula to make decisions. A pen pal recently made the following (paraphrased) comment in an email to me:

Inflation isn't actually a problem, since all it's doing is changing the measuring stick. Businesses can just price it into what they charge, workers can just price it into their wage negotiations, and banks can just price it into the interest rates on their loans. Nominal prices go up, but on a relative basis, real prices are essentially the same.
Unfortunately it's not that simple. That model doesn't factor in information asymmetry, time delays, or structural differences between economic actors. It can take years for an inflation shock to propagate through the economy and reach a stable equilibrium, and it only does so after wreaking havoc on people's expectations about money and commerce.
This unevenness creates surprising downstream effects that are difficult to price in. In turn, systemic uncertainty reduces people's willingness to make long-term investments. (For example, high-inflation Argentina has almost no mortgage industry.) This drawback in investment isn't predicted by the model that my friend had in mind, because the model doesn't take into account the uncertainty that inflation causes or its psychological impacts.

So let's go beyond the abstract term "inflation" and look at what it actually means in the real world. Inflation describes the overall effect of many individual people responding to the opportunities and challenges they see day-to-day. It's a very reactive process—prices adjust upwards throughout the economy as a response to the adjustment of other prices around them.

Each of these adjustments happens at a different interval, depending on how quickly the information flows and how much power the person has to react. When a baker notices that flour is more expensive than last month, he'll increase the prices on the menu to cover those costs. When a independent consultant notices that her landlord raised her rent this year, she'll start to charge her clients more to be able to pay her expenses.

As a result, prices adjust at different rates across an economy. Inflation is a much more staggered, uneven process than our models and metrics take into account. For example, cheese in Argentina has gotten much more expensive in the past few years. One Argentine I know said that he can't believe that a kilogram of cheese costs the same as a kilogram of beef, and as a result he and his family have stopped buying cheese to grate on their pasta.

Current prices in the US illustrate the effect as well. The NYT writes that "prices have soared for physical products but have risen only modestly for services. The cost of gasoline is up 58% in the last year, while health insurance prices have fallen almost 4%. Meat prices are up 13%, dairy 1.6%. Boys’ apparel is up 8.4%, while girls’ apparel is down 0.4%."

As a result, the inflation rate each person experiences is very personalized. It's hard to agree on what "the inflation rate" is, because it depends on what you need to buy. If you drive a lot, fuel inflation will impact you more. If you're vegetarian, meat inflation isn't going to hit your pocket book.

Foreign exchange (FX) fluctuations also create weird distortions in the economy. When your currency depreciates, imports suddenly become more expensive, while domestic products aren't affected much at first. There's a whole spectrum between these extremes that is affected in uneven ways. For example, Argentina manufactures some cars locally, but those cars need electronic control units that are not manufactured in Argentina. As a result, when a devaluation occurs, Argentine car prices grow more quickly than the price of beef but not as quickly as pure imports like laptops.

This uneven effect impacts income too, not just consumption. I've heard multiple Americans say that "inflation is good for workers because it erodes debts", but they forget that wages are generally the last thing to adjust. Employers are motivated to change prices more rapidly than wages, and salaries are usually negotiated on a quarterly or yearly basis. This means that households lose purchasing power when inflation occurs. This is especially difficult those who are living paycheck to paycheck. 

Wage adjustments are not just slow but also uneven across the economy. For example:A waiter might do okay when their tips are a percentage of prices, because as long as the restaurant's owner updates prices consistently (which they're very motivated to do), the tip-based wages will adjust accordingly. Their base pay will not adjust so quickly though, because the restaurant owner is unlikely to updated wages as fast as menu prices.A retiree with a pension is in a really tough spot, because pensions are rarely (if ever?) indexed to inflation, so over time their income gets eroded to zero.Architects are in a tough spot too. They usually charge large lump fees, so if they give you a quote at the beginning of the year and then inflation hits, the real value of the quote they gave you went way down by the time you actually pay for their services.As a general rule, inflation disproportionately harms people who can't easily adjust their income upwards. Fixed contracts and fixed incomes are especially vulnerable. Wages also don't automatically adjust—you generally need to advocate for yourself to get a raise—so if you lack negotiating skills in a high-inflation economy, you're at a significant disadvantage.

One concrete example: I know a general contractor who was working on several houses in Argentina in 1989, a year when the peso saw 5,000% inflation. That year, he made the unpleasant discovery that his clients paid late much more often than usual. They always had excuses: "Ah sorry, I forgot to pay before I went on vacation. I'll pay you when I'm back!" When you're seeing 40% inflation per month, delaying payment by a week is effectively a 10% discount. Awfully convenient to be out of town the week you're supposed to pay! Ever since learning this lesson the hard way, the contractor has always denominated his prices in USD.

When you look at abstract models, it's easy to miss the realities on the ground. The theoretical concept that you can "just price in inflation, what's the big deal!" does not hold up to the reality of how inflation actually propagates through the economy. 

The term "inflation" is useful shorthand, but it's important to remember that it's just that: a shorthand.

 Contemplating calendars

                  Contemplating calendars
                  

July 10th, 2019
My friends say that my calendaring practice is atypical (and mock me incessantly for it). They're not wrong, but I'll contend that most people underutilize this ubiquitous tool. A calendar is not just a reminder device for keeping track of external events. Used right, a calendar can be a full-fledged tool for thought. For me, it's a dynamic journal with a wide range of useful, meaningful, and surprising perks.

Here are some of the more idiosyncratic reasons I value my calendar so much:Scaffolding for a memory palace: Calendar events inevitably neglect most relevant details about the past, but nonetheless they can serve as a trigger to place you in your memory palace. They create anchors in your mind that can help you recall other details.Chronometer of the past: It's instrumentally useful when you're trying to figure out the chronology or casualty of some that's happened to you in the past. For example, my boyfriend and I couldn't remember the day we started dating, so we scrolled back in my calendar's history to determine when to celebrate our anniversary.Self reflection: It's a useful tool for honestly reflecting on how you use your time. I've changed some behaviors from looking back on past weeks and seeing that I'm spending more time than I thought on things that I don't actually care about.Planner: Calendars are helpful for visualizing your time, which gives you superpowers over how you spend that time. While this isn't too far off from how people already use calendars, I think it's vastly underrated.Pleasant nostalgia: It's pleasantly nostalgic to look back on the person you used to be. 😊 While doing my taxes recently, I was scrolling through my calendar to remind myself of my various income sources (i.e. for the "Chronometer" reason), and it made the experience of doing my taxes actively pleasant because it was a nice reminder of all of the interesting things I did in 2018. What a good year that was!
Most people I know use calendars solely as a way to coordinate events in the far future and/or with other parties. They generally have the following, fairly limited purposes in mind:To ensure that they have the same information as the other participant(s),To have a reminder of blocked off time so they don't accidentally double-book, andTo store information about the location and timing that they only care about as the event approaches.
There are a few additional steps I take that extend my calendar's usefulness into other contexts, too:I often add events retroactively, i.e. events that have already occurred (which is useless to a calendar user who only uses it to prepare for future events).I add events for personal "events" as well as external ones. For example, I have events for chores, work tasks, sleep, showers, and  weekend projects.For personal events, I include a lot of detail in the event title (and sometimes extend into the notes) and don't worry much about editing it to be optimally readable. The purpose is to jog my memory with as much interesting mental state and intention from that moment I created the event as possible, not to communicate as effectively as possible with the outside world. I do try to clean up the phrasing for external events (where there's 1+ invitee) more, since they don't want to deal with my messy brain.I color code my calendars into rough categories. Not sure how useful it is but it certainly makes my calendar prettier to look at. 🤓

One question I always get is "how do you have the discipline to enter everything, especially retroactively?!". One answer is that I don't. I often forget! And that's fine.* The purpose of my calendar diary is not to be a perfect record of how I spend my time. It's a map of the territory, and the purpose is to trigger useful and interesting memories, reminders, and ambitions that don't fit as well in other mediums (including my own mind). 

A more useful answer: I think of this input step in terms of triggers—i.e. what moments call for me to add something to my calendar, and what's the reminder? A few examples:When someone invites me to an event, I add the event + location + notes to my calendar. (This one is pretty typical I think.)When I'm planning my tasks for the day, I block off the rough amounts of time I expect various goals to take. This is useful for prioritizing time visually. It's easier to reason about an abstract thing (whether it's a calendar or an essay or a math problem) once you've written it down. These time blocks almost always change through the day as different things come up, or when tasks take longer/shorter than expected; the important thing isn't that they're correct when you first "draft" the events, just that it gives you something to work off of.I have repeating events for things like my daily workout. I often move around the exact timing on a per-day basis, but just having it blocked off as some time in my calendar is helpful so that I remember to make time for it. Below, you can see how I have the recurring "25-minute workout" scheduled every single day in the future for 8:30pm. I don't actually do the exercises at that exact time usually, but it helps me remember that I've budgeted 25 minutes of my day to doing that. I do intermittent fasting on most days, and I mark that eating window on my calendar.
These triggers are somewhat personal, so I wouldn't recommend any specific one to others. These can just be used as inspiration.

The habit has evolved organically over many years, so I don't have a grand strategy that's easy to articulate. This is a brain dump and not at all comprehensive, just the first things that popped to mind. I just hope this sparked some ideas in your head for creative uses of calendars. I'd love to hear about other unconventional ways you use calendars, too!

Footnotes
* I will sheepishly note that at one point I did aim to track everything precisely in my calendar, and whenever I'd accidentally forget something I'd fret that I was "polluting the data". I even went so far as to impose standard titles across like events. For instance, I would slap myself if I wrote one event as "Shower" and another as "Shower time"—how was I supposed to reconcile all this messiness?! I imagined that at some point I'd programmatically analyze the calendar data and get useful RescueTime like insights out of it. I now realize that's a fool's errand, and that a calendar is at best a useful map of my time. I shouldn't even try to mold it into the territory itself, because it's impossible to transfer the depth of richness that is how a human spends their time into a grid, no matter how many different color-coded categories you have.Thanks to Laura Deming whose email query prompted this writeup!

                  We Should Be Building Cities for People, Not Cars
                  

August 19th, 2016
The way we live is shaped by our infrastructure—the public spaces, building codes, and utilities that serve a city or region. It can act as the foundation for thriving communities, but it can also establish unhealthy patterns when designed poorly.For decades, San Francisco’s waterfront was dominated by the massive Embarcadero Freeway. The Ferry Building was hidden in the shadow of a grungy overpass, and the double decker highway blocked residents’ access to the bay all along the eastern edge of the peninsula. One local writer said the freeway "shunted pedestrians through a dark, sooty gauntlet between downtown and the San Francisco Bay".Then, in 2002, the freeway was replaced with a palm-lined boulevard and a streetcar line down the middle. The Embarcadero was transformed from a fading industrial zone into a center of tourism and leisure. San Francisco’s stunning waterfront became a destination rather than just a place to pass through.The turning point for the Embarcadero was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that destroyed the freeway. Demolition proposals had always been shot down due to fears that it would create unbearable traffic. The quake forced San Franciscans to live without the freeway, and they quickly discovered that the feared congestion never happened. Instead, the neighborhood saw a massive economic boost, and the new boulevard is one of the best parts of the city. By damaging the highway beyond repair, the quake was able to do what political pressure couldn’t.

San Francisco’s Ferry Building, before and after the Embarcadero Freeway was torn down

Unfortunately, America’s inherited infrastructure is more like the old Embarcadero Highway than the boulevard that replaced it. Urban planners spent the 20th century building cities for cars, not people, and alternatives to driving have been systemically undervalued. This legacy has resulted in substandard health outcomes, missed economic opportunities, and a shortage of affordable housing.
We can’t wait around for another earthquake to reverse generations of bad policy. Luckily, it doesn’t require a natural disaster to begin reshaping our infrastructure. Small changes can have an outsized impact in expanding alternatives for how people move around. Rebuilding our infrastructure to enable walking, cycling, and mass transit would bring health and economic benefits that far outweigh its price tag.

Our infrastructure is making us sick
The American health care crisis is at its heart an urban design crisis. To get a sense for the toll our car-centric infrastructure has taken on our physical and mental well-being:Car fatalities have killed far more Americans than all of our wars combined.Commuting by car ranks as people’s least favorite regular activity.A 23 minute driving commute has the same effect on happiness as a 19% reduction in income.For every extra 5 minutes Atlanta residents drive each day, they are 3% more likely to be obese."Doctors focus on remote disease risks, but what really kills us is our built environment," explained Dr. Richard Jackson, a physician who served for 9 years as the CDC’s Director for Environmental Health. People who walk, bike, or take some form of mass transit to work weigh less, live longer, and have lower divorce rates than commuters who drive. They also have lower rates of depression, more free time, and a more robust social life.
Despite its costs, driving remains the most common mode of travel in the US, at around 85 percent of commuting trips. One out of six workers commutes more than 45 minutes each way, and private vehicles account for 60% of trips a mile or shorter. But it’s not drivers’ fault; rather, our infrastructure encourages — and in many cases forces — us to depend on cars. Our communities are built at the scale of highways rather than humans. Expressways slice through neighborhoods, and widened streets prioritize the flow of cars over making it worth traveling to their destinations. In the 1950s and 60s, large scale demolitions were commonplace in order to make way for fast moving motorized traffic, and communities from New York to Los Angeles have never fully recovered.
People choose to drive despite its costs because they lack reasonable alternatives. Unfortunately, this isn’t an accident of history. Our transportation system has been overly focused on automobile traffic flow as its metric of success. This single-minded focus has come at the cost of infrastructure that supports alternative ways to travel. Traffic flow should instead be one goal out of many. Communities would be far healthier if our infrastructure actively encouraged walking, cycling, and other forms of transportation rather than subsidizing driving and ignoring alternatives.


Walkability has major economic benefits
It makes financial sense for cities to invest in walkability. There is a scarcity of walkable neighborhoods in the US housing market, and this unmet demand is reflected in the prices people are willing to pay for housing in those cities that embrace a pedestrian-friendly model. Cities that remove barriers to pedestrian-centric development have an economic edge on those that do not.
Having a critical mass of pedestrians signals that a neighborhood is safe and interesting, which in turn draws more people into that area. This creates a positive feedback loop — with people and opportunities nearby, it becomes increasingly attractive for businesses and residents to move in. Walkability correlates with property values so closely that it has become standard practice in real estate to advertise a home’s "walk score", because a high grade earns a premium. Websites like Zillow and Apartments.comoffer calculations for commute length and walkability to everyday destinations like grocery stores, and it is common for real estate agents to advertise the walk score as a major selling point.
The Embarcadero in San Francisco is a perfect illustration of how transitioning away from car-centric infrastructure can revitalize a neighborhood. When the highway was removed in 2002, the area experienced a massive economic boost. Within four years, housing in the area increased by 51% and jobs increased by 23%, and by freeing up land for development, the highway removal has also increased the city’s tax base.
Portland offers another helpful model. In contrast to most American cities, Portland has invested in multiple modes of transportation for decades. As a result, its residents drive 20% less than other major metropolitan areas, and the city has experienced economic benefits beyond just a rise in property values. "Portlanders save a bundle on cars and gas, [so] residents have more money to spend on other things they value, which in turn stimulates the local economy," said economist Joe Cortright in Portland’s Green Dividend. Less driving leads to greater savings, and those savings flow to the local economy rather than distant oil producers.

Walkability makes communities more affordable
Walkable, transit-friendly cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco are infamous for their high housing prices. However, when housing and transportation costs are considered together, these places are far more affordable than sprawling cities. It is true that rents and property values decrease as you move farther from the city center, but the added costs of owning and operating a car quickly burns through whatever savings came from moving away.
This calculation is even more clear when you also consider the opportunity cost of driving. Time spent in traffic means you have less time to do other things that you care about. "There’s a simple rule of thumb: Every 10 minutes of commuting results in 10% fewer social connections," said Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam. "Commuting is connected to social isolation, which causes unhappiness." Workers with long commutes are also less productive. Employee absenteeism would be about 15–20% less if all workers had a negligible commute, and workers with a long commute are more likely to leave early or arrive late.

Affordable housing would be far more attainable if our infrastructure encouraged walking and alternative forms of transportation. Parking minimums are one example of how car-centric infrastructure works against this goal. A standard parking spot occupies as much square footage as a small studio apartment, and that’s without factoring in the driveway space required for maneuvering into the spot. All in all, shops in California are required to provide 288 square feet of parking space for every 250 square feet of retail space — 115% more space is required to accommodate the parking for any new retail development. In Los Angeles, 3.3 spaces exist for every car in the city. Other states have similar or worse requirements. As a result, acreage devoted to parking hovers around 30% of the ground area in the core of the average sun belt city. This is area that could otherwise be used for some other productive use. If we could make even a tiny dent in the amount of space consumed by parking, we could greatly improve the affordability of cities.
These parking minimums not only consume valuable space — they also induce more driving. With so much area devoted to parking, the distance between destinations increases, which in turn increases the necessity of driving. With more drivers doing more traveling, more parking spots are needed to accommodate their cars, continuing this vicious cycle. On the bright side, this also means that the benefits of changing these requirements are compounding. If we loosen requirements, we would also see a reduction in demand for parking spots, because the demand for driving itself would decrease as destinations cluster closer together.
Fun fact: SimCity was forced to pretend that all parking lots were underground, because the game would be "really boring if it was proportional in terms of parking lots". SimCity’s lead designer explained, "I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store. That was kind of a problem, because we were originally just going to model real cities … We had to do the best we could do and still make the game look attractive."Tactical, concentrated improvements have an outsized impact
It is feasible — both financially and politically — to make cities more walkable. Simple, low-cost improvements to features like painted bike lanes, wayfinding signs, curb cuts, and tree coverage have an disproportionate impact in transforming a car-dependent metropolis into human-scale, walkable neighborhoods. It is rare that cities find a goal that is both worthwhile and attainable, so urban planners should jump on this opportunity.
Concentrated efforts to revitalize a small area can have a massive impact on an entire city. Mountain View, where I grew up, is a great example of this. When I was a kid, the town’s suburban sprawl required a car ride to get anywhere. However, in the past few years, resources have been directed towards making specific areas in and around downtown more walkable, and residents all over town have seen the benefits. In the summer, the main street is closed for weekly street festivals. Downtown parking spots have been replaced with cafe seating, separated from the road by planter beds. The Stevens Creek Trail connects otherwise isolated neighborhoods to these walkable zones, providing a corridor extending from the marshlands at the edge of the city into the heart of Mountain View and through three other neighboring cities. This corridor lets residents all over town benefit from efforts concentrated in a few small areas of the city. Most streets are still oriented towards cars, but few neighborhoods are more than a short stroll away from a connection to pedestrian-friendly zone. When used strategically, limited resources can revitalize the walkability of an entire community.
Every Sunday, Mountain View’s parking lot at the Caltrain station transforms into a farmers market
Brightly painted bike lanes on Market St have made San Francisco far more bike-friendlyCommunities all around the country have begun to to experiment with retrofitting their built environments in other small ways. The changes don’t have to be radical — they can be as small as repainting crosswalks or planting more trees to provide shade from the sun. California requires employers who provide parking for employees to offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space. It has become common for downtowns to close Main Street for farmers markets and street fairs, and food trucks are a popular way to attract people to public spaces without the risk and hassle of setting up permanent shops. Improvements can range from grassroots efforts to add seating in public parks to city projects to reshape road networks and everything in between. Each community is different in its needs, resources, and existing infrastructure, so I find it particularly exciting to see how different towns come up with creative solutions that fit their particular situations.
Walkability leads to better health outcomes, more affordable housing, and greater economic vitality. The best part is that easy, low-cost changes can go a long way in improving the options for how people move around their communities. Cities all around the country have begun to appreciate and capitalize on alternative modes of transportation, especially walking. We still have decades of auto-dependent land use trends to offset, but small shifts in the way our received infrastructure is designed can go a long way to making our neighborhoods more walkable — and in turn healthier, more affordable, and more vibrant.

                  Advice on writing
                  

August 5th, 2018
Sergey Zavadski emailed me today asking for advice on how to start writing, and I figured I'd share my response here and open an invitation for suggestions from others!

The biggest advice I'll give is to find ways to hold back from self-censoring. There are three key tools I use to do this myself, though there are probably other clever ways I haven't considered.

One is called The Most Dangerous Writing App, which deletes your writing if you stop for more than a few seconds. It's an incredible way to pull the ideas out of your head. I'm continually surprised by how much my thoughts are already structured when I thought I didn't have a grasp at all on the question at hand. It was just in a way that was invisible to me, and this exercise forces me to extract it.

The second is I often walk around the city recording my voice on my phone. To an onlooker this looks like I'm on a call, but actually I'm just talking to myself! I then use GoTranscript or a voice-to-text tool to transcribe the audio. Both this and the first strategy share the property of forcing you to "move forward" with rather than constantly revising what you've already written. Different people are blocked on different things of course, but I find a common pattern is paralyzing oneself with self-editing. The first draft is the hardest part, so you shouldn't make it harder than it already is. I find anything that turns the first draft into an append-only exercise to be really useful. You can always go back and clean it up later.

The third is actually emails just like this! (This is what I originally sent to Sergey.) I find the act of composing emails to be much easier than writing from scratch something I intend to be a blog post. My guess as to why is that the correspondent gives me a fairly concrete prompt, a conversational style/tone to build off of, and an audience to keep in mind, which narrows down the scope of what I'm writing. It also helps that I feel like it is a "safe space"; if I already have an email thread with someone there's a benefit of the doubt established that you can't always assume when publishing straight to the internet. This reduces a lot of ambient discomfort and urge to self-censor. But then once it's written it's usually something I'm actually happy to publish, and anything that doesn't come across quite right I can just clean up. There have been several cases where I've written up a long private email and then asked the person if I could publish it. (This post is now one of them!) This has been a surprisingly great source of writing material for me.

In the spirit of this third tactic, I asked Sergey if he didn't mind I publish a version of this and mention him, and now here we are. :)

The art of writing is mostly about unblocking yourself. I find I don't really have a lack of ideas, more that I hold myself back from letting them flow out of me and onto the page.#tools-for-thought

Elm / NoRedInkWelcome, everybody.  Thanks for coming to this session.So I am Evan Czaplicki.  I am the designer of the Elm programming
language.[Time 0:00:17]
slide title:

[image of first page of the paper "Elm: Concurrent FRP for Functional
GUIs", Evan Czaplicki, 30 March 2012]And I got started on it about seven years ago with a paper called
"Elm: Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs".  And I was like, "I really
think I can make this functional programming stuff easier".  And I did
not nail it immediately with that title, but I had this idea of this
experience with typed functional programming that was really joyful.[Time 0:00:40]
slide title: 
[new text added to previous slide:]

Getting set up is easy

Writing programs is fun

Community is friendlyAnd what I wanted to get out with Elm was like I wanted to take that
part that I felt was so fun and make it accessible to other people,
and share that joy that I had felt.And so part of that is technical.  You know, you have to write a
compiler and all of this kind of stuff.  But another part is practical
stuff, like getting set up should be easy.  And that was part of what
was important to me, having spent a whole day just trying to learn
something.  Trying to see if something was interesting, and being
really frustrated.Another piece of that was: if programming was going to be fun, I
wanted the community to be friendly.  I did not want it to be cool
club for the cool kids.  Oh, we are functional programmers and you are
not, because you are dumb.  I did not relate to that.  I just had a
nice time programming, and I wanted to share that nice time, in the
same way that I like sushi, and I might say, "Hey, you should try it
out.  It is pretty nice."  And someone might say, "No thanks".  Oh,
OK.  You know?  That is the kind of interactions I wanted to have,
because it was just about having this experience.[Time 0:01:45]So as I have talked to more open source developers, people who design
languages, people who work on databases, people who work on machine
learning or discussion platforms or environmental sensors, however
much we disagree on design or what our goals are, we all have stories
in common about having a friendly community is really, really
difficult.And that is one of the places in open source where, as good as you can
be at the technical stuff, ultimately you cannot control what is going
to happen.  And if someone is going to yell, it is like "ooohhhh, I
wish that did not happen."So I have been doing this for about seven years now, and I have
started to notice some patterns of behavior that I think probably a
lot of people who have worked in open source with larger projects
[tbd?] will relate to.[Time 0:02:35]
slide title: Pattern

"Why don't you just ..."

copy the JS API directly?

release 0.18.1 now instead?

derive JSON decoders?

It is more complex than it sounds.So one is this, "Why don't you just ..."And in Elm it is like, "Why don't you just get the JS API directly?"
Or release an incremental version, instead of a bigger release?  Or,
hey, can we derive JSON decoders?And the short answer in all of these cases is that it is more complex
than it sounds.  Like if there is something that you can think of in
five minutes, or an hour, or a day, probably someone has thought about
that and considered it.  And there might be implications that you do
not see from your perspective, but someone else in the community might
have a problem with that, that is not obvious to you.So when you are doing design, "Why don't you just ..."  It is like
there are all these different parties that we have to make things work
for.  And I can do my best on my intuition, but ultimately even after
I spend like a week trying to design something that way, I need to go
out and show it to people, and see what objections they bring.  And
then maybe do it with another design.[Time 0:03:32]So this "Why don't you just ..." is quite frustrating.  And one thing
that happens is there are a lot of people who are new to the project.
So maybe there are ten thousand people who might be curious.  Oh, why
don't you just try out this kind of thing?  And the number of people
who know the full context is pretty small.  So maybe there are like
ten, twenty people.So if it takes five minutes to say "Why don't you just blah blah
blah?", and it takes two pages of writing, and you have to write it
very carefully because if you are an influential community member,
people will refer back to what you said four or five years ago, and
say like, "Man, they are such a jerk.  Here is the evidence.  They
said this in 2013."  And it is like, "Aaahhhh, yeah, I said that in
2013.  Yeah."So one thing that is common is like, well if it is so much work, why
don't you just delegate the work?  Right?  So this is a comment I got
in real life, and the italics are from the person talking to me.[Time 0:04:31]
slide title: Pattern
[new text added to previous slide:]

There's another way to deal with this that can improve the current
situation and keep everyone (most of the people?) happy: _delegation_.They said, "There is another way to deal with this.  Delegation."  And
then they go on to describe how delegation works, and what benefits it
might have.  And I was like, "Oh, very interesting.  Yes.  I had not
thought about that."[Time 0:04:44]
slide title: Pattern
[new text added to previous slide:]

"This _somebody_ can also be a "reverse proxy" who's gathering
feedback."And they describe a person who can do all of this work, and they say
this somebody -- again, that is their italics -- can also be a proxy
who is gathering feedback, so you do not have to be in these
discussions.So I was initially very upset about this.  So the unfiltered, in my
own mind, version, was like [gestures as if holding a telephone up to
his ear and mouth]: "Oh, hello, is this the somebody store?  Yes, we
would like someone to take unsolicited advice on the Internet.  Oh,
yeah, it is really mean.  Yeah, it is going to be rough.  Yeah, no one
is going to say thank you.  No.  Yeah, it is unpaid.  It is unpaid.
You don't have anybody?  I was told there would be somebody who
would do this."So this was me in my own life, walking around my room, just like
[gesturing with hands in very frustrated upset manner].  And that is
not a healthy place to be.  That is not how I want to look to a
community.  That is not what I want the community I am a part of to
be, either.And when I took some time and thought about it more, I realized there
is actually a pretty reasonable assumption going on here, which is:
"Free rice means you can take as much as you want."  The rice is free.
I will take a lot of rice.[Time 0:06:02]And so does that imply that free labor means you can use as much as
you want?  Well the labor is free.  But in fact, this is not how labor
works.  If you do not pay for labor, you get less.  And so I think
that is sort of the root thing.  It is like: oh, well it should be
unlimited.  Anyone can help.Now let us assume it is unlimited.  That everybody in the world
actually can help.  In practice, you actually have to work together.
These are highly technical projects.  Are you able to work well
together?  Are your goals with the project aligned?  How much time
does it take to coordinate with that person to get stuff done?  So
even if you can work with anybody you want, there are still these
limitations on who is going to be really effective in doing the right
stuff.[Time 0:06:47]
https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/building-trust-what-has-worked/975So I wrote about that a little bit in this post.  Or no, sorry,
Richard wrote about that in this post here, of what actually does it
take to get involved.  And it is not just the somebody store.[Time 0:07:05]
slide title: Pattern

"On whose authority?"So some people may be thinking: Evan, you are doing a lot of telling
us what is the situation.  But who are you to say that?  And so this
is another pattern that I see a lot: On whose authority?And this is actually the title of a post that was sent to the Clojure
community.  And the post started out "F*** Clojure""There I've said it and God it feels good.""I say it with much admiration and respect to all the community
members."And then they go on to say some criticisms, and talk about their
relationship with women.  And it is quite a roller coaster of a post.But what is interesting besides sort of like it as a journal entry is
that it gets a lot of engagement, right?  So 320 comments on the
Reddit thread.  I am sure people talked about it in other contexts as
well, where there would have been more comments.[Time 0:08:08]And as someone who has been working on an open source project for a
bunch of years now, enough people have told me that Elm is going to
die next month that I am like, "I don't think they are right this
time."  You know, like that fear does not speak to me any more,
because I have the experience.But there are other people in the community who do not have that same
experience, and this can be like a scary thing.  "Man, people are not
liking this thing.  Are we doing something wrong?"  They feel like
maybe it could be better.  They might get defensive.So in one of these 320 comments the creator of Clojure says:
"I found out about this while sitting down to spend my weekend
contributing to the Clojure ecosystem.  Time spent in lieu of
spending time with my wife, having already spent my work week on
other Clojure related stuff."And I relate to this a lot.  I have definitely written like, "Hey, I
get that there are different viewpoints, but we can't yell our
viewpoints at each other."  And that was my Saturday.  And as you work
over the course of the years, there can only be so many Saturdays that
are like that before it starts to hurt you in larger ways.[Time 0:09:25]
So Rich Hickey goes on to say:
"Every time I have to process a diatribe like this, and its
aftermath, the effects on myself, my family, and my coworkers, I
have to struggle back from "Why should I bother?", and every time
it gets harder to justify to myself and my family that it's worth
the time, energy, and emotional burden."Now I have talked to some people about this post, and they thought
different things stood out.  To me, this last part is what stands out,
because I think a lot of people in open source feel this way, and
would never say it out loud.  I was really surprised to see it that
way, and it kind of gave me some confidence to talk about that kind of
stuff as well.So we have our posts like this in the Elm community, with a bunch of
comments as well:"Elm is Wrong" 346 comments

"When will Elm grow up?" 46 comments

"Is Evan Killing Elm's momentum?" 94 commentsAnd I see it not just as like: Oh, man, this is hard for me to
process.  But the people I work with have a hard time processing it.
And then if you just add up all of the time.  Let us say maybe ten
minutes is spent on each of these comments -- which I think is low,
like a conservative estimate -- we are talking about like fifty hours
for this one that is just like dealing with someone's anger.  And
could that have been helping someone new, or spending time with some
family members, or learning some hobby that could get you out of work
and get you a more healthy attitude?So one thing I hear a lot when I talk about this stuff is: If it makes
you so mad, why don't you just not read it?  Why don't you just
... not read it?[Time 0:11:04]
slide title: Pattern

"All discussion is constructive"So another pattern that is really common is that all discussion is
constructive.  You know, "I am just saying how I feel."  I feel like
f*** you, and I respect you a lot.  And I think you are an idiot, but
I really learned a lot from you.  And that is a difficult personal
relationship to have.  I do not know if people have people like that
in their life, but that is a difficult thing to deal with a lot.So one discussion that was along these lines was "Should Elm have
user-definable infix operators?"  This came up recently with our
recent release.  And if we just focus on this question textually,
someone might say, "Yeah, there are cases where it makes code shorter
and more convenient."  And someone else might say, "No, because it can
make code harder to read, especially in a large team."And textually, this is an interesting argument.  Yeah, it can make
code shorter.  That is a good point.  And, eh, it might hurt people in
a large team.  And then onlookers will sort of say, oh, which one
seems to make more sense to me?[Time 0:12:08]But when you take a step back, and stop thinking of it as just a
textual argument about who is right, and who is wrong, and say, "All
of these people have different priorities."  Some of them may value
flexibility a lot.  And some people might value simplicity a lot.  And
all of these people exist with different priorities.  So this person
is like, "Yeah, we should have this", really might value flexibility.
And the person who says no, is saying, "Well, all of these benefits
you are telling me about flexibility, or how code can be shorter and
more convenient, that is not persuasive to me.  That is not a 'good
rational argument', because it is not important."And likewise, "How does it work on a large team?"  Well this does not
matter.  It is not about that.  And all of the people exist on this
spectrum with different priorities as well.  They are evaluating it
not as "Which is the true objective argument?" but "Given my
priorities, which is the one that makes the most sense to me?"[Time 0:13:11]So I have come to see constructive discussion is about mutual
understanding, rather than mutual agreement.  And a lot of discussions
on line are like: We are going to get to a point where you agree with
me.  Rather than saying, "Huh, this person is seeing it different.
Why is that?  Maybe they are seeing something I don't."So when I take a step back and think about these different patterns, I
just think like, "Why?"  Why is this happening?  I don't have problems
like this in normal life.  If I am at an Elm conference, or a meetup,
nothing ever is so emotionally difficult as these interactions.So I found this documentary called "All Watched Over By Machines of
Loving Grace" by Adam Curtis.  It is excellent, as is all of his work.
And I found through that a book called "From Counterculture to
Cyberculture".  So this revealed to me an intellectual history going
back to the 1950s that really helps explain what is going on in open
source right now.[Time 0:14:18]So it traces things from a book called "The Human Use of Human
Beings".  So this came out of MIT in 1952, by a person who had created
artillery that could automatically track planes and shoot them down.And then the "Whole Earth Catalog", which was popular in the back to
the land movement.  So a lot of people in communes might have bought
this, but it was a much larger thing than that.  And then finally the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.  And it sort of ties these together in
a very interesting way.So we will look at some of the things going on here.  In The Human Use
of Human Beings, Norbert Wiener introduces the idea of cybernetics.
He defines it as "the study of messages as a means of controlling
machinery and society".  So it is a little weird.  OK, fine.  As you
start to read it, it is like this way of, "let us not look at the
person, but let us look at the messages going around".  And that is
how we will think about how the world works.[Time 0:15:27]And so you see things like: words such as life, purpose, and soul are
grossly inadequate to precise scientific thinking.  Which is like
"fair enough", but also, those things like life and purpose are pretty
important to people as well, to consider.But a person is just a special sort of machine.  We can consider it as
a thing that takes inputs and does stuff.  Emotions are just a useless
epiphenomenon.  That is real.  He said that.Another thing is: we have modified our environment so radically, that
we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in this new
environment.  So it is sort of: how can we take a person and simplify
it down to a machine, or a system that we can understand well?  And
then once we are starting to think of people that way, well we can
improve machines.  We can add things to them and the machines get more
capabilities.  Maybe that is how we move forward as people.And life and purpose is like, we cannot go back to that.  It is too
different now.[Time 0:16:36]So the connecting thread in "Whole Earth Catalog", besides Stewart
Brand, the author of this, knowing a bunch of the people in the
cybernetics group, is this idea of access to tools.  So our
relationship with our tools is going to be how we move forward.  So
this catalog starts with "We are as gods and we might as well get good
at it.  So far, remotely done power and glory -- as government, big
business, formal education, church -- has succeeded to the point where
the gross defects obscure actual gains.  In response, personal power
is developing."So he is focused on a bunch of different topics.  And so education,
finding inspiration, shaping his environment, sharing the adventure.
Now keep in mind, this is written in 1969.  So this is before the
Internet.  And if you read these points as what an ideal view of the
Internet should be, it works really well.  Like you can find out all
sorts of interesting stuff.  You can be inspired by what is going on
out there.  You can find a place where you really fit in, even if you
don't fit in in your local community that has different values than
you.  And you can share that with whoever you want to.  Like there is
this place for self expression.[Time 0:17:58]And so he says, "tools that aid this process are sought and promoted
by the Whole Earth Catalog".  So some people have argued that this is
sort of like what preceded the Internet.  It sort of foresaw what was
going to happen there.  And this publication and the creator, Stewart
Brand, have been really influential.So one of the positive quotes is "When I was young, there was an
amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of
the bibles of my generation."  So that was Steve Jobs.There was a project that Stewart Brand created called The Ten Thousand
Year Clock, which Jeff Bezos helped fund with 42 million dollars.  So
what is this book that was popular on back to the land communes,
became very influential because of this how tools, and a rejection of
hierarchy, we are somehow in this new place where we are going to
choose our own future through our connection with tools.And finally, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Interestingly, the
founders of this met on the Whole Earth Lectronic Link, one of the
earliest message boards.  And so one of the founders wrote "The
Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace"."Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and
steel.  You have no sovereignty where we gather.""I declare the social space we are building to be naturally
independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us."So again you see this distrust of hierarchy.  Big business has failed.
The government has failed.  We are going to find a new way through
this thing.  So one of the early cases that the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, that inspired the creation of this foundation, was there
was a programmer called Lloyd Blankenship.  And Bell South found that
some of their 911 alert system documentation had been posted on a
bulletin board.  And so they got the Secret Service involved and took
some computers that might have sensitive information.[Time 0:19:58]So Lloyd was arrested, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation was
created around that time to help protect people in this situation.  So
after Lloyd was arrested, he wrote something called "The Hacker's
Manifesto", which I think gives a rawer version of what is going on in
this world.So he says: "I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they
teach us bores me.""I've listened to my teacher explain for the fifteenth time how to
reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my
work.  I did it in my head...""And he says: "I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  It does
what I want it to do.  If I make a mistake, it's because I screwed up.
Not because it doesn't like me, or it feels threatened by me, or it
thinks I'm a smartass, or it doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be
here."[Time 0:20:53]So this guy is 21 when he is writing this.  He is someone who is very
disillusioned, not just with government, or big business, but just his
classroom, the social environment he is living in.And he goes on to say, "This is our world now.  We explore, but you
call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, wage wars.  He is trying
to make us believe it is for our own good, yet we are the criminals."So again you see that explicit distrust of hierarchy.  And then,
finally, "My crime is that of outsmarting you.  Something you will
never forgive me for."So I do not know how many people who work on open source will
recognize aspects of this attitude in interactions they have, but
there is sort of such a strong rejection of the social things going
on.  It is like, the teacher who is not teaching you well has a bunch
of other students, and it is difficult to balance all of their needs.
Maybe it is malicious, but maybe there is another reason.  But this
world view is kind of like: I outsmarted you.  You don't see it how I
see it.[Time 0:21:58]So when I take a step back on this intellectual pathway, the things I
sort of draw out from reading these books and things is, one: we are
gods.  Two: hierarchy has failed us.  There is sort of a deep distrust
of hierarchical structures.  I think rightly: there are a lot of bad
things that come out of hierarchy.  And finally: order will emerge
from the new technology.So when we reconsider the patterns we see in open source, this stuff
makes a lot of sense.So it is like, "Why don't you just ...?"  It is like we can just
through reason and rationality, figure out the answer.  Why don't you
just do the obvious thing?Hierarchy has failed us.  So again, "On Whose Authority?" is coming
out of this tradition of "hierarchical structures have not served us
well".  We need to find a way that is not structured in that way.
Like your authority, as the author, is not legitimate on those
grounds.And "All discussion is constructive".  It is like, "well, this is the
new technology.  This is what the new technology is producing, so this
must be the way forward to this place that we want to go."[Time 0:23:10]So I found this pathway really interesting, and it helped me
understand a lot what was going on.  But it is just one of a couple of
different ways of looking at how we got to this level of conflict in
open source.  So I am calling this sort of the intellectual history of
people who are primarily prioritizing freedom.But there are other ones, such as people who are primarily
prioritizing engagement.So I want to start with a quote:
"The enormous expansion of communications ... has entirely
transformed the conditions of trade and commerce.  Everything is
done in haste, at fever pitch.  The night is used for travel, the
day for business; even 'holiday trips' put strain on the nervous
system."Do people relate to that?  Holiday trips being stressful?  I feel
that.  Or I struggle with that, at least.  I try to take a break, or
whatever.[Time 0:24:07]
"Great political, industrial, and financial crises carry this
excitement into far wider areas of the population than ever
before.  Interest in political life has become universal: tempers
are inflamed by political, religious and social struggles, party
politics, electioneering."Does this sound familiar to anybody?  Finally:
"People are forced to engage in constant mental activity and
robbed of the time they need for relaxation, sleep and rest."So if you had to guess when this was written, it is reasonable: it
could be this year.  It could be 2017.  Or maybe someone was really
prophetic and they wrote it in like 1980.  It is like: I see where
this is all going.So this is actually from something Freud wrote in 1902.  The part I
left out is "due to the world-wide telegraph and telephone networks"
and "the immense growth of trade-unionism".  So I think it makes sense
that he would have seen these kinds of things.  He seems like a smart
dude, or at least someone who is very sensitive to human behavior.[Time 0:25:09]And so this is where this intellectual history starts.  So we have
Freud, but we are going to look at two other books.  One is called
Propaganda, from 1928, and one is called Nudge, much more recent, from
2008.So Propaganda.  This is written by Edward Bernays.  This is actually
Freud's nephew.  The connections between all of these works are crazy,
and as you look into any parts of these, like everybody met.
Everybody worked with someone's nephew, or cousin, or Mom.  It is very
strange.So this book is essentially a bunch of stories about how Edward
Bernays created the idea of public relations.So one of the stories he tells is about "Torches of Freedom".  So this
was an ad campaign to break the taboo against women smoking.  At the
time, men would smoke and it was acceptable to some degree.  And
women, it was very looked down upon.  So the president of the American
Tobacco Company said, "If we can break this taboo, it will be like a
gold mine opening right in our front yard."[Time 0:26:15]So he hires Edward Bernays, and what Edward Bernays does is: he hires
women who are good looking, but not too model-y -- that is the quote I
found: "good looking, but not too model-y" -- to walk in the Easter
Sunday parade, and smoke.  He also hired photographers to get really
good photos of these women, and then distribute those photos through
newspaper connections that he had, to make sure they got published all
around the world.So this Torches of Freedom idea was saying: we see this trend about
women's liberation happening, and like, this is aligned with that
movement, in that this is a way of punching up against those taboos.
But it is very focused on like, hey, we are going to make a bunch of
money here.[Time 0:27:03]And so one of the ads that came out of this was "An Ancient Prejudice
Has Been Removed".  And what is interesting about this ad is that,
visually, it is clearly about women smoking, but textually it is
saying: toasting did it.  It is because they toast the tobacco, it is
less harsh on your throat, and that is what has removed the prejudice.
So textually they can say: look, we are not getting into politics.  We
are just saying that toasting is cool, and that is a lady who smokes.
It is like: I don't see the problem.  But meanwhile, you have hired
Edward Bernays to actually run this campaign.Oh yeah, I want to read a little bit from his book.  This is the book.
He says:"The old fashioned propagandist, using almost exclusively the
appeal to the printed word, tried to persuade the individual
reader to buy a definite article immediately."So his example of this is like: "You buy O'Leary's rubber bands now!"
And he is like: "That is the old fashioned way."[Time 0:28:10]
"The modern propagandist therefore sets to work to create the
circumstances that will modify the custom."It doesn't matter what this ad says.  It is about creating
circumstances such that the custom will change in whatever direction
someone pays me to change it.So another example he gives is for Mozart Pianos.  So I do not know
exactly the finances of Mozart Pianos, but let us say they had 30 per
cent of the market share, and he gets hired to make it higher, maybe
it can go up to 35 or 40.  That would be huge for Mozart Pianos.So Bernays comes in and he says: "OK, I could say to people 'Will you
please buy a piano?'.  But I am not going to do that.  I know that
pianos have this kind of elite cachet.  And so what I am going to do
is: I am going to make an architecture expo in New York City where we
are going to showcase music parlors, and we are going to bring in
famous people, influential artists, and musicians to be in the rooms.
We are going to have expensive tapestries, and really lean in to this
elite picture, and promote it in our connections with newspapers.[Time 0:29:15]He also invites architects from all over the country.  He wants
influential architects.  And they will bring designs for music
parlors.  So what this expo does is: it creates a music parlor as an
aspirational goal.  And it brings in architects, who will then go back
to wherever they are from, with designs for music parlors.  And they
will start building houses that have that, and ideally they will
influence other architects, who are not as influential, to add music
parlors as well.And so instead of saying, "Hey will you please buy this piano?"
people are now saying, "Hey, I have this piano shaped hole that I need
to fill?  Do you have something piano-shaped?"So again, the modern propagandist sets to work to create the
circumstances that will modify the custom.So this got modernized and sort of made a bit nicer in Nudge.  So here
we see a nudge is any aspect of a choice architecture that will alter
people's behavior in a predictable way, without forbidding any options
or significantly changing their economic incentives.[Time 0:30:17]So this book has been really influential in tech recently.  So one
thing that we are probably all familiar with that is an example of
this is auto play of videos.  So you just finished a show.  It ends on
a cliffhanger because they wrote it that way.  And you are like, man,
that was cool.  And you are like, oh, my body.  Is it hungry?  Does it
need a walk?  Did it have plans for today?  Or for anything?  And then
the music starts again, and you are like: No.  Ooohhh.So this is a nudge, right?  You are free to do some other behavior,
but through the choice architecture that was created, a predictable
amount of people do not make that free choice.[Time 0:31:13]So this ended up being popular at Google.  So if anyone has visited
Google cafeterias, you will probably have seen that all of the food
has been marked with colors.  So green means "eat any time", yellow
means "once in a while", red means "not often, please".  And it is all
marked.  It is actually helpful.  You can be like "Oh, I just had
one red thing today!"  It is kind of nice.But this interest in colors changing people's behavior was used at
Google in other ways.  So when you look at the history of their ad
labeling, you see something similar.  So when ads started, they sort
of just started by playing around with colors.  So maybe green is,
like, fun, or maybe this lavender purple thing is the way to go.So in a new phase of things you start to see: OK, well let's .. can it
be something more white?  Well maybe a little more white, you know?
Well how about something like a little more white.  Instead of all of
these colors, let us just put it all in one place.  Take all of the
saturation, put it in one place.  And like, hey, it works fine.  No
problem.[Time 0:32:25]And then it is like, well, yellow is pretty ugly.  We could just
... it is still labeled.  It is no problem.  And then it is like, I
mean, who wanted it to be yellow?  It was not really that important.
And then, it is like, you know, the background ...  I mean, people get
it.  They get it.So when you search for "Italy tour", for example, everything above the
fold is an ad, and it is labeled in this very, you know, subtle and
nice way.So I found this very interesting quote from the head of text ads at
Google.  He says "we want to make it easier for users to digest
information on the page, so we are gradually trying to reduce the
number of variations of colors and patterns on the page, and bring a
little bit more harmony to the page."  Like, "we just want harmony".
And that is why we reduced one of the color elements on the page.  We
could have reduced other color elements.  It is just one color
element.  What is the big deal?[Time 0:33:35]So some of you may be thinking, "Evan, if you are so mad about this,
why don't you just change your default search?"  Like you typed it
into Safari, so clearly that is the default.  Well, another thing I
learned when I was looking into this is: Google paid one billion to
Apple to keep the search bar on iPhones.  Furthermore, these sums,
called "traffic acquisition costs", rose to 5.5 billion dollars, or 23
per cent of ad revenue.So we are in a situation where a choice architecture has been created.
The circumstances have been modified such that well, I don't mind
searching in this way.  Or, I could scroll down below these ads, but I
don't really want to.  So the circumstances have been created such
that custom is modified.  And if we wanted to mess with this, it is
going to cost a lot of money.  The fact that DuckDuckGo exists,
doesn't mean that they can compete with these kinds of numbers.[Time 0:34:37]So I think this whole intellectual lineage leads to something that we
see in on-line communities a lot, which is: things are viral by
design.  So when Bernays starts an advertising campaign, all these
stories he tells, he always starts with a psychological hook.  So you
might observe that people process emotions by sharing them with
others.So that might look like, someone is going about their day.  It is
fine.  And someone shows up, and they are like, "That work you did
last week, it was terrible.  It is not going to work out.  It was
really not carefully considered."  And that person feels sad.  And the
person yelling at them goes away.So they might mope around for a day, or however long.  And hopefully
they run into a friend who hears this story and says, "Aw, man.  That
sucks, but I don't think that was really a fair assessment."  And
through talking it through, the person can sort of deal with that and
move through.[Time 0:35:36]Another interaction that might be possible is: you are going about
your day, and someone says, "Did you hear about that terrible thing
that is happening over there?"  And you say, "Woah, that is terrible!"
And then you see a friend and you say "Hey, did you hear about that?"
And they are like, "Ah!  That's terrible!"  And they see some of their
friends.  And they are like, "Man, that thing over there is really
bad!"  Viral!So when we are choosing what kind of messages we want to put into
society to control it, as the cyberneticists might say, this one has a
very interesting pattern.  So when you get something that has a viral
reaction, that is something that has more engagement.  And a lot of
people who are running Silicon Valley companies in an idealistic way.
They want to make the world better through tools, they are put in this
choice architecture.  Well, you have these investors, and you don't
want to disappoint them.  There are all of these people who work at
your company.  You don't want to lay them off.  So do you want hash
tag disappointing Q3?  Or do you want the viral one?[Time 0:36:40]So once you have this psychological hook, you can start designing ways
to make it work better.  So the ones I have sort of noticed have been
to mix extremes.  So if we come back to our priorities graph of
different people.  These people do not necessarily congregate in the
same place, but what we really want to happen is for the most extreme
people to yell at each other as aggressively as possible.  And so one
way to do that might be to put all of the different programming
communities in one place.So if you look at different on line discussion forums, I think the
degree to which different communities collide will predict the amount
of conflict you see there.  So Hacker News, I find that most difficult
and most combative place.  And then on r/Programming
[reddit.com/r/Programming] you will see more of that, and on the
subreddits for individual languages you will see less.  On places that
are just community places, that do not have accounts that are shared
between, you will see less.[Time 0:37:45]So another approach is to decontextualize the person.  So instead of
two people talking, you have "tangodango" talking to "foxtrot".  And
what is interesting here is like, when they saw each other's faces
they might be able to say, "Oh, this person is not trying to be
malicious.  They feel this way."  But when it is "tangodango", it
could literally be Hitler.  It could.  You don't know.  He is in
Argentina just being like, "infix operators are stupid".  "Unclean!"So another way to decontextualize things is to limit the amount of
characters that are available to people.  Another way is to limit the
kind of feedback that is available.  So instead of saying, "Hey, that
was pretty hurtful", you say "down!".  Like a lot of nuance is lost in
that sort of thing.[Time 0:38:38]So when I take a step back on all of this, I think there is a big
conflict here where there are very powerful incentives for our
interactions to go really poorly.  And I do not think the intellectual
history of freedom is really well set up to protect against that.
Like if you are living in a choice architecture that predictably
alters people's behavior, yeah, you were given a free choice, but you
happened to choose a different thing 30 per cent of the time.So this got me interested in a different pathway.  So I ask a lot,
"Why don't I have any of these problems in person?"  So like at work,
or at conferences, or at meetups, or on the street.  All of these
places are for something.  So when a place is for something, you can
ask, "What is inappropriate behavior?"If I am at work and a discussion keeps going and going, at some point
we have to stop having the discussion and make a choice.  We cannot be
in discussion forever.  It is clear because at work is for work.[Time 0:39:40]And at a conference it is against the norms to jump up on a stage and
be like, "That is wrong!"  The idea is that you carefully select
speakers who might have something interesting to say to folks, and try
to officially, and in a nice way, present that.At a meetup, if someone is being really aggressive, there are ways to
say, "aaahhh, I need to go to the bathroom".  There are ways out of
those kinds of conflicts, and you are talking face to face.  On the
street someone is like standing outside of Starbucks and being like,
"I had better coffee one time", that is weird.  That is weird
behavior.  "And the croissants could be done better.  I don't know
how, but they could.  This isn't it."[Time 0:40:32]So this idea of a place being for something, I think is really
important.  And so I had this idea for intentional communication.  And
so the idea is that instead of just having a blank box you write into,
you first choose some intent.  My intent is to learn, let us say.  And
I will get prompted to, say, "what is your background?"  Maybe they
just started using Elm, and they have been using Java for a long time.
And the question is, "Why do I have to explicitly cast between Int and
Float when doing math?"  And then I can submit the post.So when that shows up, this question might have been read in a
combative way.  Like [said in a frustrated or bitter way]: "Why do I
have to explicitly cast between Int and Float when doing math?"  Or
[stated in kind, calm, curious tone]: "Why do I have to explicitly
cast between Int and Float ...".  Both of those are valid
interpretations of this text.  But when you give some background, it
is like, "OK, I see where this person is coming from.  I can see why
they would be frustrated with that."  And so it is way harder to read
it in a malicious way.So instead of just having a "reply" button, maybe you can say, "OK, I
can either ask for clarification, or I can give an answer".  And so if
I say I am going to give an answer, again we might have this
structured way of replying.  Restate the question, answer it, and
then, hey we value citations.  People backing up with evidence or
experience, so maybe they give a citation.  And they can post it.[Time 0:41:49]And so again you get the answer.  And the person asking says, "Oh,
that is not the question I was asking, actualy."  So that can really
help clarify and make this process more efficient.  And so again,
instead of reply, maybe you say, "ask for clarification", or thank the
person.And so there are a couple of things you can add to this that I think
would help.  So one is the idea of conversation flows.  So we saw
someone wants to learn, you can clarify or answer.  If they choose to
answer, they can ask a clarifying question, or thank you.  Now if they
clarify, maybe you give another answer.  But in the other path, "Hey,
maybe you can give me an example to clarify your question", they can
restate it, and then you can answer.  So the point here is just that
"Yell angrily" is not one of the states in the discussion flow.  It is
unreachable.[Time 0:42:42]So this isn't to say that all discussions should be this way, because
there are places where you want self-expression.  You say, "Hey, I had
a really nice time at the park.  Here is a photo of it".  And someone
says, "Oh, that is great.  That reminds me of last week.  We were
cooking something really nice."And so you can have these cycles.  But when someone is doing
self-expression, and you say, "Man, that is really like a terrible
thing to say", maybe you could have this conversation flow that says,
"Hey, I want to learn about that perspective.  I don't want to tell
you it is wrong, I just want to know why you feel that way."So what might be interesting here is, the discussion flows will be
different depending on the goals of the community.  If it is about
learning it might be one way.  If it is about self-expression it might
be another way.  And maybe you want safety valves to jump around.So another thing that I think is interesting is, say discussion is
happening, and it is getting really out of control, and it is like,
"Hey, this is nice", and by the end they are like, "Your Mom is a bad
person, and she threw a bicycle on the ground".  I don't know.  So
this is where you really don't really want things to go.[Time 0:43:46]So one thing that might be interesting is when you see someone about
to reply, you say, "Hey, what would be a successful conclusion to this
interaction?"  Or, "Would it be easier to chat for five minutes?"  Is
there somewhere to take this that is going to be more constructive.
What do you want to get out of this?Another thing that might be really valuable.  So we talked about up
vote, down vote stuff.  When someone gets down voted, they think to
themselves, "These are people who just can't take it.  I outsmarted
them, and they can't accept that."  But the people might actually be
saying, "Man, that was pretty rude and uncalled for."  And so that
feedback is not reaching that person that may feel increasingly
alienated by these kinds of reactions.  Furthermore, these buttons
sort of uniquely pick out, "Oh, I'm mad", or "Oh, I like that".So what we might be able to do instead is say, "Hey, for any post,
here are a couple of things you might notice about it."  Is it off
topic?  Is it helpful?  And if the goal of the place is to help
professionals, maybe these are the ones you want to choose.But if the goal is helping beginners, maybe you want to choose "Scary"
vs. "Encouraging", or "Confusing" vs. "Clear".  And if the place is
about self-expression, maybe you want to choose "Funny" and "Downer".[Time 0:44:57]So there are a bunch of extras.  I am running out of time, so I am
going to skip, but there are a lot of cool things to do here.So some people may be looking at this and thinking, "If a planned
culture necessarily meant uniformity ..."  Like all of this planning
is going to ruin these communities.  So I found this book.  It says:"If planned culture necessarily meant uniformity or regimentation,
it might indeed work against further evolution.  If men were very
much alike, they would be less likely to hit upon or design new
practices, and a culture which made people as much alike as
possible might slip into a standard pattern from which there would
be no escape.  That would be bad design, but if we are looking for
variety, we should not fall back upon accident.  Many accidental
cultures have been marked by uniformity and regimentation."So this is from a book called "Beyond Freedom and Dignity" by
B. F. Skinner.  And I think this is one of the clearest books that is
recognizing that there are these people who understand choice
architectures, and that freedom does not help you escape from choice
architectures.  Design of other choice architectures is a way to deal
with that.[Time 0:46:02]So ultimately I am not here to say that, "Here is one way that is
right, or the others."  People are going to have different priorities
depending upon their life and their experiences.  I think the point
that is important is that there are a lot of people in open source
communities who are getting hurt.  So it is hard emotionally to work
on these kinds of projects.  You see people around you getting hurt.
And just saying, "Well, people are just expressing themselves" isn't
solving the question, and we have these very influential people
controlling billions of dollars who have particular goals for what
happens in these communities.So I hope that is an interesting way to think about the hard parts of
open source, and I have a bunch of references if you are interested in
looking back on things.  And I hope people will explore, through
programming, like creating the communities that we talked about.
Maybe exploring intentional communication.  And maybe it will be
beautiful.  Maybe people won't use it.  Maybe people will use it and
then it will just become another tool for engagement.  That's likely.
We will see, but thank you very much for your attention and
consideration.[Time 0:47:09]#clippingKeep in touch!

 Ode to Audio: Why You Should Give Podcasts and Audiobooks a Chance

                  Ode to Audio: Why You Should Give Podcasts and Audiobooks a Chance
                  

August 25th, 2016

I love doing chores. The more time-consuming they are, the better. I jump at opportunities to empty the dishwasher, and grocery shopping is a highlight of my week. I don’t even mind sorting the trash, as long as I have my phone and some earbuds handy.
I used to dread housework as much as the next person. But that all changed when John introduced me to podcasts and audiobooks two years ago. Mundane tasks have become opportunities to learn, to relax, and to listen to stories I might never hear otherwise.
Digital audio is one of the best additions I’ve made to my life recently — a newfound love of chores is far from the only benefit of podcasts and audiobooks. Naturally, I want to share it with other people. In an effort to pay it forward, I’ve compiled a list of reasons for why on-demand audio is great. If you’re already convinced, check out my starter kit to see a list of recommendations.

1. Audio improves the routine parts of life
Digital audio enables me to enjoy books and news that I may never have the opportunity to read otherwise.Some portion of everyone’s day is devoted to bland but necessary activities. We all have to shower, commute, and run errands. These repetitive tasks consume lots of our time, to the exclusion of other things we care about. Podcasts and audiobooks help you make the most of your time.I am now able to read or listen to several books each month with this new habit. Before, I only managed to fit in a handful each year, maybe a dozen if I was lucky.Of course listening is not the same as reading. I get about 80% of the comprehension from substituting an audiobook for its printed text equivalent. However, this is well worth it. Since audio helps me fill gaps of intellectual stimulation, it acts more as a supplement to my existing reading habits rather than as a substitute.2. Audio is intellectually humble
Audio is inherently conversational, even with the most polished and edited shows. As a result, podcasts tend to be more of an exploration of ideas rather than a presentation of an argument. It is easier to discuss complex ideas without feeling the need to oversimplify or to stake your identity to a specific argument. This is something Ezra Klein mentions frequently in Vox’s The Weeds and his own show:"There is a subtle but very powerful incentive towards coherence imposed by most of the formats in which we write. With [podcasts], you can be a little rambling. You don’t have to have just one point, people are open to you just making a bunch of points and then at the end just moving on and not wrapping things up in a bow." ~ Ezra Klein (from "Malcolm Gladwell on the danger of joining consensus opinions")And Gladwell’s response in that same episode:"The minute something is on paper, it has a kind of permanence, an authority that maybe it doesn’t deserve." ~ Malcolm GladwellIt’s interesting to compare this to blogs. Podcasts and blogs have a lot in common: they are both created by an individual or small group whose personality drives the content, they both have a defined topic scope, and they both have a malleable style rather than following strict conventions. But they feel totally different — podcasts are conversational and exploratory, while blogs have a distinct perspective that they intend to communicate.
Either format can achieve both goals, but the implicit intention when not otherwise stated varies greatly between the two media. If a blog post begins with a disclaimer that its purpose is to test out a few ideas or play Devil’s Advocate, then the author can continue with the understanding that that’s what the (s)he is doing. Similarly, if a podcaster explicitly states a strong argument at the beginning and continues to hammer down point after point, it is clear that they are trying to communicate a certain view of the world. However, the audience has come to expect blogs and podcasts to be more persuasive and exploratory, respectively, because that is what each medium subtly encourages.

3. Low exploration cost
One of the best features of podcasts is that they are free. I’m not just being cheap — this is an important feature of the medium, because it means that it is low cost to try something new. Many of my favorite shows were ones I originally subscribed to on a whim, just because the description caught my eye or because I had a random impulse to learn about a particular subject. Because they’re free, I am far more willing to try out a show whose topic is outside of my usual range of interests, and that range has expanded as a result.
A few examples:A few months ago, I went through a phase where I was obsessed with Singapore. Towards the beginning of that phase, I subscribed to a handful of podcasts about the country (e.g. The History of Singapore, Singapore Uncensored, Inconvenient Questions, Singapore). They weren’t all great, but a few of them played a large role in fueling my month-long obsession with the city-state. If they hadn’t been free, I would have been far less likely to dive into the subject, because at that point I didn’t even know enough about why Singapore was interesting to justify buying a $20 book.Gastropod is another good example of this. I’ve historically found cooking shows and blogs to be fairly boring, useful for one-off recipes but not my idea of solid entertainment or a place to learn. As a result, I would have been extremely unlikely to pay for a subscription to Gastropod in the beginning. However, I gave one episode a chance because it had potential, and giving it a try had no cost besides a few minutes of my time. Now Gastropod is one of my favorite shows, and I even made a donation to the show because they do such great work.
4. Certain stories are best communicated through audio
Audio is an extremely intimate medium. It feels like the speaker is talking right to you as an individual.
This is especially true of podcasts, which usually take on a conversational tone. It feels like the driving force behind the show is the personality of the individual podcaster rather than some publishing behemoth. Even the most heavily edited and well-polished shows feel like they’re handmade just for you by a close friend.Audio is a whole new way to learn about the world. First-hand accounts, interviews with experts, and the host’s own excitement bring seemingly boring topics to life. The conversational tone of most podcasts makes it feel like you’re there with the host, seeing what they’re seeing and discovering new things along with them.Planet Money does a particularly good job of this. They use this intimate, conversational tone to communicate abstract concepts about the world economy in a fun, accessible way. For example, in 2013 they made a T-shirt and documented each step of the process in 5 chapters, from a cotton field in Mississippi to a factory in Bangladesh and finally to a used clothes bin in sub-Saharan Africa.Some journalists started podcasting as a way to allow readers to enjoy articles on-the-go. This was a valuable service, but the medium has since developed its own way of telling stories, distinct from the written word. Podcasts blend the capabilities of the serialized, RSS format with old school radio techniques.Serial is the classic example of this. (I have to admit I’ve never actually listened to the show, but I’ve heard it’s gripping.) The general idea is that it narrates a nonfiction story in weekly installments, borrowing techniques from radio, investigative journalism, and serialized television as well as blending in elements enabled to the form of podcasts. The Serial website explains, "Sarah [the host] and her team follow the plot and characters wherever they take them wherever they take them, and they won’t know what happens at the end of the story until they get there."The first season of StartUp Podcast was a sort of audio diary from Alex Blumberg while he was in the process of starting a podcasting company called Gimlet Media. When he released the first episode, he hadn’t raised any money, he had no cofounder, and the company didn’t have a name. Over the course of the show, listeners got to follow his growth from being a public radio producer into the role of startup founder. I felt lucky that I discovered the show while he was still creating it, because it was so much fun to follow his company’s growth in real time. I now feel bought into Gimlet’s success as if it were one of my friend’s companies, and I’ve subscribed to every single one of the podcasts they’ve produced since the company was founded two years ago.Audiobooks have seen a similar transition, away from simply readings of text and towards performances designed specifically for the recorded medium. Audio adaptation can bring a whole new dimension to literature.The audiobook for Philip Pullman’s The Golden Compass is a stunning work of art in its own right. It is narrated by the author, and each character in the story is voiced by a different actor from a London Shakespeare troupe. I adored the printed book, re-reading it at least half a dozen times when I was younger, but the audiobook might be even better.One of the best parts of family road trips was our tradition of listening to The Green Hand ghost tales when I was a kid. The storyteller’s performance was at least as important as the stories themselves, and he made the most of his medium rather than reciting them from his book.Audio of course has its weaknesses. It is not as good as text or video for diving into the details. In fact, I seek out transcripts, paper, or Kindle editions as a companion to many audiobooks, because it’s hard to digest the minutia of an intricate argument or resurface details later.

5. Audio allows you to explore both depth & breadth
Audio is a great way to explore disciplines, places, and ideas you might never otherwise learn about.
The breadth of podcasts is astonishing. Here is a small sampling from my subscriptions, which doesn’t even begin to do justice to the immense diversity in podcasting:The Inquiry — the BBC World Service interviews four expert witnesses about a pressing question from the newsGastropod — a show about "food with a side of science & history"Rationally Speaking — New York City Skeptics hosts guests as they "explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense, likely from unlikely"Tumble Science Podcast — a kid-friendly (and adult-friendly!) science podcast emphasizing discoveryImaginary Worlds — a podcast about science fiction and other fantasy genres, "how we create them and why we suspend our disbelief"EconTalk — the Hoover Institute’s talk show about economics in daily lifeNews in Slow Spanish — a show to help you practice your Spanish comprehension skillsThe History of Singapore — a show that traces the history of the city-state from its colonial past up to the modern dayDirect Current — a podcast form the U.S. Department of Energy that explores how energy shapes our world… I’m tempted to go on, but you can just look at the OPML file (or the more readable JSON) in the starter kit.This is where podcasts blow public radio out of the water. I love NPR and its member stations, but that model could simply never support this range or depth with its geographically-limited model. For a particular community or region, only the most general topics have enough local interest to build a base of listeners of any reasonable size, and the talent pool for creating that content is limited. In contrast, podcasts can be created by and for anybody, anywhere, which increases the size of the market and raises quality of the best shows. Public radio still has a role to play — in fact NPR shows like Planet Money and Invisibilia are some of my favorite shows — but the world of audio is even better now that they aren’t the only players in the game.
Individual shows go into incredible depth within their specific domain. Shows are usually hosted by experts rather than journalists, and they’re friends with the other people doing interesting things within that domain. As a result, podcasts feel a lot more like you’re shadowing someone in their daily work than just a small, mediated window into their world.For example, The Psychology of Attractiveness is hosted by Robert Burriss, a professor of psychology at Basel University in Switzerland. In the show, he presents the cutting edge in his field as well as his own original research every once in a while. He’s extremely knowledgeable about the domain, and he manages to make a potentially dry topic fun and accessible to non-scientists without losing its rigor or depth.Podcasts have helped me appreciate how seemingly small niches are a fractal of undiscovered wisdom. As a software engineer, it’s easy for me to be consumed by programming and computer science concepts, to think that those ideas are the most important thing in the world. I’m not wrong in placing a lot of importance on these concepts, but podcasts have made me realize that other people are just as consumed by their work, which I may know nothing about.Gastropod’s episode called "The Mushroom Underground" is a great example of this. I previously thought of mushrooms as something I cook sometimes, and sure it’s probably some farmer’s livelihood, but it’s just like any other produce when it comes down to it. Then I listened to this episode, which dove into the weird world of fungi. It turns out that the science and history of mushrooms is fascinating. The hosts visited the U.S. National Fungus Collection, home to a million unique specimens, and the toured a boutique mushroom farm. Then, they uncovered the long history of mushroom consumption and cultivation, and they learned about how personalized mushroom therapeutics might be ale to combat antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases. I still don’t want to become a mushroom farmer or scientist, but I have a whole new appreciation for fungi and the people that work with them.Audiobooks don’t have the breadth of printed books, since recorded adaptations make up just a slice of the total number of published books, but that’s more a function of how many books there are in the world. Many of the books I want to read have audio formats, and new editions are coming out all of the time. Audible’s recommendation system is similar to that of Amazon’s book recommendations, which I’ve always found to be extremely useful. (Audible is an Amazon subsidiary, so it probably is the same system.)

6. Podcasts and audiobooks can be a virtuous reward
It can be hard to motivate yourself to make healthy choices. After a long day of work, it’s tempting to convince yourself that just one hour of TV will help you unwind, and then after that you’ll definitely go for a run. Now that I have podcasts and audiobooks, the run itself is my reward. It’s an opportunity to get back to find out what happens next in the story or to hear your favorite podcast host serve up some knowledge about how the world works.

7. We’re in an audio renaissance
Podcasting is in an exciting experimental stage. It broke out of the niche corners of the internet in the last few years, and it’s fun to watch the medium change, mature, and grow. Most forms of publishing have been around for generations, so this is a unique opportunity to experience an emerging media industry.Because digital audio is in an experimental stage, its content tends to be meta and self-referential. There is a thriving genre of podcasts about the podcasting industry, and they’re fun to follow as an industry outsider. Gimlet’s StartUp podcast explored the angle of starting a podcast company, while other shows like The Pub analyze industry trends and On the Media claims to be "your guide to how the media sausage is made".The podcasting industry is in the process of ironing out ethical guidelines, and it’s fascinating to watch as different groups come up with their own solutions in real time.One of my favorite episodes of any show was StartUp’s "We Made A Mistake", where Gimlet Media’s team discusses and owns a huge screw up and establishes advertising guidelines.I also recommend Hot Pod, a weekly newsletter about the podcasting industry. This one isn’t a podcast or audiobook, but it offers a fascinating pulse on the state of digital audio.If you’ve made it this far, then you’re probably interested in giving podcasts and audiobooks a try, or you’re looking for recommendations for more shows and books to listen to. If so, check out my digital audio starter kit. And please don’t hesitate to let me know what you think or send me your own suggestions!

This essay was written by Andrew Kortina and Namrata Patel.

Kinky (S1) vs classical (S0) labor supply curve.Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.
At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.#Declining Labor Participation in Younger DemographicsThe overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:

Labor Participation Rate via Bureau of Labor Statistics.Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. (Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).
In Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:
Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.#Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media EntertainmentVideo games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.
For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.
The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.
This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.
All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.#Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption GoodsBefore we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.
In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.#What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.
Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).
As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.
If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his review of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class that:
This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on "cultural capital"—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may "only" cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces."The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.
The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, Every Cradle is a Grave:
More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least it was possible when you sought that social belonging from people and communities that were more geographically constrained.#How does scale of distribution impact conspicuous consumption?Consumers are no longer signaling on a local scale, but rather on an internet scale. On the one hand, this amplifies signal, because you can reach likeminded people who aren’t part of your local community, but on the other hand:The consequent noise of everyone else doing the same thing crowds that signal out.The people you may be trying to reach may be more preoccupied than ever before given the media dynamics described above playing out.Together, these changes increase competition for the attention of the people whose attention you’re vying for…And stoke an arms race in money and time in pursuit of relative conspicuous consumption.As an example, consider how this increased competition plays out in online dating platforms. On Tinder, the top 20% of men are competing for the top 78% of women. Why? It’s a matter of the breadth of selection. Offline, due to the constraints of physical space and time, any given woman would have a finite set of potential partners to choose from. Online, the selection is much more vast and most women only "like" the most attractive men. The Gini coefficient for the "Tinder economy" is 0.58, which means that it has higher inequality than 95% the world’s national economies – in other words, it’s pretty grim if you’re a man in the bottom 80%.
We believe that this effect can be extrapolated into most contexts where digital distribution is used for signalling purposes. Yes, you could work more in order to buy more consumption goods, services, and activities and spend more of your free time posting about it online in order to break through, but it’s a grind given the ever-escalating, relative nature of the competition.
Unless the lottery or a new work opportunity vaults you into the top 20% of income earners or you’re fine spending the majority of your time crafting your online image like the Maya Millenials out there, you have little chance of breaking through. And if there is no meaningful signalling utility from the consumption goods, services, and activities you could buy with increased income, why work more than you need to meet your basic needs and fund leisure? Paul Nystrom dubbed consumerism as a "philosophy of futility," and with the Internet stoking conspicuous consumption into overdrive, more people may be starting to sense that.#What are the implications of worker preference for leisure over wages?A common response to a high unemployment rate, low labor force participation, and low economic productivity is the proposal of increasing wages / the minimum wage. This proposal stems from the idea in classical economics that there is a smooth, upward sloping labor supply curve, where each increase in wages yields a corresponding increase in labor supply (because the higher wages entice more people to work or people to work more hours):

Classical labor supply and demand equilibrium.The shape of this curve is a function of the marginal utility of higher income to each worker, which looks like the following:

Marginal utility of higher income, classical.The assumption here is that each additional dollar of income is increasingly useful to a worker, because it enables the purchase of more basic goods, leisure goods, and consumption goods.
Just as there is a ceiling to the amount of income which can be spent on basic goods (food, shelter, etc), we posit that, given our above discussion, there are now natural ceilings on the amount of income which most workers will spend on leisure goods and conspicuous consumption goods.
First, the ceiling on income useful for purchasing leisure goods is the monthly cost of an ISP or cellular data plan (along with the cost of the hardware used to access the internet).
Second, the ceiling on income useful for conspicuous consumption is effectively zero – until you reach the ‘power threshold’ where you can spend enough to distinguish yourself as part of the top 20% of spenders, which is incredibly high. Every extra dollar of income you earn below this power threshold is effectively useless for the sake of conspicuous consumption, because on a relative basis it’s not enough to out-signal the ‘best.’
We propose, therefore, that the utility of marginal income actually looks like this:

The solid line depicts zero marginal utility of increased income once you have met basic needs and subscription cost of infinite media entertainment, up to the point where you break back into the top 20%.And, as a result, there is a ‘kinky labor supply curve:’

Firms unable to meet demand for labor due to ceiling on wage elasticity.The classical labor supply curve would intersect the labor demand curve at (E0), and although the kinky labor supply curve intersects the labor demand curve at (E2), firms can decrease wages from here without decreasing productive output, all the way down to the actual equilibrium point at (E1). This suboptimal equilibrium entails that:There is lower employment, which is a deadweight loss to the economy (lower overall economic output). There is actually greater demand for labor than can be met, but there’s no way to realize it because marginal increases in wages yield no increase in supply of labor past the equilibrium point (E1).Wages are lower, which is an effective economic transfer from labor to firms. Firms would actually be willing to pay higher wages to the workers they employ, but because this would not yield more hours of labor, firms do not increase wages, so every hour of labor performed by a worker is paid at a lower wage rate than workers would earn at the classical equilibrium point.A compounding factor worth noting here is the gig economy and the increase in availability of on-demand work, which helps workers realize a much more continuous distribution of preferences for allocating time across work and leisure (vs their ability to historically do so, which would have been more discrete / discontinuous). The gig economy makes labor supply more elastic at the lower, leftmost portion of the labor supply curve and removes what you might think of as a floor on labor supply that was imposed by the standard forty hour work week. (h/t Sam Lessin for calling our attention to the gig economy as another pressure on labor supply.)#The Kinky Labor Supply Curve Results in Lower Overall Economic OutputBecause the demand for labor exceeds what workers are willing to supply, production and overall economic output are lower when workers prefer media entertainment leisure over wages.
You might argue this is a good thing. People actually prefer to spend their time consuming media over working, and we have achieved the luxury of enabling them to act on this preference. And, when people primarily consume digital media goods, the result is the production and consumption of less physical trash.
On the other hand, you might argue that lower economic output is a bad thing. Historically, economic growth has raised standards of living, increased lifespan, and has generally enabled more stable societies that are more insulated from the volatility of nature (eg, locusts eating an entire season of crops).
If you’re in the camp that thinks lower economic output is bad, the natural follow-up question is what kind of policy changes might counteract this phenomenon.#Policies for the Leisure StateIf firms are unable to generate increases in labor supply by increasing wages, government transfers to workers would be be an equally ineffective solution when workers value leisure time over increased purchasing power. This entails that the possible solution space is probably limited to taxes (and probably does not include, for example, things like wage subsidies or an increased minimum wage).
One potential solution would be to tax the unproductive leisure activities which people prefer over work. This is perhaps not as crazy as it seems, because (i) the true cost of these activities is already distorted from a consumer perspective by the advertisers who subsidize media consumption,and (ii) we already tax income and productivity – if time and money are fungible, you might just pull the idea of income tax ‘above’ the decision of how to spend time, and say that each person is responsible for investing some amount of sweat (in the form of time or money) into the public good.
Of course it would be impossible to gain political support for such a radical idea, especially when people today enjoy leisure time for free. No one would support a policy that required them to buy this time back from the state in the form of a tax.
Since media companies are capitalizing and profiting on a huge amount of attention that might otherwise be spent productively, however, taxing them for the share of the citizenry’s time that they consume could be more sensible and more practical than taxing citizens themselves.
One view of the status quo is that media companies are aggregating human attention and selling it at a discount–far below minimum wage–to advertisers in a massive arbitrage on human capital. So, the state could set the price of an hour of human attention at the minimum wage rate, and charge media companies 12% (the federal income tax rate on minimum wage) of that wage rate for each hour of human attention they consume.
Media companies would respond in one of two ways, because they no doubt earn nowhere close to the amount of profit they would need to pay this tax. They could charge more to advertisers, ending the current price arbitrage on human attention. Or, they could pass the cost on to consumers directly, charging per unit of consumption instead of offering infinite consumption for a fixed price.#Why limit the attention tax to media companies vs all providers of leisure goods?It seems a bit odd to single out consumption of digital media as a uniquely taxable leisure activity – why not tax all leisure activities?
What’s attractive about restricting the tax to digital media companies is that (i) they are profiting on the captured attention already and (ii) consumption of digital media is highly measurable. One of the challenges of the attention tax is measurement, and probably one of the reasons we have never considered such a tax viable in the past is the challenge of enforceability – it would be impossible for the state to measure the difference at a per citizen level of a productive unpaid hour (eg, care for a child or elderly person) from a leisure hour (spent reading a physical book).
While today it would still be difficult for the state to account for every hour of each citizen’s time, it would be quite feasible to measure each person’s hours of attention that were definitely spent consuming digital media entertainment. Taxing only these hours would be both practical and meaningful in terms of total percentage of time measured and enforceable in practice.#TakeawaysWhile it is fun to explore alternative mechanisms for motivating the labor force if labor supply no longer responds to increases in wages, it is far more likely that lost worker productivity will be made up for with technology (eg, automation via robotics, software, artificial intelligence) that makes remaining workers more productive. While this would lead to a host of other problems (eg, inequality) and almost certainly lead to a welfare state, it is probably more straightforward to implement the necessary technological advances than the attention tax. Furthermore, a welfare state where most people could devote most of their time to the pursuit of leisure seems to be more consistent with preferences revealed by recent trends in labor participation and alternative uses of time.#taxes

Attenuation and the suck threshold
How long do your users spend in the "I suck" (or "this product sucks") zone? Once they've crossed the suck threshold, how long does it take before they start to feel like they kick ass? Both of those thresholds are key milestones on a users path to passion, and it's often the case that he-who-gets-his-users-there-first wins.
Our O'Reilly editor Mike Loukides says our goal -- whether it's for product design or writing a tech book -- should be to focus on answering this question:What is the minimum threshold at which the user can be creative?Followed by:Do whatever it takes to help them get there quickly.And by "creative", he doesn't mean "be artistic". He means, "be able to apply the tool or knowledge or skill to do something useful or fun that they find meaningful or interesting." A long learning curve before true mastery is achieved is not the problem. The real problem is when there's a long learning curve just to get past the "I suck" (or, "this product sucks") zone, and a long curve before crossing the "Hey, I'm actually starting to kick ass at this!" threshold.

For most of us, our user wants to use our tools (software, books, sermons, screwdrivers, saddle, music) to do something else (collaborate electronically, learn, find inspiration, build a deck, ride a horse, dance). So we try to think about the thing they want to do, and how quickly we can get them through those two thresholds:1) The suck threshold 
The point at which they stop hating you (your company), the activity itself, or their complete inability to do anything useful.2) The passion threshold
The point at which they start feeling like they kick ass. While passion is not a guarantee at this point, the chances of someone becoming passionate before this are slim.And it's not always about the product--sometimes it's all about framing, documentation, and learning. It's about [straps self into buzzword appreciation chair] attenuation. Turning down the gain. Narrowing. Focusing.
Or as O'Reilly's Rael Dornfest puts it:
"...bandwidth continues to broaden, cycles are going spare, storage grows ever larger and cheaper, and content keeps pouring from the fire hose. No longer constrained by any virtual limits, we're feeling the effects of this flood of digital assets." 
It's no longer about generating digital data--we have more than enough already. The challenge is now: How do we visualize the data, filter it, remix it, and access it in ways meaningful to us?
In many subtle and not-so-subtle ways we're seeing user experience and design returning to software. What developments in UI and HCI design promise to empower users rather than confuse and overwhelm them?" 
There are so many opportunities. Raise your hand if you've been feeling overwhelmed with the pressure to keep up. Nod knowingly if you've ever said or thought anything like:
"They released a new rev again? Oh. Great. I guess I know how I'm spending my next few weekends..."
"Is there NO FRICKIN' LIMIT to what they'll add to these APIs?"
"Don't you DARE throw out that stack of journals, magazine articles, web printouts, partly-read books, and blogs. I really am going to get to them."
"All I did was take a single wifi-free week's vacation, and now I have 19,343 emails and at least 600 posts in my RSS reader I have to catch up on..."
"Why oh why didn't I become a plumber? Not scalable, sure, but also not outsourceable.  And the domain knowledge is fairly stable... unlike my CS degree... [begins to laugh hysterically and inappropriately]".
"I realize this product went through beta, but seriously, did they watch any real humans to try to use this interface?"
Yes, there are so many opportunities. Anyone who can help attentuate the firehose in some way is a hero to those who are drowning. 
And we can do it in so many different ways.
We can do it with "less is less" products (championed valiantly by the 37 Signals folks).
We can do it with better tutorials, reference materials, and learning experiences.
We can do it with better design.
We can do it with filters. Or maybe lenses.
Remember, this is not about how long it takes to truly become an expert. In fact, where there is real passion there is always continuous learning and challenges in whatever it is the person is passionate about whether it's conversational Klingon or digital video editing or snowboarding or meditation or being a wine snob/expert. This is not about dumbing down to give users a nice (albeit false) sense of self-esteem. This is about getting them to where they can actually do something.
Here are a few possibilities, but of course it depends greatly on the context of the tool (including expertise and expectations of the user):
1) Consider making different user profiles within the product itself, and allowing the user to choose a configuration for the interface that matches the user's goal and current level of skill and knowledge. Yes, that could mean having things like "advanced modes", and while that's a somewhat controversial usability practice, it definitely has a place, and can be done brilliantly for many (not all) products. But yes, it's about attenuating what a particular user is exposed to in the interface -- not hiding capabilities from them without their knowledge.

2) If you can't change the product, change the documentation. I've been working on and off on an intro to movie-making book to teach Final Cut Express and Final Cut Pro to mortals. The Final Cut interface is beyond overwhelming:
We could spend the first three chapters describing what each component of the interface is for. But that just keeps them in the suck zone longer, produces cognitive overload, and completely violates the "give them the minimum needed to start being creative."  In other words, trying to explain the Final Cut interface only delays their ability to start doing the cool thing--editing video!
But we can attenuate the interface by postponing the "here's what every single one of the 230 things in the interface does..." (and that's just the part of the interface you can see...) and instead focus their attention just on the six or less things they need to get in there and start editing video.


3) Use a spiral user experience model:

4) Create context-dependent FAQs and/or context-dependent "FDTs" (Frequently Done Things). At any given point in the use of a tool, what the user is most likely to do next is rarely random. By having some kind of reference or learning or embedded help that focuses on those can be a big help. Too many reference or training materials are organized by topic, when the user often has no idea what the topic IS. They want to do something, but they have no idea which part of the interface they're supposed to be looking up in the help file, because they don't know what comes next...
5) In training materials for the product, focus on getting the user doing something cool as early as possible! Don't bog them down with tons of theory before letting them apply what they've learned in some meaningful, interesting, and/or useful way. I've seen Java instructors make their students wait---forever before they students can actually write code, because the instructor believed they shouldn't be constructing code until they have a complete understanding.That's not how humans work, and no, this is not a matter of "learning preferences" either. There may be some people who believe they are more comfortable learning the theory first, but that doesn't make it better learning -- even for those who believe they prefer it. 
God knows that if we had to understand physics before we could ever start to walk... most of us would still not be walking.
6) Make sure there's a way for the user to know when they've crossed the thresholds. Sometimes the user is capable of doing more than they realize. Find a way to prove to them that they really can  kick ass (or at least that they no longer suck). This must not be faked! This must be real, and again--not some attempt to dumb it down to make the user feel good. It may be that the user is doing something meaningful, that applies directly to what they really want to do, but the materials/instructor/app haven't made it clear enough how this seemingly simple thing relates or bridges to something that matters.
So remember...The "time to stop sucking" and "time to first kick-ass" quotients are among the biggest advantages we have in a world where the competition is both fierce and plentiful. (And that's both market competition as well as competition for our scarce and precious brain/cognitive/attention bandwidth.) More importantly, it's a way in which we can make a positive impact on the lives of users.
And for more motivation, don't forget to read Information Anxiety.
Now where the hell did I put my GTD next action list...

One component worth considering:  Utility.
Notepad for Windows has a very passionate following, and nearly a vertical Kick Ass Curve.
Just Google "written in notepad"
I just did for the first time and found this: http://www.notepad.org/
Many authors brag their site was done in Windows notepad.
Does this mean Notepad kicks ass?
Well, maybe it does.  Maybe this makes your point more than anything, but if I were going to code a program, I would target a complexity a bit more than notepad.
Maybe this is where we are all going wrong.
Maybe this is were Apple hit the nail on the head with the iPod - you know how to use it before you even see it.
Still I think the iPod kicks more ass than Notepad :)
Come to think of it Notepad does seem to be more of a Apple product than a Microsoft product, and its the first thing I look at when they release a new operating system.

Great post. After all it's all about empowering users. 
I particularly like the "Remember, this is not about how long it takes to truly become an expert .. This is about getting them to where they can actually do something." With so many choices and distractions available out there, failing to keep user's engaged results in reduced product sales, website visits etc. So kudos for the Kick Ass Insight!Posted by: Owen Cutajar | Oct 27, 2005 2:20:38 AM
Information overload: yes. So I followed the link marked "lenses" on the basis that overloading a term like lens would be about improving clarity, focus, access to normally inaccessible information.  It led to something called squidoo which contained mock web pages, AFAICS. What is it about? Were it not mentioned here, I'd now dismiss it as pointless.
Posted by: hgs | Oct 27, 2005 3:59:36 AM
Shaded seems to be missing a vital component in assessing notepad. It's not the lack of complexity that makes it inadequate for programming, but that it can give no direction to the beginner. All the reward of Notepad is for the experienced user. To the beginner with no experience it gives nothing back. Notepad is already located towards the top end of the curve in their case, but for the new bod just stepping into say, web programming, Notepad is right down at the bottom.
The biggest problem I can see with "lenses" is that it's pretty irrelevent to the article and not signposted either here or on Seth Godin's site in a way that's easy to understand or even interestingly useful to the casual observer.
Anyway, Passionate Users is an inspiring read, in the main, and the theory is great. Some more tips on execution would be very welcome, a lot of this advice is very generically applicable but the internal resistance you can experience trying to get applications user-friendly makes creating a user experience rather difficult.

Just a tiny nit-pick here:
it's conversational Klingon with an l between the K and the i ;)And given the length of this article and that I can find only one thing to "nag" about and stand in awe of the rest is just phenomenal in this era of infromation overload.

hgs: This would have been a better link for the interesting "lenses" concept of Seth Godin http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/10/the_next_free_e.html
And a great post again Kathy!

 Remote work will break the US monopoly on global talent


                  Remote work will break the US monopoly on global talent
                  

November 8th, 2021
Remote work is creating a new economic niche, and countries that put in the work to fill it will finally be able to compete with the US to attract talent. This is the once-in-a-generation opportunity for small, stable countries to grow, diversify, and up-skill their economy.
The United States has been the #1 target destination for immigrants for generations. It has a mythical reputation as the place where anyone can go from rags to riches. It's been much more stable than many regions, and the American standard of living is much higher than the world average. However, the US makes it difficult to enter the country, preventing prospective immigrants from accessing these opportunities.Competition for talent follows a steep power law.
Even so, it's been hard to compete with the US for talent. Countries' ability to compete for immigrants has historically followed a steep power law. In a 2016 Gallup poll, 3.5x more prospective migrants wanted to move to the US than to Germany, the second-most desirable location.

Remote work has changed this equation dramatically. Accelerated by the pandemic, it's more possible than ever to attract highly skilled, highly paid residents and bring their high incomes and valuable know-how into your community. 

Small, stable countries in favorable timezones have a once-in-a-generation opportunity at their fingertips. Welcome these talented, energetic go-getters into your country, and you will rapidly stimulate your economy, up-skill the local population, and prepare your country for the future.

This proposition will be especially attractive to countries that are keen to:
Diversify the economy: Countries with concentrated economies (often around tourism) need to diversify their economies for long-term sustainability and antifragility. Welcoming immigrants to do remote knowledge work is a rapid way way to expand beyond their traditional economic base. (examples: Aruba, Croatia)Ride the wave of technological change: Some countries have realized that the world is changing and are aggressively embracing change to not get left behind. Welcoming high-skilled immigrants is one way to accelerate this transition. (examples: El Salvador, Singapore)Reverse a demographic spiral: Still other countries are seeing their populations shrink, as the demographic pyramid has more old people than young people. Immigrants of all types can help reverse this trend. (examples: Japan, Uruguay)
How has remote work opened up new opportunities?Remote work opens up new opportunities for what I call "immigration arbitrage". It's historically been difficult for most places to attract immigrants with lots of education and earning potential, because those immigrants generally sought cities like London or New York or San Francisco where they could plug into an economic powerhouse.

Remote work has changed this dynamic for many industries. Now, you don't need to be in San Francisco to be a highly productive programmer or in London to be a highly productive stock trader. Now, if you're in Mexico City, you can call in to your colleague sitting in a SF and you can make the same contributions as them, yet without having to actually physically be in the US. You're close enough that you can fly in for the quarterly team retreat or annual company conference, but you don't have to get an employment visa.

This opportunity is especially open to countries with ideal time zones, if they're willing to create a welcoming environment for people in their region or around the world to work with world class companies in the same time zone. For example, Vancouver has been an early mover on this opportunity. Tech companies based in San Francisco and Seattle have "innovation hubs" whose primary role is to create a place that talent that hasn't been able to get a visa to the US. We've also started to see this in places like Lagos and Buenos Aires. Nigerian developers can work alongside startups in Berlin and London, while Argentinian developers work as consultants for companies based in the US. We're going to be seeing a lot more of this now that remote work is more widely accepted by companies worldwide. 

This also gives these cities a better chance of becoming knowledge economy powerhouses in their own right. Before, they had a cold start problem—these places lacked the critical mass of key talent, so those who did have the skills and motivation would leave for greener pastures. Now, they can compete to initially bring people to their city on dimensions other than economic network effects (e.g. climate, quality of life, regulatory arbitrage, safety), and then once you have a critical mass of people, it starts a flywheel to develop an ecosystem of its own, rather than just a "little brother" of an existing hub. 

This strategy is defensibleIt's difficult for the largest, richest countries to copy this strategy, because:
Immigration is politically unpopular in places like the US, France, Japan, and UK. Compared to countries that haven't received much immigration in the past, it is unlikely for these economic juggernauts to dramatically change direction and put out the welcome mat, even to highly skilled immigrants. In addition, these countries have giant populations, so even with the political will to welcome immigrants, the bureaucracy is likely to act more slowly than smaller, more nimble countries.Large countries also have less to gain on a percentage basis. If 10,000 highly skilled Hong Kongers move to the US (population 330 million), it will show up as a small blip on the overall GDP of the country. If that same group moves to The Caymans (population 65 thousand), growth would skyrocket.
This is great news for smaller, less wealthy countries, because it gives them a defensible advantage against the incumbents.

Which countries are well-positioned for this opportunity?Here are some characteristics that make a country especially well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. They're not all necessary for success—I can't think of any countries meet all of these criteria anyways—but the more the country has, the more likely it will be competitive at attracting immigrants:Small and nimbleGood climate, natural beautyTimezone that matches some of the world's biggest economiesShort flight to the world's biggest economiesShort flights to immigrants' home countriesEnglish-speakingPolitical and monetary stabilityOpenness to change/innovation – e.g. regulatory arbitrage as a bonusLow cost of livingGood educational opportunities 
Here are some countries that meet many of these criteria. Which countries would you add to the list?Uruguay – Island of stability in a sea of instability in Latin America. Nestled between Argentina and Brazil (two countries with growing social unrest and, in Argentina's case, high inflation). Good timezone to collaborate with both the US and Europe. I'd expect Uruguay to be especially interested in this strategy, given attracting immigrants is one of the current president's top priorities.Canada – Stable, high quality of living, good educational system including world-class universities, close to the US, English-speaking, welcomes immigrants, access to great amenities like restaurants, already has a strong base of knowledge workers.Croatia – Beautiful, in the EU but lower cost of living than other EU members, one of the safest countries in the world, short flight to centers of commerce like London and Paris and Berlin.Singapore – English-speaking, physical safety. This city state has long been a place for highly educated, high net worth people from around the region to move to escape political instability and high taxes. Caribbean islands – Proximity to the US, beautiful climate, relative safety. The native language for many of these island nations is English, "the language of commerce".Panama – Stable and safe relative to its neighbors. Could be attractive for people in the Central American region to move there and still be close to home. I could also imagine people from South America moving there, since they have a shared language and it's closer to the US than Uruguay. The US dollar is widely used in Panama. Also, Panama has world famous beaches and surfing, which are very attractive to a certain subset of knowledge workers. Costa Rica – Similar story to Panama, with the addition that it also has a thriving biotech manufacturing sector. Immigrant groups to cater toThe following groups have lots of people who are highly educated and have a lot of potential to contribute to the knowledge economy, yet have growing reasons to leave their home. A smart country would do well to attract these high-potential people and make it as easy as possible to put down roots:Cubans – Stuck in a Communist regime, surplus of doctors (and so many other countries have a shortage of doctors!)Hong Kongers – Fleeing the growing influence of the Chinese government in Hong Kong; in some cases they are coordinating immigration as a group, which brings additional opportunities for becoming the place for Hong Kongers to end up. (The Taiwanese may be in a similar position soon.)Argentinians – Recession, high inflation, low social trust, high taxes, high crimeBrazilians – Recession, political instability, extremely high crimeVenezuelans – Hyperinflation, physical danger, repressive governmentLebanon – Sectarian conflict, economic meltdownNigeria – Growing political instability, high poverty, poor infrastructure
Which groups would you add to this list? Let me know!

Obstacles & problems to solveHere's an incomplete list of challenges that will make this shift more difficult. I believe they are all surmountable, but important to take into account. Let me know what you'd add to this list!Labor laws – It's complex to follow labor laws in lots of different countries, though companies like Remote.com are making this easier over time.Foreign exchange & capital controls – Foreign exchange is complicated, expensive, and at times risky. In addition, some countries' governments make it very difficult to move money in and out of the country.Language barriers – It is challenging for teams to work together when there are large language differences between team members. Cultural differences – The business culture in San Francisco is very different from the business culture in Buenos Aires, for example, and as a result people may work less productively with each other at first because misunderstandings may be more common than people who were educated in the same business culture.Time zones – Distant timezones can make collaborations very difficult, and even small timezone differences can result in additional overhead to keep everyone in the loop. This gets especially tricky in the spring/autumn when clocks around the world change at different times (or not at all) for Daylight Savings.Trust building – Most people I speak to say that it's harder to build trust over video chat vs in-person, and I have to say I agree (though it's not impossible!).Pay equality – It's not generally agreed upon whether people doing the same job in different places should get paid the same amount or if their pay should be adjusted according to their local cost of living. I've seen this create a lot of tension on teams.
Rather than being discouraged by these challenges, I'm excited. There are so many businesses to be built, and so many opportunities for governments to create value! If you're working on a solution, let me know!

~ ~ ~

As an American, I'm sad the US is frittering away its enviable position as the world's most desirable immigration destination. But if we're not going to use this opportunity to power the American engine of economic growth, I'm at least happy that the world is changing to enable other countries to take on this mantle.

When a trillion dollar bill is lying on the ground, the important thing is that somebody picks it up, even if it's not us.#government

                  Consistency is key: A letter to the Stanford GSC
                  

April 21st, 2014
Richard Dawkins is very clear on his opinion of creationism and its supporters. In an article published by The Guardian, he stated, "Any science teacher who denies that the world is billions ... of years old is teaching children a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood." He continues, "Ignorant, closed-minded, false teachers who stand in their way come as close as I can reckon to committing true sacrilege."

Student group Atheists, Humanists, and Agnostics (AHA!) invited Dawkins to speak at Stanford during the fall quarter about his autobiography, An Appetite for Wonder. The event was sponsored by the Graduate Student Council (GSC) as well as the ASSU Undergraduate Senate, Stanford Speakers Bureau, and the Secular Student Alliance.

Towards the end of winter quarter, the Stanford Anscombe Society (SAS) requested similar funding from the GSC for an April 5th event titled "Communicating Values". The aim of the conference was to "help university students and young adults promote the values of marriage, family, and sexual integrity to the broader popular culture".

The event’s speaker list, which included several prominent opponents of same-sex marriage, was condemned on the grounds that it was discriminatory and "unwelcoming" by several members of GradQ, Stanford’s umbrella group for LGBT and allied students in the graduate and professional schools. "The [SAS] website says that the conference is to train participants how to make secular arguments on why not to have gay marriage in the US. This event will hurt LGBT members at Stanford and provide an unsafe space for them," said GradQ member Brianne Huntsman in a March GSC meeting.

In light of GradQ’s concerns, GSC rejected SAS’s request for $600 in honoraria funds for event speakers in a 10-2 vote. GSC officer Eduardo González-Maldonado stated that the student council’s funding guidelines explicitly prohibited provision of funds to "any event that makes anyone feel unwelcome and uncomfortable".

Unfortunately, the GSC has been inconsistent in upholding this guideline. While the Anscombe event was ineligible for funds due to hosting speakers who are discriminatory towards the LGBT community, AHA! was able to receive support from the GSC to host Dawkins, who is famous for saying that those who do not believe in evolution are "ignorant, stupid, insane, or wicked". The ideas he represents are similarly negative towards the religious community.

While I agree with Dawkins and personally find the views of the SAS conference speakers detestable, I am very disappointed in the GSC’s inconsistency in its dealing of these two situations. If the GSC were truly committed to its official guideline to not fund events that "create an environment where a given segment of the graduate student population are made to feel unwelcome at the event due to religious, political, or other conviction", it would have rejected AHA!’s request in the fall.

As an educational institution, Stanford has an obligation to foster and protect intellectual discussion. It is inexcusable that certain more popular opinions that are derogatory towards a group may be freely voiced while individuals with less favored views are silenced.

I urge the GSC to remove this guideline entirely. Even if the organization were devoted to consistently upholding its policy of not funding any events where students are "made to feel unwelcome", it would have an extremely stifling effect on intellectual discussion at Stanford. It is nearly impossible to express and develop an innovative idea without offending someone along the way. Challengers to the status quo, including those who hold ridiculous or even offensive ideas, push us to consider issues from different perspectives and reflect upon our ideas more deeply. Their inclusion is crucial to maintaining a vigorous intellectual environment, and I hope the GSC takes that into account in the future as it works to build a better campus for the Stanford community.

 City review: A day in Jakarta


                  City review: A day in Jakarta
                  

May 21st, 2018
I spent Thursday, 8 March 2018 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Of the cities I visited during this trip, Jakarta was the one I disliked most. I try to be as positive as possible on the internet (it's just too easy to be negative), but in this case it would be ingenious. The parts of Jakarta I explored were unpleasant and a bit depressing.

If Las Vegas and Mad Max had a baby...

The main thoroughfare felt more like a highway than a street. This combined with the big, blocky commercial developments gave it a strong Vegas vibe, though maybe a few decades after humanity has bounced back from a minor nuclear war. Something between Las Vegas and Mad Max, but with far less space.

I would have liked to spend more time getting lost in the neighborhoods. I suspect they would’ve felt very different. I tried to wander over to the more winding streets of the city off the main thoroughfare, but it was so difficult to cross the reckless, never-ending traffic that I didn't get very far.

I was also leered at everywhere I went, which did not add to my sense of safety. Upon returning to SF from the trip, I mentioned to a colleague that I'd wandered Jakarta alone for a day, and she looked horrified. She said that was a really bad idea, that kidnappings of foreigners are common and that the general crime rate is just really high. I had no mishaps, so in a way I'm glad I heard this after a chance to see the city firsthand. But in the branching timelines of the multiverse at least a few infinities of Devons did not fare so well. 

Everything about the city felt temporary. It felt like it was either in the process of being built or—more often—of being demolished. Construction was everywhere, and it made no effort to contain its externalities. The sidewalks were covered in rubble. In Beijing, the construction was an annoyance, but it felt optimistic and hopeful. Here it felt like a "fuck you" to the residents. (I imagine many Beijingers also feel that way, but here it was more in your face.) Certain parts of Jakarta felt like there’d been a bombing raid of a once-glorious city, especially the areas with pretty whitewashed colonial architecture.Rubble everywhere

Public toilets were Port-A-Potties

Another thing that put me on edge is that high-end establishments (hotels, fancy malls, banks) all had metal detectors at the pedestrian entrance. In the single day I was there I went through several checkpoints around the city where they did random open-door car searches, and I only took a handful of car rides. According to a local I asked, these were relatively new, a response to the 2017 bombings. Another mentioned the 2003 terrorist attacks. These safety precautions felt performative though, as though the security folks were just going through the motions. I doubt they would serve as much of a deterrent to a motivated terrorist. 

The cost of this performance seems surprisingly high. I don't so much mean the direct financial cost—the labor to man it is cheap in Indonesia—but it seems like it would deter international businesspeople, whom Indonesia is clearly trying to attract. It makes me question if the government/police really have things under control, and it makes me worry about the general trust level of society. The costs and benefits don’t seem to add up, but maybe it’s just a matter of local vs global incentives. The individual hotel owner wants to look like they care about their customers’ safety. They of course would like people to feel like Jakarta is a safe place to do business that doesn’t require metal detectors, but as long as that’s not true they benefit more from having the protection signal than they’re hurt by it contributing to the overall feeling of instability.
Pedestrians not welcome

The pedestrian experience was just so odd. It felt like older parts of the city had originally developed around good sidewalks, strong street life, but then someone decided to block off that access. There were many places where there was a nice path, but it was cut off by a makeshift obstacle that kept me from getting where I wanted to go. 

I had a general sense of "if you can’t afford to arrive here by car, you’re not the kind of customer we’re looking for". There were a many spots where the underlying street structure was amenable to pedestrians, but then small changes after the initial development were made to actively inconvenience pedestrians. Terrible pedestrian experience! Wandering Jakarta was the most exhausting and unwelcoming of the five cities, and that's saying quite a lot considering Beijing was in that mix.The sidewalks were kind of cool. In a bunch of places you can look through the cracks to see the sewer underneath. (Photo below!) I have a few guesses as to why they went with this design, though if you have better information please let me know!It rains a lot in Indonesia, so the gaps probably aid drainage rather than putting lots of load on a single opening. (God knows we have this problem in San Francisco despite receiving just a fraction of Jakarta's rainfall.)I suspect it's cheaper to just put slabs down without carefully sealing them. The downside here is it's a little tricker to walk on.Maintenance and replacement is probably easier. If a piece is damaged, they can just lift it out and replace it. On the other hand they're probably more prone to damage, too.

Incessant construction — exciting and optimistic, but extremely unpleasant

Lots of stray cats!

Domination of the street was roughly split between cars and motorbikes.

I want to underscore just how difficult it was to cross the street. I'd just been to Ho Chi Minh City two days earlier, which is infamous for traffic that's difficult to traverse by foreigners, and that was a piece of cake compared to this. At least in HCMC there was some pedestrian infrastructure, but in Jakarta it felt like pedestrians were not just an afterthought; they weren't a priority at all. Many sections of the city had no sidewalk at all, and let's just say that wasn't because the streets themselves were welcoming to foot traffic. I have a distinct memory of crossing a small channel on what looked like a footbridge from my map, but when I arrived there were cars and motorcycles speeding through the intersection, and there was no sidewalk. Construction was blocking the way, which made the flow of traffic even more erratic. (For context, I was going from the intersection on the left across towards the right.) What was worse was that I couldn't easily get to a different route. My Uber had dropped me off there, and each direction I could possibly go was totally hostile to pedestrians. So I had no choice but to cross this bridge seething with high-speed traffic. This short story from the Atlantic about getting lost in Jakarta (about halfway down this article) is right on with my own experience of the city.

I wanted to take a Grab or Uber Moto to get the full Jakarta experience, since they're clearly a primary mode of transport for residents, but I was so exhausted from the harrowing experience of navigating the streets by foot that I decided I just didn't want the stress. I still slightly regret this decision, but at least I'll know my mom would have been pleased with my taking the more conservative decision for once.
..
Density is not a silver bullet

Since coming across this image of Jakarta's spatial distribution of density last year, I was excited to experience it firsthand:
In the US, I generally think of density as closely correlated with interestingness, community, and a feeling of safety in an "eyes on the street" Jacobsian way. The experience wandering around Jakarta disabused me of any notion I might've had that this might be a simple casual effect. 

It's intriguing to compare Jakarta to Saigon and Bangalore, both of which are far poorer than Jakarta. The people I interacted with on the street seemed much less cosmopolitan and educated than these two cities, the wealth disparities seemed much more in-your-face and intentional, and it felt like everyone was just trying to create their own little sanctuary out of the hustle and bustle rather than creating inclusionary public spaces. Labor—and life—felt really cheap. One of my big open questions is why that’s the case, especially since wealth is not a good enough explanation.
..
Baby's first BRT 🚌

The highlight of my day was taking TransJakarta, the city's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. It my first BRT ever, and it was even better than I'd imagined. It was also the most functional system I saw in the city. Jakarta doesn't have a subway (yet), so TransJakarta is the primary mode of mass transit in the city. I'd always been a bit skeptical of the claims that BRT could function at a level of service competitive with rail, but I was really impressed. Everything about the experience felt just like using a train, just with squishier suspension. My first trip of the day was in a car, and we were ensnarled by the traffic, but on the way back I took the priority buses. This 30 minute TransJakarta trip was only $0.25 (Rp3.500) and it got me to my destination in about half the time the equivalent Uber would’ve taken. The people watching was far better, too.
Cool underground bus station 😀


Loosely held norm to have separate sides for men and women 


The BRT stations looked more like ferry docks than what I usually imagine as bus stops


Getting out of the stations, which were in the middle of the road, was a bit of a labyrinth.


Love zooming past the rest of the traffic 🚍✊

Cheap labor => doorman for the bus!..
..
Food

Again I don't think of myself as a picky eater, but I didn't particularly enjoy the food in Jakarta. It was worth trying though! I'll mostly leave you with pictures here:Spicer than I expected 😳 The next thing I (promptly) consumed was about a gallon of whole milk.

Fried spagetti instead of a free bread basket! I'd never seen that before.

This curried lamb was different from most curries I've had. Can't say I'd seek it out in the future, but probably the tastiest traditional food I had in Jakarta.
Ostensibly chicken, but it was so fried and coated with sugary sauce that I could barely taste the meat. Not my thing, and definitely not nutritious.


Hard to see from the photo, but this was a pile of what felt like super dry and hard beef jerky. It was the most highly recommended dish. I didn't really like it, but it was interesting.
At the end of the day, I worked from a hip coffee shop called One Fifteenth for a few hours and almost forgot that I wasn’t in San Francisco. The guy to my left was on a call with Excel pulled up on his laptop screen, and the two women to my right were studying physics. Strange how certain kinds of establishments can be found in every city around the world. They even have an Instagram! So hip.One Fifteenth Coffee was in this charming, low-slung building.

The value of a single Indonesian rupiah is so low that almost every transaction is in the thousands, so the ATM machine has a convenient double zero button to speed up entering in values.Uh oh, it looks like your embed code is broken.There was one public space I enjoyed quite a bit: the big square in the "old town", encircled by Cafe Batavia on one side and the Jakarta History Museum on the other. It was lively and full of all sorts of people. A group of young girls approached me and asked if I could practice English with them. I of course said yes, and they proceeded to pelter me with questions. As soon as the first girl finished, the next girl picked up right after her and to my surprise asked exactly the same questions. This happened with two other girls, and they asked me to take a picture with them. They were very good at English! And very assertive.
I got really good at answering these questions after four opportunities to practice!

Cafe Batavia was a cool sanctuary to escape the heat and get some work done


To be clear, disliking Jakarta is different from being unhappy to have experienced it. I had few priors on Indonesia beforehand, so I certainly can’t complain to have had an opportunity to build intuitions about the capital of the biggest Muslim country. 🙂

 Israel's water miracle


                  Israel's water miracle
                  

July 1st, 2023
The saga of Israeli water management is one of the most inspiring stories of the last 75 years. Israel went from having a serious water problem to being a net water exporter to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, the population grew from ~1 million to well over 9 million.
With its land mass 60% desert, the region was originally thought to support a max population of just 2 million people. But with tireless work, financial support to find new solutions, and brilliant technological advances, Israel was able to blow past those limits.

There was no one silver bullet. Israel's water crisis was averted through a portfolio approach. The country invested in a wide range of solutions of varying cost, timelines, and chance of success. Here are a few breakthroughs that were especially powerful:
Drip irrigation: Israeli engineers invented drip irrigation in the 1960s, replacing traditional flood irrigation. This method saves up to 90% of the water and boosts yields 10-90% (depending on crop type), because it controls water application to match the exact needs of each plant, and it reduces nutrient runoff compared to flood irrigation.
Desalination: Israel played a huge role in proving that desalination can be economically viable. The country desalinates 75% of its drinking water from the Mediterranean, and it has built some of the largest and most advanced desalination plants in the world.
Wastewater reuse: Recycled wastewater is a large and growing source of water in Israel, accounting for >25% of the country's water supply. They reuse 90% of their sewage for agricultural irrigation; for comparison, the US reuses <10%.
Improved crop varieties: Israeli agricultural scientists have developed new crop varieties that are more resistant to heat, drought, and saline conditions.
Real pricing: Most countries subsidize water. For a long time, Israel was no exception. But in 2009, they started charging people for the real price of the water they consumed. Without rationing or limiting supply, real pricing induced households to cut water use by 16%!

If you're interested to learn more, and if you want a spark of hope and a reminder that humans can solve hard problems, I highly recommend reading Let There Be Water: Israel's Solution for a Water-Starved World by Seth Siegel. It put me in such a good mood and was full of interesting technical details too!

 Productivity is like a heat engine

                  Productivity is like a heat engine
                  

August 28th, 2018
When I started learning about thermodynamics, I was shocked to learn that the typical engine converts only about 35% of its energy into useful work. Just the theoretical maximum efficiency for a typical car is ~73%*—converting all of its input heat into work would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. And in practice engines operate at an actual efficiency that is much lower once you take into friction, inefficient combustion, heat loss, and drag.When I first started working full-time, I was similarly shocked by how low my own work efficiency seemed to be. The majority of my output happened in a tiny portion of my overall hours, despite my sincere desire to be as productive as possible throughout the entire day. I felt a lot of guilt around this fact and would work late into the evenings to make up for my "wasted" time in the office. My impression was that a productive engineer was someone who churned out high quality code at a constant rate. My self-imposed standard was that from the moment I walk into work until the moment I pause for lunch and again when I leave at night, I should be making steady, unrelenting progress, and any gap in focus or deviation from the ideal path to a solution was bad performance.

As I settled in to the job, I saw that even my most effective coworkers did not match that pattern at all. They did achieve deep focus, but only after a period of settling in; as a result they emphasized having long chunks of hours to focus on a task, painfully aware of the tremendous costs to context switching. They could be sidetracked by an interesting conversation at the coffee machine just like anyone else, and everyone had days where they were just plain tired or distracted. Of course the most productive folks minimized these disruptions, but they still experienced them. Humans require time to boot up, and we don't always do what we're told—even when we want to, and even when we're the ones telling ourselves!

When these particularly effective engineers were fully focused, they still spent some time going down paths that proved to be dead ends. Some of the features they built ended up being entirely redefined by some product decision made farther up the pipeline, rendering useless all of the focused work that went into their implementation. Sometimes halfway through some task they came up with a far better approach or discovered that some other engineer had already implemented something that would solve their problem, in effect making the previous work useless. Again, all of these inefficiencies are things to minimize, but they can't be done away with entirely. Ambiguity is at the core of a lot of work, especially in software, so some amount of inefficiency is irreducible.

Finally, even a perfectly focused, visionary engineer has to sleep and eat. Most people sustainably work about a third of the day, and beyond that they start to burn out. On a tight deadline other priorities can go on the back burner, but still sleep can only be sacrificed only so much. The most I've ever worked for a continuous period of is about 16h/day, leaving 8h for sleeping, eating, and getting some fresh air, and by the end of that month I was running on empty. Maybe other folks can do that for a longer period of time, but I find it hard to imagine there isn't some limit.

It's not possible to be 100% efficient while working towards your goals. This is obvious in retrospect. Natural limits (like your need for sleep or the fact that the world is complex and constantly shifting what it even means to reach your goal) cap your theoretical maximum, and little tactical errors (like not having quite enough coffee one morning or breaking up your day with meetings) mean that we all operate at an actual efficiency that is much lower. We can make better decisions to minimize the friction caused by this second category of mistakes, but we can't eliminate them entirely.

Just like a heat engine, there's a theoretical limit far below 100% to how much we can squeeze out of a day, and realities of daily life make our actual output even lower than that. You can always strive to improve your processes to remove silly mistakes, transition costs, and other types of friction, but don't beat yourself up if you aren't perfectly efficient—it's not attainable in the first place!

NotesI talk mostly about thermal efficiency above, but the effective power of an engine once they power reaches the wheels is even lower. Taib Iskandar Mohamad wrote on Research Gate, "The above-mentioned efficiency [is] basically measure[d] from tank to crankshaft (thermal efficiency). In reality, there are more lost along the way; in flywheel, transmission, axle etc before power reaches the wheels. So effectively, the tank-to-wheel efficiency is in the order of about 10% or much less. The number may have improved over the years with the advancement of tribology, lighter chassis, improved engines and fuels etc."How did I arrive at the 73% number mentioned in the first paragraph? Here's the calculation, borrowed from Wikipedia:

April 30th, 2020


I'm starting a new podcast called Order Without Design with the most interesting couple I know: Alain & Marie-Agnes Bertaud.

This project is an extension of their book, Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities. With its focus on economic theory, you might not realize that this book is the product of the adventurous life these two have shared together. This podcast series is my excuse to hear and share those stories.

Join the three of us on a journey to the Bertauds' past lives in Bangkok, NYC, San Salvador, Algiers, and beyond! We'll explore the incredible stories that informed the theories in the book.

We'll be publishing the first few episodes in the coming weeks. Subscribe to this feed now to get the first full episode delivered straight to your queue. 

Chat soon 👋

 Teach a girl to fish


                  Teach a girl to fish
                  

February 5th, 2018
My favorite aphorism might be "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime". It's a useful idea to incorporate into your life philosophy, both for yourself and others. It's nice to offer help to someone with a problem that you can solve, but far better to teach them how to do it.* On the flip side, when there's something you don't know how to do, I encourage you to find someone who will both help you solve the problem and teach you how to solve it for yourself in the future.

This is especially important and undervalued for women and girls. Guys often go out of their way to help women solve problems. This is a nice gesture—who doesn't like it when someone offers to change your tire for you or build that flat box IKEA shelf?—but over time it's pernicious. In the long run, it can breed helplessness. Women tend to have a lot of little annoyances resolved for them, and by not having to find solutions to these problems themselves they don’t get to exercise that muscle.

There are lots of micro challenges in day-to-day life that, when overcome, build confidence that you can solve problems. They also build intuition for how to think about how to approach problems. Each individual experience doesn't give critical insight into future problems that one might come across, but over time they build instincts that are important. I suspect this plays a role in the relative scarcity in numbers of women in engineering. (Are you aware of any research on this subject? I’m speaking from anecdotal expereince and deduction here and would love to learn more on the topic.)Imagine a group of friends is setting up a movie on a projector, and there's some trouble getting it to work. Who gets up to fix it? In my experience, it's almost always a guy in the group, even if the women are capable of solving the problem. I don’t mean to say that this is sexist—the guy is doing a nice favor, and if anything it's a sign of respect so the others don't have to get up. However, this is a prime opportunity to build up experiences tackling problems. When someone gets up to fix the projector and realizes that it’s just the input source (and it’s always just the input source…), that person will feel that much more confident that they’ll be able to get to the bottom of the issue next time that (s)he runs into a problem. Plus, it may help the person to start building a mental model of the user interface or electronics, which they can then bring to the next technical problem they run into. Note that this is on the girls as much as the guys. It's totally within their power to offer to fix it! 

What I like about this mindset is that it's optimistic and actionable, for both women and people who want to support them. For women, when you run into a problem that you don't know how to solve, first try to figure it out yourself. You're likely to receive help when you ask for it, but don't let that tempt you! Try to push through on your own as long as possible. And if you do need help, which all of us do at some point, don't let the person just resolve the problem—ask them how it's done.

Feminist allies are always asking about ways they can help, and it makes me sad that most of the suggestions they get are useless, costly, condescending, or just come from a bitter place. "Teach a girl to fish" is none of these things:
It's helpful, in that the woman will walk away with real skills and confidence afterwards It doesn't take much more time than just doing the thing yourself, and it might even save time down the road because now she can solve it herselfIt's empowering to the person you've taught, whereas some suggested solutions to gender imbalances condescendingly make it artificially easier for her (which has a host of other consequences that I won't get into here…)The suggestion doesn't imply that you're a bad or sexist person, just that a small behavior change could be helpful

It's also fun to teach people, and it can help you get better at the thing yourself! It's a win-win.

Note: We should teach men to fish, too. But we tend to do that more often anyways, so that's not the focus on this post. :)* Obviously this is not a pure rule to apply across your entire life. If your taxes are really complicated, it probably isn't worth it to spend months working through the tax code to understand every nook and cranny of what you owe. If you've been charged with a crime, you should probably not try to defend yourself in court but instead get a defense lawyer. Heck, it might even make sense to buy pre-chopped vegetables if you have a tendency to cut yourself by accident when cooking with sharp knives. (Not that I’m speaking from experience or anything…) Specialization is real and valuable, and I don't mean to undercut that. My point is that we should not create a mindset of helplessness in ourselves, but rather build confidence that we can figure things out if we have to. This does not mean you have to reinvent the wheel.#tools-for-thought

December 27th, 2018

Subcultures are dead. I plan to write a full obituary soon.
Subcultures were the main creative cultural force from roughly 1975 to 2000, when they stopped working. Why?
One reason—among several—is that as soon as subcultures start getting really interesting, they get invaded by muggles, who ruin them. Subcultures have a predictable lifecycle, in which popularity causes death. Eventually—around 2000—everyone understood this, and gave up hoping some subculture could somehow escape this dynamic.
(You can read very brief previews of my analysis of subculture dynamics in this table and/or this page.)
The muggles who invade and ruin subcultures come in two distinct flavors, mops and sociopaths, playing very different roles. This insight was influenced by Venkatesh Rao’s Gervais Principle, an analysis of workplace dynamics. Rao’s theory is hideous, insightful nihilism; I recommend it.1The birth of coolBefore there is a subculture, there is a scene. A scene is a small group of creators who invent an exciting New Thing—a musical genre, a religious sect, a film animation technique, a political theory. Riffing off each other, they produce examples and variants, and share them for mutual enjoyment, generating positive energy.
The new scene draws fanatics. Fanatics don’t create, but they contribute energy (time, money, adulation, organization, analysis) to support the creators.
Creators and fanatics are both geeks.2 They totally love the New Thing, they’re fascinated with all its esoteric ins and outs, and they spend all available time either doing it or talking about it. 
If the scene is sufficiently geeky, it remains a strictly geek thing; a weird hobby, not a subculture.
If the scene is unusually exciting, and the New Thing can be appreciated without having to get utterly geeky about details, it draws mops.3 Mops are fans, but not rabid fans like the fanatics. They show up to have a good time, and contribute as little as they reasonably can in exchange.
Geeks welcome mops, at first at least. It’s the mass of mops who turn a scene into a subculture. Creation is always at least partly an act of generosity; creators want as many people to use and enjoy their creations as possible. It’s also good for the ego; it confirms that the New Thing really is exciting, and not just a geek obsession. Further, some money can usually be extracted from mops—just enough, at this stage, that some creators can quit their day jobs and go pro. (Fanatics contribute much more per head than mops, but there are few enough that it’s rarely possible for creatives to go full time with support only from fanatics.) Full-time creators produce more and better of the New Thing.The mop invasionFanatics want to share their obsession, and mops initially validate it for them too. However, as mop numbers grow, they become a headache. Fanatics do all the organizational work, initially just on behalf of geeks: out of generosity, and to enjoy a geeky subsociety. They put on events, build websites, tape up publicity fliers, and deal with accountants. Mops just passively soak up the good stuff.4 You may even have to push them around the floor; they have to be led to the drink. At best you can charge them admission or a subscription fee, but they’ll inevitably argue that this is wrong because capitalism is evil, and also because they forgot their wallet.
Mops also dilute the culture. The New Thing, although attractive, is more intense and weird and complicated than mops would prefer. Their favorite songs are the ones that are least the New Thing, and more like other, popular things. Some creators oblige with less radical, friendlier, simpler creations.
Mops relate to each other in "normal" ways, like people do on TV, which the fanatics find repellent. During intermission, geeks want to talk about the New Thing, but mops blather about sportsball and celebrities. Also, the mops also seem increasingly entitled, treating the fanatics as service workers.
Fanatics may be generous, but they signed up to support geeks, not mops. At this point, they may all quit, and the subculture collapses.The sociopath invasionUnless sociopaths5 show up. A subculture at this stage is ripe for exploitation. The creators generate cultural capital, i.e. cool. The fanatics generate social capital: a network of relationships—strong ones among the geeks, and weaker but numerous ones with mops. The mops, when properly squeezed, produce liquid capital, i.e. money. None of those groups have any clue about how to extract and manipulate any of those forms of capital.
The sociopaths quickly become best friends with selected creators. They dress just like the creators—only better. They talk just like the creators—only smoother. They may even do some creating—competently, if not creatively. Geeks may not be completely fooled, but they also are clueless about what the sociopaths are up to.
Mops are fooled. They don’t care so much about details, and the sociopaths look to them like creators, only better. Sociopaths become the coolest kids in the room, demoting the creators. At this stage, they take their pick of the best-looking mops to sleep with. They’ve extracted the cultural capital.
The sociopaths also work out how to monetize mops—which the fanatics were never good at. With better publicity materials, the addition of a light show, and new, more crowd-friendly product, admission fees go up tenfold, and mops are willing to pay. Somehow, not much of the money goes to creators. However, more of them do get enough to go full-time, which means there’s more product to sell.
The sociopaths also hire some of the fanatics as actual service workers. They resent it, but at least they too get to work full-time on the New Thing, which they still love, even in the Lite version. The rest of the fanatics get pushed out, or leave in disgust, broken-hearted.The death of cool—unless…After a couple years, the cool is all used up: partly because the New Thing is no longer new, and partly because it was diluted into New Lite, which is inherently uncool. As the mops dwindle, the sociopaths loot whatever value is left, and move on to the next exploit. They leave behind only wreckage: devastated geeks who still have no idea what happened to their wonderful New Thing and the wonderful friendships they formed around it. (Often the geeks all end up hating each other, due first to the stress of supporting mops, and later due to sociopath divide-and-conquer manipulation tactics.)
Unless some of the creators are geniuses. If they can give the New Thing genuine mass appeal, they can ascend into superstardom. The subculture will reorganize around them, into a much more durable form. I won’t go into that in this blog post. I will point out that this almost never happens without sociopaths. An ambitious creator may know they have mass-appeal genius, and could be a star, but very rarely do they know how to get from here to there.ResistanceSo what is to be done?
This is a geek question. The subculture lifecycle is a problem only from a geek perspective. As far as mops are concerned, it provides reliable, low-cost waves of novelty entertainment and casual social relationships. As far as psychopaths are concerned, it generates easily-exploited pools of prestige, sex, power, and money.
From a utilitarian point of view, mops hugely outnumber geeks, so in terms of total social value, it’s all good. Can’t make omelettes without breaking some eggheads.
So what is to be done?
Geeks can refuse to admit mops. In fact, successful subcultures always do create costly barriers to entry, to keep out the uncommitted.6 In the heyday of subcultures, those were called poseurs.7 Mop exclusion keeps the subculture comfortable for geeks, but severely limits its potential. Often there’s a struggle between geeks who like their cozy little club as it is, and geeks who want a shot at greatness—for themselves, or the group, or the New Thing. In any case, subculture boundaries are always porous, and if the New Thing is cool enough, mops will get in regardless.
The optimal mop:geek ratio is maybe 6:1. At that ratio, the mops provide more energy than they consume. A ratio above about 10:1 becomes unworkable; it’s a recipe for burnout among supporting fanatics. Ideally, the ratio could be controlled. I think few subcultures understand this imperative, and I’m not sure how it could be done even if one did understand. Mops move in herds. Usually either there are only a few, or their numbers quickly grow too large.
Sociopaths only show up if there’s enough mops to exploit, so excluding (or limiting) mops is a strategy for excluding sociopaths. Some subcultures do understand this, and succeed with it.
Alternatively, you could recognize sociopaths and eject them. Geeks may be pretty good at the recognizing, but are lousy at the ejecting. Mops don’t recognize sociopaths, and anyway don’t care. Mops have little investment in the subculture, and can just walk away when sociopaths ruin it. By the time sociopaths show up, mops are numerically most of the subculture. Sociopaths manipulate the mops, and it’s hard for the geeks to overrule an overwhelming majority.
Anyway, horribly, geeks need sociopaths—if the New Thing is ever going to be more than a geeky hobby, or a brief fad that collapses under the weight of the mop invasion.
So what is to be done?Be slightly evilThe subcultural mode mostly ended around 2000. There still are subcultures, new ones all the time, but they no longer have the cultural and social force they used to. The "classical model" of subcultures no longer works, for the reasons given here, plus others I’ll describe in upcoming writing. I don’t think it can be rescued.
However, the fluid mode—my hoped-for future—resembles the subcultural mode in many ways. The same social dynamics may play out, unless there is a powerful antidote.
A slogan of Rao’s may point the way: Be slightly evil. Or: geeks need to learn and use some of the sociopaths’ tricks. Then geeks can capture more of the value they create (and get better at ejecting true sociopaths).
Specific strategies for sociopathy are outside the scope of this book. However, I have an abstract suggestion.
Rao concludes his analysis by explaining that his "sociopaths" are actually nihilists, in much the same sense as I use the word. Serious subcultures are usually eternalistic: the New Thing is a source of meaning that gives everything in life purpose. Eternalistic naïveté makes subcultures much easier to exploit.
"Slightly evil" defense of a subculture requires realism: letting go of eternalist hope and faith in imaginary guarantees that the New Thing will triumph. Such realism is characteristic of nihilism. Nihilism has its own delusions, though. It is worth trying to create beautiful, useful New Things—and worth defending them against nihilism. A fully realistic worldview corrects both eternalistic and nihilistic errors.
Combining what works in eternalism and nihilism amounts to the complete stance—which is essentially the same thing as the "fluid mode."1. 
Rao postulates three groups in any organization: the Clueless, the Losers, and the Sociopaths. The Clueless mistakenly believe that the organization is actually supposed to do whatever it pretends to be for: selling widgets, saving endangered herons, or educating school-children, for instance. They are dedicated to this mission and work hard, and creatively, to further it. The Losers have a job because they need a paycheck; their motivation is to make work reasonably pleasant in exchange for minimal effort. The Sociopaths recognize the reality that the organization is just the setting for a power game played among themselves. Nobody really cares about widgets, herons, or other people’s children. The Losers also understand this, but don’t have what it takes to play the game.
In subcultures, Geeks are roughly parallel to the Clueless; they are passionate about whatever the subculture is supposedly about. Mops substitute for Losers: they show up for a reasonably pleasant time in exchange for minimal effort. Sociopaths are Sociopaths. The detailed dynamics are rather different, though; for instance, the Gervais Principle says that organizations begin with Sociopaths and end up with mostly Clueless, whereas subcultures begin with Geeks and end with mostly Mops.2. I’m using "geek" here to mean "someone fascinated by the details of a subject most people don’t care about." There’s another sense of  "geek," meaning the sort of person you’d expect to find at a science fiction convention. There’s significant overlap, but in the first sense there are gardening geeks and golfing geeks, and most probably aren’t geeks in the second sense. They might create gardening subcultures, though.3. "MOP" is an abbreviation for "member of the public"; it seems to be fairly common in Britain. My American (mis-)use of it here is probably somewhat non-standard. Other terms that could be used are "casuals" or "tourists."4. All the categories here—creators, fanatics, mops, sociopaths—are necessarily nebulous: ambiguous and changing over time. There is no "fact of the matter" about whether someone is an unusually enthusiastic mop, or a fanatic who is less committed than some other fanatics; nor whether someone who creates occasionally but mainly acts to support the subculture counts as a fanatic or creator. Anyone may shift roles, too.5. I am using "sociopath" here in Rao’s informal sense, not a technical, clinical one.6. I’ll discuss these barriers more extensively in upcoming writing.7. "Poseur" was perhaps directed even more at sociopaths than mops, but didn’t clearly distinguish between the two.    Tweet28 Comments

June 29th, 2019
At Doist we believe that open and sincere communication improves our decision-making process. That’s why we’ve built a culture that encourages feedback at all levels of decision-making: from purely technical solutions to team and product management. We built our team communication app, Twist, around public threads to make that level of transparency and engagement possible for both ourselves and other remote workplaces.
Initially, we thought that the more input you get, the better your decisions will be. (This idea aligns quite naturally with the engineering ethos that more data means better decisions).
However, as our team has grown, we’ve learned that too much of a good thing is not a good thing. I once witnessed one of our designers ask the team for feedback on a draft of the Twist logo. All of a sudden everybody turned into font and logo experts (I was guilty as well) and overwhelmed him with feedback.Initially, we thought that the more input you get, the better your decisions will be.As the leader of Doist’s back-end team, I saw this kind of feedback overload as a big challenge to our team’s ability to operate efficiently. There were too many inputs. And more and more time was spent responding to feedback rather than executing on decisions. That’s when I came across a document detailing the principles of "rough consensus".Rough consensusThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a membership-based organization of designers, operators, vendors, and researchers that develop the standards that have shaped the internet into the tool we use today. Their main decision-making principle was coined by Dave Clark in 1992:We reject: kings, presidents, and voting.
We believe in: rough consensus and running code.I’ve always been curious about what "rough consensus" means. How do you actually know when you reach one?How does a group of people make the best decision without "kings" in situations where there’s no obvious right answer?As it turns out, there is a document that explains in detail the process and the ideology behind the IETF’s approach to decision-making called "RFC 7282. On Consensus and Humming in the IETF." It provides very practical guidelines on how to advance technical discussions to converge around a solution without unnecessary delay. This document can be helpful to all of us, especially product leadership and squad leaders.
IETF faces the same challenges all technology teams do as they shape the product and specify the behavior of its components. As the document puts it:"Engineering always involves a set of tradeoffs. It is almost certain that any time engineering choices need to be made, there will be options that appeal to some people, but are not appealing to some others."The question becomes: how does a group of people make the best decision without "kings" in situations where there’s no obvious right answer? A shared understanding around how decisions are made is necessary.Voting by hummingIn IETF, they sometimes hum instead of raising their hands when they need to vote. The idea is to make voting more anonymous and also fight the temptation to make decisions based solely on the number of votes. As emphasized in the document, humming gives the person deciding the opportunity to "take the temperature of the room". It’s just one tool they use to move the discussion forward, rather than end it.
While this approach can’t be replicated exactly on a remote team for obvious reasons, it does illustrate some of the main principles behind rough consensus and what distinguishes it from top-down decision-making on the one hand and majority-rule decision-making on the other."Not the best choice" versus fundamental flaws feedbackRough consensus relies on the distinction between two types of objections:"Not the best choice" feedback: "I don’t believe Solution A is the best choice, because XYZ. I believe Solution B would be better, but I accept that Solution A can work too."Fundamental flaws: "I believe Solution A is unacceptable because XYZ."Rough consensus isn’t majority rule. It’s okay to go ahead with a solution that may not look like the best choice for everyone or even the majority. "Not the best choice" means that you believe there is a better way to solve the problem, but you accept that this one will work too. That type of feedback should be welcomed, but it shouldn’t be allowed to slow down a decision.Once everyone can live with a given solution, you’ve reached rough consensus, even if there are outstanding objections.On the other hand, it’s crucial to address and discuss all fundamental flaws before the discussion is done. Fundamental flaws are critical issues that should disqualify a proposed solution. It’s hard to define what qualifies as a fundamental flaw, but a few starting points are:It will substantially increase the technical debt.It doesn’t scale well (unless the specific circumstance does not require scalability).It requires too much work to implement, and it doesn’t justify the value which the solution adds.This list is not complete, and other teams will of course define a fundamental flaw differently. For example, based on our values of respecting users’ time, attention, and intentions, the product design team may consider any solution that unnecessarily distracts the user to be fundamentally flawed. Based on our company’s priority to remain an independent and sustainable company, the marketing team may consider any solution that costs more than the revenue it will bring in to be fundamentally flawed.
It is important for an organization to have a shared understanding of what "fundamentally flawed" means going into a discussion of proposed solutions, even if the definition evolves over time.The art of asking for inputHow do you ensure that fundamental flaws are fully addressed without stifling or getting slowed down by non-critical feedback? Here’s how the IETF recommends moving toward rough consensus when a discussion has stalled:A chair who asks, "Is everyone OK with choice A?" is going to get objections. But a chair who asks, "Can anyone not live with choice A?" is more likely to only hear from folks who think that choice A is impossible to engineer given some constraints. The objector might convince the rest of the group that the objections are valid and the working group might choose a different path.As you can see, an objector can’t simply say "I don’t like solution A" or even object by providing an alternative that they believe is better — they have to first prove why solution A has fundamental flaws.
Once everyone can live with a given solution, you’ve reached rough consensus, even if there are outstanding objections.On compromisesA substantial part of the IETF document is dedicated to the question of compromises, distinguishing between two types:Unfortunately, the word "compromise" gets used in two different ways […] Engineering always involves balancing tradeoffs […]: We might have to compromise processor speed for lower power consumption, or compromise throughput for congestion resistance. Those sorts of compromises are among engineering choices, and they are expected and essential. […].
However, there is another sense of "compromise" that involves compromising between people, not engineering principles. For example, a minority of a group might object to a particular proposal, and even after discussion still think the proposal is deeply problematic, but decide that they don’t have the energy to argue against it and say, "Forget it, do what you want". That surely can be called a compromise […] but really all that they’ve done is capitulated. That’s not coming to consensus; there still exists an outstanding unaddressed objection.
Again, if the objection is only that the choice is not ideal but is otherwise acceptable, such a compromise is fine. But conceding when there is a real outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus.Sometimes there’s a temptation to jump into a Twist thread and add a quick "two cents" to an ongoing discussion. Chances are, those two cents will be either truisms that probably aren’t worth sharing in the first place or opinions which require further explanation to fully justify.If it’s not worth spending the time to over-communicate your point, the feedback is probably not worth slowing down the discussion for.In the latter case, the decision-maker will likely either ignore your feedback since they don’t fully understand it or have to follow up with you to get to the root of your objections. Do what you can to provide them with the information they need to evaluate your argument up front. If you believe your feedback to be critical, say so and spend the extra time explaining and defending your position from the start.
This is especially important in the context of remote teams. Here we lack the luxury of quick back and forth communications to clarify the point, and a person’s two cents can seriously slow down the decision-making process.
If it’s not worth spending the time to over-communicate your point, the feedback is probably not worth slowing down the discussion for.Doesn’t rough consensus contradict the perfectionism we preach?The rough consensus approach contrasts with the "if it’s not a ‘hell yeah’, it’s a no" criterium we’ve adopted for hiring (i.e., reject a candidate unless everyone is in enthusiastic agreement). However, I believe a lower decision-making standard is acceptable, and even necessary, for most of the technical and product-related challenges we face.
We may use the "hell yeah" principle for hiring and some other decisions, but we use the quick iteration principle when we ship things. We don’t aim for perfection the first time — we build fast, we ship, we learn, we iterate, and we ship again. Step by step, we get to where we want to be. If we applied a standard of perfection and complete consensus to the things we shipped, we’d quickly become sluggish.We risk more when we delay decisions in an attempt to reach total consensus.Thanks to our "hell yeah" approach to hiring, we can trust the competence and diligence of the person making the decision. Yes, with rough consensus we risk not making the best choice, but if the decider believes it’s the best solution, we can trust it to be adequate.
Even if it turns out to not be the best decision, in the end, the increased speed at which we’re able to operate will, on average, compensate for the setbacks. We risk more when we delay decisions in an attempt to reach total consensus.
Rough consensus doesn’t mean that we don’t aim for perfection in the actual implementation of the solution. When implementing, we should always aim for technical excellence. Commitment to the implementation is often what makes a solution the right one. (This is similar to Amazon’s "disagree and commitment" philosophy.)What we can learn from the IETF’s rough consensus (a.k.a. why share all of this)The IETF case is a good example of how organizations with different structures and cultures solve the universal problem of decision-making.
I’m not proposing we apply rough consensus to all of our decisions. We are not the IETF — our goals and structure are quite different. However, I believe there are valuable lessons we can draw from their experience.If there is a good enough solution X, don’t ask people what they think about it. Instead, ask everyone if they can live with it and if not, why.We aim to maintain a relatively flat, transparent, and inclusive organization. As a result, consensus-based decision-making comes more naturally to us than top-down decision-making. How do we harness the benefits of collective input while making decisions quickly?
Rough consensus is a good standard for ensuring that minor remarks or non-critical issues don’t impede our performance, and it’s an effective tool in our belt as more and more voices are added to the team.
Here are some concrete takeaways we can all apply for more efficient and effective decision-making:
If you’re the one raising objections to a solution:Before you object, weigh whether or not your objection reveals a serious issue. It’s okay to make a remark like "I believe there is a better decision and it’s this, but I’m also okay with the current choice." It’s also okay to suggest improvements to the idea (or the implementation, if you’re discussing a pull request for example) without vetoing the current choice. Make clear what type of objection you’re raising.If you believe the choice has a blocking flaw, try to make your feedback as clear as possible so that the decision-maker can address it properly.If you believe the choice has a blocking flaw, try to find enough time and energy to convince opponents. When you differentiate between non-critical feedback and a fundamental flaw and prioritize the latter, you’re able to conserve the time and mental energy for the most important discussions.If you’re the one deciding:Be vigilant and make sure the discussion doesn’t stall on non-critical, "not the best solution" feedback.If there is a discussion which cannot converge, ask participants to clarify if objections to a proposal address fundamental flaws or remarks which should be taken in consideration.If there is a good enough solution X, don’t ask people what they think about it. Instead, ask everyone if they can live with it and if not, why.Don’t feel like you have to default to majority rule.Consensus is the path, not the destinationA final quote from the IETF document:We don’t try to reach consensus in the IETF as an end in itself. We use consensus-building as a tool to get to the best technical (and sometimes procedural) outcome when we make decisions.At Doist we strive to create a culture where everyone’s feedback is heard. We believe we’re a stronger company for it. But as we’ve learned, this requires effort and self-awareness from all parties to the discussion. We’re not there yet, but the principles of rough consensus can be useful in balancing feedback and efficiency in all of our decision-making.#clippingKeep in touch!

November 26th, 2015
When my daughter Nicole was an infant, I read an essay suggesting that it might no longer be necessary to teach children how to read or write, because speech recognition and synthesis would soon render those abilities superfluous. My wife and I were horrified by the idea, and we resolved that, no matter how sophisticated technology became, our daughter’s skills would always rest on the bedrock of traditional literacy.
It turned out that we and the essayist were both half correct: now that she’s an adult, Nicole can read as well as I can. But there is a sense in which she has lost the ability to write. She doesn’t dictate her messages and ask a virtual secretary to read back to her what she last said, the way that essayist predicted; Nicole subvocalizes, her retinal projector displays the words in her field of vision, and she makes revisions using a combination of gestures and eye movements. For all practical purposes, she can write. But take away the assistive software and give her nothing but a keyboard like the one I remain faithful to, and she’d have difficulty spelling out many of the words in this very sentence. Under those specific circumstances, English becomes a bit like a second language to her, one that she can speak fluently but can only barely write.
It may sound like I’m disappointed in Nicole’s intellectual achievements, but that’s absolutely not the case. She’s smart and dedicated to her job at an art museum when she could be earning more money elsewhere, and I’ve always been proud of her accomplishments. But there is still the past me who would have been appalled to see his daughter lose her ability to spell, and I can’t deny that I am continuous with him.
It’s been more than twenty years since I read that essay, and in that period our lives have undergone countless changes that I couldn’t have predicted. The most catastrophic one was when Nicole’s mother Angela declared that she deserved a more interesting life than the one we were giving her, and spent the next decade criss-crossing the globe. But the changes leading to Nicole’s current form of literacy were more ordinary and gradual: a succession of software gadgets that not only promised but in fact delivered utility and convenience, and I didn’t object to any of them at the times of their introduction.
So it hasn’t been my habit to engage in doomsaying whenever a new product is announced; I’ve welcomed new technology as much as anyone. But when Whetstone released its new search tool Remem, it raised concerns for me in a way none of its predecessors did.
Millions of people, some my age but most younger, have been keeping lifelogs for years, wearing personal cams that capture continuous video of their entire lives. People consult their lifelogs for a variety of reasons—everything from reliving favorite moments to tracking down the cause of allergic reactions—but only intermittently; no one wants to spend all their time formulating queries and sifting through the results. Lifelogs are the most complete photo album imaginable, but like most photo albums, they lie dormant except on special occasions. Now Whetstone aims to change all of that; they claim Remem’s algorithms can search the entire haystack by the time you’ve finished saying "needle."
Remem monitors your conversation for references to past events, and then displays video of that event in the lower left corner of your field of vision. If you say "remember dancing the conga at that wedding?", Remem will bring up the video. If the person you’re talking to says "the last time we were at the beach," Remem will bring up the video. And it’s not only for use when speaking with someone else; Remem also monitors your subvocalizations. If you read the words "the first Szechuan restaurant you ate at," your vocal cords will move as if you’re reading aloud, and Remem will bring up the relevant video.
There’s no denying the usefulness of software that can actually answer the question "where did I put my keys?" But Whetstone is positioning Remem as more than a handy virtual assistant: they want it to take the place of your natural memory.

It was the summer of Jijingi’s thirteenth year when a European came to live in the village. The dusty harmattan winds had just begun blowing from the north when Sabe, the elder who was regarded as chief by all the local families, made the announcement.
Everyone’s initial reaction was alarm, of course. "What have we done wrong?" Jijingi’s father asked Sabe.
Europeans had first come to Tivland many years ago, and while some elders said one day they’d leave and life would return to the ways of the past, until that day arrived it was necessary for the Tiv to get along with them. This had meant many changes in the way the Tiv did things, but it had never meant Europeans living among them before. The usual reason for Europeans to come to the village was to collect taxes for the roads they had built; they visited some clans more often because the people refused to pay taxes, but that hadn’t happened in the Shangev clan. Sabe and the other clan elders had agreed that paying the taxes was the best strategy.
Sabe told everyone not to worry. "This European is a missionary; that means all he does is pray. He has no authority to punish us, but our making him welcome will please the men in the administration."
He ordered two huts built for the missionary, a sleeping hut and a reception hut. Over the course of the next several days everyone took time off from harvesting the guinea-corn to help lay bricks, sink posts into the ground, weave grass into thatch for the roof. It was during the final step, pounding the floor, that the missionary arrived. His porters appeared first, the boxes they carried visible from a distance as they threaded their way between the cassava fields; the missionary himself was the last to appear, apparently exhausted even though he carried nothing. His name was Moseby, and he thanked everyone who had worked on the huts. He tried to help, but it quickly became clear that he didn’t know how to do anything, so eventually he just sat in the shade of a locust bean tree and wiped his head with a piece of cloth.
Jijingi watched the missionary with curiosity. The man opened one of his boxes and took out what at first looked like a block of wood, but then he split it open and Jijingi realized it was a tightly bound sheaf of papers. Jijingi had seen paper before; when the Europeans collected taxes, they gave paper in return so that the village had proof of what they’d paid. But the paper that the missionary was looking at was obviously of a different sort, and must have had some other purpose.
The man noticed Jijingi looking at him, and invited him to come closer. "My name is Moseby," he said. "What is your name?"
"I am Jijingi, and my father is Orga of the Shangev clan."
Moseby spread open the sheaf of paper and gestured toward it. "Have you heard the story of Adam?" he asked. "Adam was the first man. We are all children of Adam."
"Here we are descendants of Shangev," said Jijingi. "And everyone in Tivland is a descendant of Tiv."
"Yes, but your ancestor Tiv was descended from Adam, just as my ancestors were. We are all brothers. Do you understand?"
The missionary spoke as if his tongue were too large for his mouth, but Jijingi could tell what he was saying. "Yes, I understand."
Moseby smiled, and pointed at the paper. "This paper tells the story of Adam."
"How can paper tell a story?"
"It is an art that we Europeans know. When a man speaks, we make marks on the paper. When another man looks at the paper later, he sees the marks and knows what sounds the first man made. In that way the second man can hear what the first man said."
Jijingi remembered something his father had told him about old Gbegba, who was the most skilled in bushcraft. "Where you or I would see nothing but some disturbed grass, he can see that a leopard had killed a cane rat at that spot and carried it off," his father said. Gbegba was able to look at the ground and know what had happened even though he had not been present. This art of the Europeans must be similar: those who were skilled in interpreting the marks could hear a story even if they hadn’t been there when it was told.
"Tell me the story that the paper tells," he said.
Moseby told him a story about Adam and his wife being tricked by a snake. Then he asked Jijingi, "How do you like it?"
"You’re a poor storyteller, but the story was interesting enough."
Moseby laughed. "You are right, I am not good at the Tiv language. But this is a good story. It is the oldest story we have. It was first told long before your ancestor Tiv was born."
Jijingi was dubious. "That paper can’t be so old."
"No, this paper is not. But the marks on it were copied from older paper. And those marks were copied from older paper. And so forth many times."
That would be impressive, if true. Jijingi liked stories, and older stories were often the best. "How many stories do you have there?"
"Very many." Moseby flipped through the sheaf of papers, and Jijingi could see each sheet was covered with marks from edge to edge; there must be many, many stories there.
"This art you spoke of, interpreting marks on paper; is it only for Europeans?"
"No, I can teach it to you. Would you like that?"

Cautiously, Jijingi nodded.

As a journalist, I have long appreciated the usefulness of lifelogging for determining the facts of the matter. There is scarcely a legal proceeding, criminal or civil, that doesn’t make use of someone’s lifelog, and rightly so. When the public interest is involved, finding out what actually happened is important; justice is an essential part of the social contract, and you can’t have justice until you know the truth.
However, I’ve been much more skeptical about the use of lifelogging in purely personal situations. When lifelogging first became popular, there were couples who thought they could use it to settle arguments over who had actually said what, using the video record to prove they were right. But finding the right clip of video often wasn’t easy, and all but the most determined gave up on doing so. The inconvenience acted as a barrier, limiting the searching of lifelogs to those situations in which effort was warranted, namely situations in which justice was the motivating factor.
Now with Remem, finding the exact moment has become easy, and lifelogs that previously lay all but ignored are now being scrutinized as if they were crime scenes, thickly strewn with evidence for use in domestic squabbles.
I typically write for the news section, but I’ve written feature stories as well, and so when I pitched an article about the potential downsides of Remem to my managing editor, he gave me the go-ahead. My first interview was with a married couple whom I’ll call Joel and Deirdre, an architect and a painter, respectively. It wasn’t hard to get them talking about Remem.
"Joel is always saying that he knew it all along," said Deirdre, "even when he didn’t. It used to drive me crazy, because I couldn’t get him to admit he used to believe something else. Now I can. For example, recently we were talking about the McKittridge kidnapping case."
She sent me the video of one argument she had with Joel. My retinal projector displayed footage of a cocktail party; it’s from Deirdre’s point of view, and Joel is telling a number of people, "It was pretty clear that he was guilty from the day he was arrested."
Deirdre’s voice: "You didn’t always think that. For months you argued that he was innocent."
Joel shakes his head. "No, you’re misremembering. I said that even people who are obviously guilty deserve a fair trial."
"That’s not what you said. You said he was being railroaded."
"You’re thinking of someone else; that wasn’t me."
"No, it was you. Look." A separate video window opened up, an excerpt of her lifelog that she looked up and broadcast to the people they’ve been talking with. Within the nested video, Joel and Deirdre are sitting in a café, and Joel is saying, "He’s a scapegoat. The police needed to reassure the public, so they arrested a convenient suspect. Now he’s done for." Deidre replies, "You don’t think there’s any chance of him being acquitted?" and Joel answers, "Not unless he can afford a high-powered defense team, and I’ll bet you he can’t. People in his position will never get a fair trial."
I closed both windows, and Deirdre said, "Without Remem, I’d never be able to convince him that he changed his position. Now I have proof."
"Fine, you were right that time," said Joel. "But you didn’t have to do that in front of our friends."
"You correct me in front of our friends all the time. You’re telling me I can’t do the same?"
Here was the line at which the pursuit of truth ceased to be an intrinsic good. When the only persons affected have a personal relationship with each other, other priorities are often more important, and a forensic pursuit of the truth could be harmful. Did it really matter whose idea it was to take the vacation that turned out so disastrously? Did you need to know which partner was more forgetful about completing errands the other person asked of them? I was no expert on marriage, but I knew what marriage counselors said: pinpointing blame wasn’t the answer. Instead, couples needed to acknowledge each other’s feelings and address their problems as a team.
Next I spoke with a spokesperson from Whetstone, Erica Meyers. For a while she gave me a typically corporate spiel about the benefits of Remem. "Making information more accessible is an intrinsic good," she says. "Ubiquitous video has revolutionized law enforcement. Businesses become more effective when they adopt good record-keeping practices. The same thing happens to us as individuals when our memories become more accurate: we get better, not just at doing our jobs, but at living our lives."
When I asked her about couples like Joel and Deirdre, she said, "If your marriage is solid, Remem isn’t going to hurt it. But if you’re the type of person who’s constantly trying to prove that you’re right and your spouse is wrong, then your marriage is going to be in trouble whether you use Remem or not."
I conceded that she may have had a point in this particular case. But, I asked her, didn’t she think Remem created greater opportunities for those types of arguments to arise, even in solid marriages, by making it easier for people to keep score?
"Not at all," she said. "Remem didn’t give them a scorekeeping mentality; they developed that on their own. Another couple could just as easily use Remem to realize that they’ve both misremembered things, and become more forgiving when that sort of mistake happens. I predict the latter scenario will be the more common one with our customers as a whole."

I wished I could share Erica Meyers’ optimism, but I knew that new technology didn’t always bring out the best in people. Who hasn’t wished they could prove that their version of events was the correct one? I could easily see myself using Remem the way Deirdre did, and I wasn’t at all certain that doing so would be good for me. Anyone who has wasted hours surfing the internet knows that technology can encourage bad habits.

Moseby gave a sermon every seven days, on the day devoted to resting and brewing and drinking beer. He seemed to disapprove of the beer drinking, but he didn’t want to speak on one of the days of work, so the day of beer brewing was the only one left. He talked about the European god, and told people that following his rules would improve their lives, but his explanations of how that would do so weren’t particularly persuasive.

But Moseby also had some skill at dispensing medicine, and he was willing to learn how to work in the fields, so gradually people grew more accepting of him, and Jijingi’s father let him visit Moseby occasionally to learn the art of writing. Moseby offered to teach the other children as well, and for a time Jijingi’s age-mates came along, mostly to prove to each other that they weren’t afraid of being near a European. Before long the other boys grew bored and left, but because Jijingi remained interested in writing and his father thought it would keep the Europeans happy, he was eventually permitted to go every day.
Moseby explained to Jijingi how each sound a person spoke could be indicated with different marks on the paper. The marks were arranged in rows like plants in a field; you looked at the marks as if you were walking down a row, made the sound each mark indicated, and you would find yourself speaking what the original person had said. Moseby showed him how to make each of the different marks on a sheet of paper, using a tiny wooden rod that had a core of soot.
In a typical lesson, Moseby would speak, and then write what he had said: "When night comes I shall sleep." Tugh mba a ile yo me yav. "There are two persons." Ioruv mban mba uhar. Jijingi carefully copied the writing on his sheet of paper, and when he was done, Moseby would look at it.
"Very good. But you need to leave spaces when you write."
"I have." Jijingi pointed at the gap between each row.
"No, that is not what I mean. Do you see the spaces within each line?" He pointed at his own paper.
Jijingi understood. "Your marks are clumped together, while mine are arranged evenly."
"These are not just clumps of marks. They are… I do not know what you call them." He picked up a thin sheaf of paper from his table and flipped through it. "I do not see it here. Where I come from, we call them ‘words.’ When we write, we leave spaces between the words."
"But what are words?"
"How can I explain it?" He thought a moment. "If you speak slowly, you pause very briefly after each word. That’s why we leave a space in those places when we write. Like this: How. Many. Years. Old. Are. You?" He wrote on his paper as he spoke, leaving a space every time he paused: Anyom a ou kuma a me?
"But you speak slowly because you’re a foreigner. I’m Tiv, so I don’t pause when I speak. Shouldn’t my writing be the same?"
"It does not matter how fast you speak. Words are the same whether you speak quickly or slowly."
"Then why did you say you pause after each word?"
"That is the easiest way to find them. Try saying this very slowly." He pointed at what he’d just written.
Jijingi spoke very slowly, the way a man might when trying to hide his drunkenness. "Why is there no space in between an and yom?"
"Anyom is one word. You do not pause in the middle of it."
"But I wouldn’t pause after anyom either."
Moseby sighed. "I will think more about how to explain what I mean. For now, just leave spaces in the places where I leave spaces."
What a strange art writing was. When sowing a field, it was best to have the seed yams spaced evenly; Jijingi’s father would have beaten him if he’d clumped the yams the way the Moseby clumped his marks on paper. But he had resolved to learn this art as best he could, and if that meant clumping his marks, he would do so.
It was only many lessons later that Jijingi finally understood where he should leave spaces, and what Moseby meant when he said "word." You could not find the places where words began and ended by listening. The sounds a person made while speaking were as smooth and unbroken as the hide of a goat’s leg, but the words were like the bones underneath the meat, and the space between them was the joint where you’d cut if you wanted to separate it into pieces. By leaving spaces when he wrote, Moseby was making visible the bones in what he said.

Jijingi realized that, if he thought hard about it, he was now able to identify the words when people spoke in an ordinary conversation. The sounds that came from a person’s mouth hadn’t changed, but he understood them differently; he was aware of the pieces from which the whole was made. He himself had been speaking in words all along. He just hadn’t known it until now.

The ease of searching that Remem provides is impressive enough, but that merely scratches the surface of what Whetstone sees as the product’s potential. When Deirdre fact-checked her husband’s previous statements, she was posing explicit queries to Remem. But Whetstone expects that, as people become accustomed to their product, queries will take the place of ordinary acts of recall, and Remem will be integrated into their very thought processes. Once that happens, we will become cognitive cyborgs, effectively incapable of misremembering anything; digital video stored on error-corrected silicon will take over the role once filled by our fallible temporal lobes.
What might it be like to have a perfect memory? Arguably the individual with the best memory ever documented was Solomon Shereshevskii, who lived in Russia during the first half of the twentieth century. The psychologists who tested him found that he could hear a series of words or numbers once and remember it months or even years later. With no knowledge of Italian, Shereshevskii was able to quote stanzas of The Divine Comedy that had been read to him fifteen years earlier.
But having a perfect memory wasn’t the blessing one might imagine it to be. Reading a passage of text evoked so many images in Shereshevskii’s mind that he often couldn’t focus on what it actually said, and his awareness of innumerable specific examples made it difficult for him to understand abstract concepts. At times, he tried to deliberately forget things. He wrote down numbers he no longer wanted to remember on slips of paper and then burnt them, a kind of slash-and-burn approach to clearing out the undergrowth of his mind, but to no avail.
When I raised the possibility that a perfect memory might be a handicap to Whetstone’s spokesperson, Erica Meyers, she had a ready reply. "This is no different from the concerns people used to have about retinal projectors," she said. "They worried that seeing updates constantly would be distracting or overwhelming, but we’ve all adapted to them."
I didn’t mention that not everyone considered that a positive development.
"And Remem is entirely customizable," she continued. "If at any time you find it’s doing too many searches for your needs, you can decrease its level of responsiveness. But according to our customer analytics, our users haven’t been doing that. As they become more comfortable with it, they’re finding that Remem becomes more helpful the more responsive it is."
But even if Remem wasn’t constantly crowding your field of vision with unwanted imagery of the past, I wondered if there weren’t issues raised simply by having that imagery be perfect.
"Forgive and forget" goes the expression, and for our idealized magnanimous selves, that was all you needed. But for our actual selves the relationship between those two actions wasn’t so straightforward. In most cases we had to forget a little bit before we could forgive; when we no longer experienced the pain as fresh, the insult was easier to forgive, which in turn made it less memorable, and so on. It was this psychological feedback loop that made initially infuriating offences seem pardonable in the mirror of hindsight.
What I feared was that Remem would make it impossible for this feedback loop to get rolling. By fixing every detail of an insult in indelible video, it could prevent the softening that’s needed for forgiveness to begin. I thought back to what Erica Meyers said about Remem’s inability to hurt solid marriages. Implicit in that assertion was a claim about what qualified as a solid marriage. If someone’s marriage was built on—as ironic as it might sound—a cornerstone of forgetfulness, what right did Whetstone have to shatter that?
The issue wasn’t confined to marriages; all sorts of relationships rely on forgiving and forgetting. My daughter Nicole has always been strong-willed; rambunctious when she was a child, openly defiant as an adolescent. She and I had many furious arguments during her teen years, arguments that we have mostly been able to put behind us, and now our relationship is pretty good. If we’d had Remem, would we still be speaking to each other?
I don’t mean to say that forgetting is the only way to mend relationships. While I can no longer recall most of the arguments Nicole and I had—and I’m grateful that I can’t—one of the arguments I remember clearly is one that spurred me to be a better father.
It was when Nicole was sixteen, a junior in high school. It had been two years since her mother Angela had left, probably the two hardest years of both our lives. I don’t remember what started the argument—something trivial, no doubt—but it escalated and before long Nicole was taking her anger at Angela out on me.
"You’re the reason she left! You drove her away! You can leave too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you." And to demonstrate her point, she stormed out of the house.
I knew it wasn’t premeditated malice on her part—I don’t think she engaged in much premeditation in anything during that phase of her life—but she couldn’t have come up with a more hurtful accusation if she’d tried. I’d been devastated by Angela’s departure, and I was constantly wondering what I could have done differently to keep her.
Nicole didn’t come back until the next day, and that night was one of soul searching for me. While I didn’t believe I was responsible for her mother leaving us, Nicole’s accusation still served as a wake-up call. I hadn’t been conscious of it, but I realized that I had been thinking of myself as the greatest victim of Angela’s departure, wallowing in self-pity over just how unreasonable my situation was. It hadn’t even been my idea to have children; it was Angela who’d wanted to be a parent, and now she had left me holding the bag. What sane world would leave me with sole responsibility for raising an adolescent girl? How could a job that was so difficult be entrusted to someone with no experience whatsoever?
Nicole’s accusation made me realize her predicament was worse than mine. At least I had volunteered for this duty, albeit long ago and without full appreciation for what I was getting into. Nicole had been drafted into her role, with no say whatsoever. If there was anyone who had a right to be resentful, it was her. And while I thought I’d been doing a good job of being a father, obviously I needed to do better.
I turned myself around. Our relationship didn’t improve overnight, but over the years I was able to work myself back into Nicole’s good graces. I remember the way she hugged me at her college graduation, and I realized my years of effort had paid off.

Would those years of repair have been possible with Remem? Even if each of us could have refrained from throwing the other’s bad behavior in their faces, the opportunity to privately rewatch video of our arguments seems like it could be pernicious. Vivid reminders of the way she and I yelled at each other in the past might have kept our anger fresh, and prevented us from rebuilding our relationship.

Jijingi wanted to write down some of the stories of where the Tiv people came from, but the storytellers spoke rapidly, and he wasn’t able to write fast enough to keep up with them. Moseby said he would get better with practice, but Jijingi despaired that he’d ever become fast enough.
Then, one summer a European woman named Reiss came to visit the village. Moseby said she was "a person who learns about other people" but could not explain what that meant, only that she wanted to learn about Tivland. She asked questions of everyone, not just the elders but young men, too, even women and children, and she wrote down everything they told her. She didn’t try to get anyone to adopt European practices; where Moseby had insisted that there were no such thing as curses and that everything was God’s will, Reiss asked about how curses worked, and listened attentively to explanations of how your kin on your father’s side could curse you while your kin on your mother’s side could protect you from curses.
One evening Kokwa, the best storyteller in the village, told the story of how the Tiv people split into different lineages, and Reiss had written it down exactly as he told it. Later she had recopied the story using a machine she poked at noisily with her fingers, so that she had a copy that was clean and easy to read. When Jijingi asked if she would make another copy for him, she agreed, much to his excitement.
The paper version of the story was curiously disappointing. Jijingi remembered that when he had first learned about writing, he’d imagined it would enable him to see a storytelling performance as vividly as if he were there. But writing didn’t do that. When Kokwa told the story, he didn’t merely use words; he used the sound of his voice, the movement of his hands, the light in his eyes. He told you the story with his whole body, and you understood it the same way. None of that was captured on paper; only the bare words could be written down. And reading just the words gave you only a hint of the experience of listening to Kokwa himself, as if one were licking the pot in which okra had been cooked instead of eating the okra itself.
Jijingi was still glad to have the paper version, and would read it from time to time. It was a good story, worthy of being recorded on paper. Not everything written on paper was so worthy. During his sermons Moseby would read aloud stories from his book, and they were often good stories, but he also read aloud words he had written down just a few days before, and those were often not stories at all, merely claims that learning more about the European god would improve the lives of the Tiv people.
One day, when Moseby had been eloquent, Jijingi complimented him. "I know you think highly of all your sermons, but today’s sermon was a good one."
"Thank you," said Moseby, smiling. After a moment, he asked, "Why do you say I think highly of all my sermons?"
"Because you expect that people will want to read them many years from now."
"I don’t expect that. What makes you think that?"
"You write them all down before you even deliver them. Before even one person has heard a sermon, you have written it down for future generations."
Moseby laughed. "No, that is not why I write them down."
"Why, then?" He knew it wasn’t for people far away to read them, because sometimes messengers came to the village to deliver paper to Moseby, and he never sent his sermons back with them.
"I write the words down so I do not forget what I want to say when I give the sermon."
"How could you forget what you want to say? You and I are speaking right now, and neither of us needs paper to do so."
"A sermon is different from conversation." Moseby paused to consider. "I want to be sure I give my sermons as well as possible. I won’t forget what I want to say, but I might forget the best way to say it. If I write it down, I don’t have to worry. But writing the words down does more than help me remember. It helps me think."
"How does writing help you think?"
"That is a good question," he said. "It is strange, isn’t it? I do not know how to explain it, but writing helps me decide what I want to say. Where I come from, there’s a very old proverb: verba volant, scripta manent. In Tiv you would say, ‘spoken words fly away, written words remain.’ Does that make sense?"
"Yes," Jijingi said, just to be polite; it made no sense at all. The missionary wasn’t old enough to be senile, but his memory must be terrible and he didn’t want to admit it. Jijingi told his age-mates about this, and they joked about it amongst themselves for days. Whenever they exchanged gossip, they would add, "Will you remember that? This will help you," and mimic Moseby writing at his table.
On an evening the following year, Kokwa announced he would tell the story of how the Tiv split into different lineages. Jijingi brought out the paper version he had, so he could read the story at the same time Kokwa told it. Sometimes he could follow along, but it was often confusing because Kokwa’s words didn’t match what was written on the paper. After Kokwa was finished, Jijingi said to him, "You didn’t tell the story the same way you told it last year."
"Nonsense," said Kokwa. "When I tell a story it doesn’t change, no matter how much time passes. Ask me to tell it twenty years from today, and I will tell it exactly the same."
Jijingi pointed at the paper he held. "This paper is the story you told last year, and there were many differences." He picked one he remembered. "Last time you said, ‘the Uyengi captured the women and children and carried them off as slaves.’ This time you said, ‘they made slaves of the women, but they did not stop there: they even made slaves of the children.’"
"That’s the same."
"It is the same story, but you’ve changed the way you tell it."
"No," said Kokwa, "I told it just as I told it before."
Jijingi didn’t want to try to explain what words were. Instead he said, "If you told it as you did before, you would say ‘the Uyengi captured the women and children and carried them off as slaves’ every time."
For a moment Kokwa stared at him, and then he laughed. "Is this what you think is important, now that you’ve learned the art of writing?"
Sabe, who had been listening to them, chided Kokwa. "It’s not your place to judge Jijingi. The hare favors one food, the hippo favors another. Let each spend his time as he pleases."
"Of course, Sabe, of course," said Kokwa, but he threw a derisive glance at Jijingi.
Afterwards, Jijingi remembered the proverb Moseby had mentioned. Even though Kokwa was telling the same story, he might arrange the words differently each time he told it; he was skilled enough as a storyteller that the arrangement of words didn’t matter. It was different for Moseby, who never acted anything out when he gave his sermons; for him, the words were what was important. Jijingi realized that Moseby wrote down his sermons not because his memory was terrible, but because he was looking for a specific arrangement of words. Once he found the one he wanted, he could hold on to it for as long as he needed.
Out of curiosity, Jijingi tried imagining he had to deliver a sermon, and began writing down what he would say. Seated on the root of a mango tree with the notebook Moseby had given him, he composed a sermon on tsav, the quality that enabled some men to have power over others, and a subject which Moseby hadn’t understood and had dismissed as foolishness. He read his first attempt to one of his age-mates, who pronounced it terrible, leading them to have a brief shoving match, but afterwards Jijingi had to admit his age-mate was right. He tried writing out his sermon a second time and then a third before he became tired of it and moved on to other topics.

As he practiced his writing, Jijingi came to understand what Moseby had meant; writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.

Psychologists make a distinction between semantic memory—knowledge of general facts—and episodic memory—recollection of personal experiences. We’ve been using technological supplements for semantic memory ever since the invention of writing: first books, then search engines. By contrast, we’ve historically resisted such aids when it comes to episodic memory; few people have ever kept as many diaries or photo albums as they did ordinary books. The obvious reason is convenience; if we wanted a book on the birds of North America, we could consult one that an ornithologist has written, but if we wanted a daily diary, we had to write it for ourselves. But I also wonder if another reason is that, subconsciously, we regarded our episodic memories as such an integral part of our identities that we were reluctant to externalize them, to relegate them to books on a shelf or files on a computer.
That may be about to change. For years parents have been recording their children’s every moment, so even if children weren’t wearing personal cams, their lifelogs were effectively already being compiled. Now parents are having their children wear retinal projectors at younger and younger ages so they can reap the benefits of assistive software agents sooner. Imagine what will happen if children begin using Remem to access those lifelogs: their mode of cognition will diverge from ours because the act of recall will be different. Rather than thinking of an event from her past and seeing it with her mind’s eye, a child will subvocalize a reference to it and watch video footage with her physical eyes. Episodic memory will become entirely technologically mediated.
An obvious drawback to such reliance is the possibility that people might become virtual amnesiacs whenever the software crashes. But just as worrying to me as the prospect of technological failure was that of technological success: how will it change a person’s conception of herself when she’s only seen her past through the unblinking eye of a video camera? Just as there’s a feedback loop in softening harsh memories, there’s also one at work in the romanticization of childhood memories, and disrupting that process will have consequences.
The earliest birthday I remember is my fourth; I remember blowing out the candles on my cake, the thrill of tearing the wrapping paper off the presents. There’s no video of the event, but there are snapshots in the family album, and they are consistent with what I remember. In fact, I suspect I no longer remember the day itself. It’s more likely that I manufactured the memory when I was first shown the snapshots and over time, I’ve imbued it with the emotion I imagine I felt that day. Little by little, over repeated instances of recall, I’ve created a happy memory for myself.
Another of my earliest memories is of playing on the living room rug, pushing toy cars around, while my grandmother worked at her sewing machine; she would occasionally turn and smile warmly at me. There are no photos of that moment, so I know the recollection is mine and mine alone. It is a lovely, idyllic memory. Would I want to be presented with actual footage of that afternoon? No; absolutely not.
Regarding the role of truth in autobiography, the critic Roy Pascal wrote, "On the one side are the truths of fact, on the other the truth of the writer’s feeling, and where the two coincide cannot be decided by any outside authority in advance." Our memories are private autobiographies, and that afternoon with my grandmother features prominently in mine because of the feelings associated with it. What if video footage revealed that my grandmother’s smile was in fact perfunctory, that she was actually frustrated because her sewing wasn’t going well? What’s important to me about that memory is the happiness I associated with it, and I wouldn’t want that jeopardized.
It seemed to me that continuous video of my entire childhood would be full of facts but devoid of feeling, simply because cameras couldn’t capture the emotional dimension of events. As far as the camera was concerned, that afternoon with my grandmother would be indistinguishable from a hundred others. And if I’d grown up with access to all the video footage, there’d have been no way for me to assign more emotional weight to any particular day, no nucleus around which nostalgia could accrete.
And what will the consequences be when people can claim to remember their infancy? I could readily imagine a situation where, if you ask a young person what her earliest memory is, she will simply look baffled; after all, she has video dating back to the day of her birth. The inability to remember the first few years of one’s life—what psychologists call childhood amnesia—might soon be a thing of the past. No more would parents tell their children anecdotes beginning with the words "You don’t remember this because you were just a toddler when it happened." It’ll be as if childhood amnesia is a characteristic of humanity’s childhood, and in ouroboric fashion, our youth will vanish from our memories.
Part of me wanted to stop this, to protect children’s ability to see the beginning of their lives filtered through gauze, to keep those origin stories from being replaced by cold, desaturated video. But maybe they will feel just as warmly about their lossless digital memories as I do of my imperfect, organic memories.
People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments. Which is why, even when we’ve experienced the same events as other individuals, we never constructed identical narratives: the criteria used for selecting moments were different for each of us, and a reflection of our personalities. Each of us noticed the details that caught our attention and remembered what was important to us, and the narratives we built shaped our personalities in turn.

But, I wondered, if everyone remembered everything, would our differences get shaved away? What would happen to our sense of selves? It seemed to me that a perfect memory couldn’t be a narrative any more than unedited security-cam footage could be a feature film.

When Jijingi was twenty, an officer from the administration came to the village to speak with Sabe. He had brought with him a young Tiv man who had attended the mission school in Katsina-Ala. The administration wanted to have a written record of all the disputes brought before the tribal courts, so they were assigning each chief one of these youths to act as a scribe. Sabe had Jijingi come forward, and to the officer he said, "I know you don’t have enough scribes for all of Tivland. Jijingi here has learned to write; he can act as our scribe, and you can send your boy to another village." The officer tested Jijingi’s ability to write, but Moseby had taught him well, and eventually the officer agreed to have him be Sabe’s scribe.
After the officer had left, Jijingi asked Sabe why he hadn’t wanted the boy from Katsina-Ala to be his scribe.
"No one who comes from the mission school can be trusted," said Sabe.
"Why not? Did the Europeans make them liars?"
"They’re partly to blame, but so are we. When the Europeans collected boys for the mission school years ago, most elders gave them the ones they wanted to get rid of, the layabouts and malcontents. Now those boys have returned, and they feel no kinship with anyone. They wield their knowledge of writing like a long gun; they demand their chiefs find them wives, or else they’ll write lies about them and have the Europeans depose them."
Jijingi knew a boy who was always complaining and looking for ways to avoid work; it would be a disaster if someone like him had power over Sabe. "Can’t you tell the Europeans about this?"
"Many have," Sabe answered. "It was Maisho of the Kwande clan who warned me about the scribes; they were installed in Kwande villages first. Maisho was fortunate that the Europeans believed him instead of his scribe’s lies, but he knows of other chiefs who were not so lucky; the Europeans often believe paper over people. I don’t wish to take the chance." He looked at Jijingi seriously. "You are my kin, Jijingi, and kin to everyone in this village. I trust you to write down what I say."
"Yes, Sabe."
Tribal court was held every month, from morning until late afternoon for three days in a row, and it always attracted an audience, sometimes one so large that Sabe had to demand everyone sit to allow the breeze to reach the center of the circle. Jijingi sat next to Sabe and recorded the details of each dispute in a book the officer had left. It was a good job; he was paid out of the fees collected from the disputants, and he was given not just a chair but a small table too, which he could use for writing even when court wasn’t in session. The complaints Sabe heard were varied—one might be about a stolen bicycle, another might be about whether a man was responsible for his neighbor’s crops failing—but most had to do with wives. For one such dispute, Jijingi wrote down the following:
Umem’s wife Girgi has run away from home and gone back to her kin. Her kinsman Anongo has tried to convince her to stay with her husband, but Girgi refuses, and there is no more Anongo can do. Umem demands the return of the £11 he paid as bridewealth. Anongo says he has no money at the moment, and moreover that he was only paid £6.
Sabe requested witnesses for both sides. Anongo says he has witnesses, but they have gone on a trip. Umem produces a witness, who is sworn in. He testifies that he himself counted the £11 that Umem paid to Anongo.
Sabe asks Girgi to return to her husband and be a good wife, but she says she has had all that she can stand of him. Sabe instructs Anongo to repay Umem £11, the first payment to be in three months when his crops are saleable. Anongo agrees.
It was the final dispute of the day, by which time Sabe was clearly tired. "Selling vegetables to pay back bridewealth," he said afterwards, shaking his head. "This wouldn’t have happened when I was a boy."
Jijingi knew what he meant. In the past, the elders said, you conducted exchanges with similar items: if you wanted a goat, you could trade chickens for it; if you wanted to marry a woman, you promised one of your kinswomen to her family. Then the Europeans said they would no longer accept vegetables as payment for taxes, insisting that it be paid in coin. Before long, everything could be exchanged for money; you could use it to buy everything from a calabash to a wife. The elders considered it absurd.
"The old ways are vanishing," agreed Jijingi. He didn’t say that young people preferred things this way, because the Europeans had also decreed that bridewealth could only be paid if the woman consented to the marriage. In the past, a young woman might be promised to an old man with leprous hands and rotting teeth, and have no choice but to marry him. Now a woman could marry the man she favored, as long as he could afford to pay the bridewealth. Jijingi himself was saving money to marry.
Moseby came to watch sometimes, but he found the proceedings confusing, and often asked Jijingi questions afterwards.
"For example, there was the dispute between Umem and Anongo over how much bridewealth was owed. Why was only the witness sworn in?" asked Moseby.
"To ensure that he said precisely what happened."
"But if Umem and Anongo were sworn in, that would have ensured they said precisely what happened too. Anongo was able to lie because he was not sworn in."
"Anongo didn’t lie," said Jijingi. "He said what he considered right, just as Umem did."
"But what Anongo said wasn’t the same as what the witness said."
"But that doesn’t mean he was lying." Then Jijingi remembered something about the European language, and understood Moseby’s confusion. "Our language has two words for what in your language is called ‘true.’ There is what’s right, mimi, and what’s precise, vough. In a dispute the principals say what they consider right; they speak mimi. The witnesses, however, are sworn to say precisely what happened; they speak vough. When Sabe has heard what happened can he decide what action is mimi for everyone. But it’s not lying if the principals don’t speak vough, as long as they speak mimi."
Moseby clearly disapproved. "In the land I come from, everyone who testifies in court must swear to speak vough, even the principals."
Jijingi didn’t see the point of that, but all he said was, "Every tribe has its own customs."
"Yes, customs may vary, but the truth is the truth; it doesn’t change from one person to another. And remember what the Bible says: the truth shall set you free."
"I remember," said Jijingi. Moseby had said that it was knowing God’s truth that had made the Europeans so successful. There was no denying their wealth or power, but who knew what was the cause?

In order to write about Remem, it was only fair that I try it out myself. The problem was that I didn’t have a lifelog for it to index; typically I only activated my personal cam when I was conducting an interview or covering an event. But I’ve certainly spent time in the presence of people who kept lifelogs, and I could make use of what they’d recorded. While all lifelogging software has privacy controls in place, most people also grant basic sharing rights: if your actions were recorded in their lifelog, you have access to the footage in which you’re present. So I launched an agent to assemble a partial lifelog from the footage others had recorded, using my GPS history as the basis for the query. Over the course of a week, my request propagated through social networks and public video archives, and I was rewarded with snippets of video ranging from a few seconds in length to a few hours: not just security-cam footage but excerpts from the lifelogs of friends, acquaintances, and even complete strangers.
The resulting lifelog was of course highly fragmentary compared to what I would have had if I’d been recording video myself, and the footage was all from a third-person perspective rather than the first-person that most lifelogs have, but Remem was able to work with that. I expected that coverage would be thickest in the later years, simply due to the increasing popularity of lifelogs. It was somewhat to my surprise, then, that when I looked at a graph of the coverage, I found a bump in the coverage over a decade ago. Nicole had been keeping a lifelog since she was a teenager, so an unexpectedly large segment of my domestic life was present.
I was initially a bit uncertain of how to test Remem, since I obviously couldn’t ask it to bring up video of an event I didn’t remember. I figured I’d start out with something I did remember. I subvocalized, "The time Vince told me about his trip to Palau."
My retinal projector displayed a window in the lower left corner of my field of vision: I’m having lunch with my friends Vincent and Jeremy. Vincent didn’t maintain a lifelog either, so the footage was from Jeremy’s point of view. I listened to Vincent rave about scuba diving for a minute.
Next I tried something that I only vaguely remembered. "The dinner banquet when I sat between Deborah and Lyle." I didn’t remember who else was sitting at the table, and wondered if Remem could help me identify them.
Sure enough, Deborah had been recording that evening, and with her video I was able to use a recognition agent to identity everyone sitting across from us.
After those initial successes, I had a run of failures; not surprising, considering the gaps in the lifelog. But over the course of an hour-long trip survey of past events, Remem’s performance was generally impressive.
Finally it seemed time for me to try Remem on some memories that were more emotionally freighted. My relationship with Nicole felt strong enough now for me to safely revisit the fights we’d had when she was young. I figured I’d start with the argument I remembered clearly, and work backwards from there.
I subvocalized, "The time Nicole yelled at me ‘you’re the reason she left.’"
The window displays the kitchen of the house we lived in when Nicole was growing up. The footage is from Nicole’s point of view, and I’m standing in front of the stove. It’s obvious we’re fighting.
"You’re the reason she left. You can leave too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you."
The words were just as I remembered them, but it wasn’t Nicole saying them.
It was me.
My first thought was that it must be a fake, that Nicole had edited the video to put her words into my mouth. She must have noticed my request for access to her lifelog footage, and concocted this to teach me a lesson. Or perhaps it was a film she had created to show her friends, to reinforce the stories she told about me. But why was she still so angry at me, that she would do such a thing? Hadn’t we gotten past this?
I started skimming through the video, looking for inconsistencies that would indicate where the edited footage had been spliced in. The subsequent footage showed Nicole running out of the house, just as I remembered, so there wouldn’t be signs of inconsistency there. I rewound the video and started watching the preceding argument.
Initially I was angry as I watched, angry at Nicole for going to such lengths to create this lie, because the preceding footage was all consistent with me being the one who yelled at her. Then some of what I was saying in the video began to sound queasily familiar: complaining about being called to her school again because she’d gotten into trouble, accusing her of spending time with the wrong crowd. But this wasn’t the context in which I’d said those things, was it? I had been voicing my concern, not berating her. Nicole must have adapted things I’d said elsewhere to make her slanderous video more plausible. That was the only explanation, right?
I asked Remem to examine the video’s watermark, and it reported the video was unmodified. I saw that Remem had suggested a correction in my search terms: where I had said "the time Nicole yelled at me," it offered "the time I yelled at Nicole." The correction must have been displayed at the same time as the initial search result, but I hadn’t noticed. I shut down Remem in disgust, furious at the product. I was about to search for information on forging a digital watermark to prove this video was faked, but I stopped myself, recognizing it as an act of desperation.
I would have testified, hand on a stack of Bibles or using any oath required of me, that it was Nicole who’d accused me of being the reason her mother left us. My recollection of that argument was as clear as any memory I had, but that wasn’t the only reason I found the video hard to believe; it was also my knowledge that—whatever my faults or imperfections—I was never the kind of father who could say such a thing to his child.
Yet here was digital video proving that I had been exactly that kind of father. And while I wasn’t that man anymore, I couldn’t deny that I was continuous with him.
Even more telling was the fact that for many years I had successfully hidden the truth from myself. Earlier I said that the details we choose to remember are a reflection of our personalities. What did it say about me that I put those words in Nicole’s mouth instead of mine?
I remembered that argument as being a turning point for me. I had imagined a narrative of redemption and self-improvement in which I was the heroic single father, rising to meet the challenge. But the reality was…what? How much of what had happened since then could I take credit for?
I restarted Remem and began looking at video of Nicole’s graduation from college. That was an event I had recorded myself, so I had footage of Nicole’s face, and she seemed genuinely happy in my presence. Was she hiding her true feelings so well that I couldn’t detect them? Or, if our relationship had actually improved, how had that happened? I had obviously been a much worse father fourteen years ago than I’d thought; it would be tempting to conclude I had come farther to reach where I currently was, but I couldn’t trust my perceptions anymore. Did Nicole even have positive feelings about me now?

I wasn’t going to try using Remem to answer this question; I needed to go to the source. I called Nicole and left a message saying I wanted to talk to her, and asking if I could come over to her apartment that evening.

It was a few years later that Sabe began attending a series of meetings of all the chiefs in the Shangev clan. He explained to Jijingi that the Europeans no longer wished to deal with so many chiefs, and were demanding that all of Tivland be divided into eight groups they called ‘septs.’ As a result, Sabe and the other chiefs had to discuss who the Shangev clan would join with. Although there was no need for a scribe, Jijingi was curious to hear the deliberations and asked Sabe if he might accompany him, and Sabe agreed.
Jijingi had never seen so many elders in one place before; some were even-tempered and dignified like Sabe, while others were loud and full of bluster. They argued for hours on end.
In the evening after Jijingi had returned, Moseby asked him what it had been like. Jijingi sighed. "Even if they’re not yelling, they’re fighting like wildcats."
"Who does Sabe think you should join?"
"We should join with the clans that we’re most closely related to; that’s the Tiv way. And since Shangev was the son of Kwande, our clan should join with the Kwande clan, who live to the south."
"That makes sense," said Moseby. "So why is there disagreement?"
"The members of the Shangev clan don’t all live next to each other. Some live on the farmland in the west, near the Jechira clan, and the elders there are friendly with the Jechira elders. They’d like the Shangev clan to join the Jechira clan, because then they’d have more influence in the resulting sept."
"I see." Moseby thought for a moment. "Could the western Shangev join a different sept from the southern Shangev?"
Jijingi shook his head. "We Shangev all have one father, so we should all remain together. All the elders agree on that."
"But if lineage is so important, how can the elders from the west argue that the Shangev clan ought to join with the Jechira clan?"
"That’s what the disagreement was about. The elders from the west are claiming Shangev was the son of Jechira."
"Wait, you don’t know who Shangev’s parents were?"
"Of course we know! Sabe can recite his ancestors all the way back to Tiv himself. The elders from the west are merely pretending that Shangev was Jechira’s son because they’d benefit from joining with the Jechira clan."
"But if the Shangev clan joined with the Kwande clan, wouldn’t your elders benefit?"
"Yes, but Shangev was Kwande’s son." Then Jijingi realized what Moseby was implying. "You think our elders are the ones pretending!"
"No, not at all. It just sounds like both sides have equally good claims, and there’s no way to tell who’s right."
"Sabe’s right."
"Of course," said Moseby. "But how can you get the others to admit that? In the land I come from, many people write down their lineage on paper. That way we can trace our ancestry precisely, even many generations in the past."
"Yes, I’ve seen the lineages in your Bible, tracing Abraham back to Adam."
"Of course. But even apart from the Bible, people have recorded their lineages. When people want to find out who they’re descended from, they can consult paper. If you had paper, the other elders would have to admit that Sabe was right."
That was a good point, Jijingi admitted. If only the Shangev clan had been using paper long ago. Then something occurred to him. "How long ago did the Europeans first come to Tivland?"
"I’m not sure. At least forty years ago, I think."
"Do you think they might have written down anything about the Shangev clan’s lineage when they first arrived?"
Moseby looked thoughtful. "Perhaps. The administration definitely keeps a lot of records. If there are any, they’d be stored at the government station in Katsina-Ala."

A truck carried goods along the motor road into Katsina-Ala every fifth day, when the market was being held, and the next market would be the day after tomorrow. If he left tomorrow morning, he could reach the motor road in time to get a ride. "Do you think they would let me see them?"

"It might be easier if you have a European with you," said Moseby, smiling. "Shall we take a trip?"

Nicole opened the door to her apartment and invited me in. She was obviously curious about why I’d come. "So what did you want to talk about?"
I wasn’t sure how to begin. "This is going to sound strange."
"Okay," she said.
I told her about viewing my partial lifelog using Remem, and seeing the argument we’d had when she was sixteen that ended with me yelling at her and her leaving the house. "Do you remember that day?"
"Of course I do." She looked uncomfortable, uncertain of where I was going with this.
"I remembered it too, or at least I thought I did. But I remembered it differently. The way I remembered it, it was you who said it to me."
"Me who said what?"
"I remembered you telling me that I could leave for all you cared, and that you’d be better off without me."
Nicole stared at me for a long time. "All these years, that’s how you’ve remembered that day?"
"Yes, until today."
"That’d almost be funny if it weren’t so sad."
I felt sick to my stomach. "I’m so sorry. I can’t tell you how sorry I am."
"Sorry you said it, or sorry that you imagined me saying it?"
"Both."
"Well you should be! You know how that made me feel?"
"I can’t imagine. I know I felt terrible when I thought you had said it to me."
"Except that was just something you made up. It actually happened to me." She shook her head in disbelief. "Fucking typical."
That hurt to hear. "Is it? Really?"
"Sure," she said. "You’re always acting like you’re the victim, like you’re the good guy who deserves to be treated better than you are."
"You make me sound like I’m delusional."
"Not delusional. Just blind and self-absorbed."
I bristled a little. "I’m trying to apologize here."
"Right, right. This is about you."
"No, you’re right, I’m sorry." I waited until Nicole gestured for me to go on. "I guess I am…blind and self-absorbed. The reason it’s hard for me to admit that is that I thought I had opened my eyes and gotten over that."
She frowned. "What?"
I told her how I felt like I had turned around as a father and rebuilt our relationship, culminating in a moment of bonding at her college graduation. Nicole wasn’t openly derisive, but her expression caused me to stop talking; it was obvious I was embarrassing myself.
"Did you still hate me at graduation?" I asked. "Was I completely making it up that you and I got along then?"
"No, we did get along at graduation. But it wasn’t because you had magically become a good father."
"What was it, then?"
She paused, took a deep breath, and then said, "I started seeing a therapist when I went to college." She paused again. "She pretty much saved my life."
My first thought was, why would Nicole need a therapist? I pushed that down and said, "I didn’t know you were in therapy."
"Of course you didn’t; you were the last person I would have told. Anyway, by the time I was a senior, she had convinced me that I was better off not staying angry at you. That’s why you and I got along so well at graduation."
So I had indeed fabricated a narrative that bore little resemblance to reality. Nicole had done all the work, and I had done none.
"I guess I don’t really know you."
She shrugged. "You know me as well as you need to."
That hurt, too, but I could hardly complain. "You deserve better," I said.
Nicole gave a brief, rueful laugh. "You know, when I was younger, I used to daydream about you saying that. But now…well, it’s not as if it fixes everything, is it?"
I realized that I’d been hoping she would forgive me then and there, and then everything would be good. But it would take more than my saying sorry to repair our relationship.
Something occurred to me. "I can’t change the things I did, but at least I can stop pretending I didn’t do them. I’m going to use Remem to get a honest picture at myself, take a kind of personal inventory."
Nicole looked at me, gauging my sincerity. "Fine," she said. "But let’s be clear: you don’t come running to me every time you feel guilty over treating me like crap. I worked hard to put that behind me, and I’m not going to relive it just so you can feel better about yourself."
"Of course." I saw that she was tearing up. "And I’ve upset you again by bringing all this up. I’m sorry."
"It’s all right, Dad. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. Just…let’s not do it again for a while, okay?"
"Right." I moved toward the door to leave, and then stopped. "I just wanted to ask…if it’s possible, if there’s anything I can do to make amends…"
"Make amends?" She looked incredulous. "I don’t know. Just be more considerate, will you?"

And that what I’m trying to do.

At the government station there was indeed paper from forty years ago, what the Europeans called "assessment reports," and Moseby’s presence was sufficient to grant them access. They were written in the European language, which Jijingi couldn’t read, but they included diagrams of the ancestry of the various clans, and he could identify the Tiv names in those diagrams easily enough, and Moseby had confirmed that his interpretation was correct. The elders in the western farms were right, and Sabe was wrong: Shangev was not Kwande’s son, he was Jechira’s.
One of the men at the government station had agreed to type up a copy of the relevant page so Jijingi could take it with him. Moseby decided to stay in Katsina-Ala to visit with the missionaries there, but Jijingi came home right away. He felt like an impatient child on the return trip, wishing he could ride the truck all the way back instead of having to walk from the motor road. As soon as he had arrived at the village, Jijingi looked for Sabe.
He found him on the path leading to a neighboring farm; some neighbors had stopped Sabe to have him settle a dispute over how a nanny goat’s kids should be distributed. Finally, they were satisfied, and Sabe resumed his walk. Jijingi walked beside him.
"Welcome back," said Sabe.
"Sabe, I’ve been to Katsina-Ala."
"Ah. Why did you go there?"
Jijingi showed him the paper. "This was written long ago, when the Europeans first came here. They spoke to the elders of the Shangev clan then, and when the elders told them the history of the Shangev clan, they said that Shangev was the son of Jechira."
Sabe’s reaction was mild. "Whom did the Europeans ask?"
Jijingi looked at the paper. "Batur and Iorkyaha."
"I remember them," he said, nodding. "They were wise men. They would not have said such a thing."
Jijingi pointed at the words on the page. "But they did!"
"Perhaps you are reading it wrong."
"I am not! I know how to read."
Sabe shrugged. "Why did you bring this paper back here?"
"What it says is important. It means we should rightfully be joined with the Jechira clan."
"You think the clan should trust your decision on this matter?"
"I’m not asking the clan to trust me. I’m asking them to trust the men who were elders when you were young."
"And so they should. But those men aren’t here. All you have is paper."
"The paper tells us what they would say if they were here."
"Does it? A man doesn’t speak only one thing. If Batur and Iorkyaha were here, they would agree with me that we should join with the Kwande clan."
"How could they, when Shangev was the son of Jechira?" He pointed at the sheet of paper. "The Jechira are our closer kin."
Sabe stopped walking and turned to face Jijingi. "Questions of kinship cannot be resolved by paper. You’re a scribe because Maisho of the Kwande clan warned me about the boys from the mission school. Maisho wouldn’t have looked out for us if we didn’t share the same father. Your position is proof of how close our clans are, but you forget that. You look to paper to tell you what you should already know, here." Sabe tapped him on his chest. "Have you studied paper so much that you’ve forgotten what it is to be Tiv?"
Jijingi opened his mouth to protest when he realized that Sabe was right. All the time he’d spent studying writing had made him think like a European. He had come to trust what was written on paper over what was said by people, and that wasn’t the Tiv way.
The assessment report of the Europeans was vough; it was exact and precise, but that wasn’t enough to settle the question. The choice of which clan to join with had to be right for the community; it had to be mimi. Only the elders could determine what was mimi; it was their responsibility to decide what was best for the Shangev clan. Asking Sabe to defer to the paper was asking him to act against what he considered right.
"You’re right, Sabe," he said. "Forgive me. You’re my elder, and it was wrong of me to suggest that paper could know more than you."
Sabe nodded and resumed walking. "You are free to do as you wish, but I believe it will do more harm than good to show that paper to others."
Jijingi considered it. The elders from the western farms would undoubtedly argue that the assessment report supported their position, prolonging a debate that had already gone too long. But more than that, it would move the Tiv down the path of regarding paper as the source of truth; it would be another stream in which the old ways were washing away, and he could see no benefit in it.
"I agree," said Jijingi. "I won’t show this to anyone else."
Sabe nodded.
Jijingi walked back to his hut, reflecting on what had happened. Even without attending a mission school, he had begun thinking like a European; his practice of writing in his notebooks had led him to disrespect his elders without him even being aware of it. Writing helped him think more clearly, he couldn’t deny that; but that wasn’t good enough reason to trust paper over people.

As a scribe, he had to keep the book of Sabe’s decisions in tribal court. But he didn’t need to keep the other notebooks, the ones in which he’d written down his thoughts. He would use them as tinder for the cooking fire.

We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.
Before a culture adopts the use of writing, when its knowledge is transmitted exclusively through oral means, it can very easily revise its history. It’s not intentional, but it is inevitable; throughout the world, bards and griots have adapted their material to their audiences, and thus gradually adjusted the past to suit the needs of the present. The idea that accounts of the past shouldn’t change is a product of literate cultures’ reverence for the written word. Anthropologists will tell you that oral cultures understand the past differently; for them, their histories don’t need to be accurate so much as they need to validate the community’s understanding of itself. So it wouldn’t be correct to say that their histories are unreliable; their histories do what they need to do.
Right now each of us is a private oral culture. We rewrite our pasts to suit our needs and support the story we tell about ourselves. With our memories we are all guilty of a Whig interpretation of our personal histories, seeing our former selves as steps toward our glorious present selves.
But that era is coming to an end. Remem is merely the first of a new generation of memory prostheses, and as these products gain widespread adoption, we will be replacing our malleable organic memories with perfect digital archives. We will have a record of what we actually did instead of stories that evolve over repeated tellings. Within our minds, each of us will be transformed from an oral culture into a literate one.
It would be easy for me to assert that literate cultures are better off than oral ones, but my bias should be obvious, since I’m writing these words rather than speaking them to you. Instead I will say that it’s easier for me to appreciate the benefits of literacy and harder to recognize everything it has cost us. Literacy encourages a culture to place more value on documentation and less on subjective experience, and overall I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Written records are subject to every kind of error and their interpretation is subject to change, but at least the words on the page remain fixed, and there is real merit in that.
When it comes to our individual memories, I live on the opposite side of the divide. As someone whose identity was built on organic memory, I’m threatened by the prospect of removing subjectivity from our recall of events. I used to think it could be valuable for individuals to tell stories about themselves, valuable in a way that it couldn’t be for cultures, but I’m a product of my time, and times change. We can’t prevent the adoption of digital memory any more than oral cultures could stop the arrival of literacy, so the best I can do is look for something positive in it.
And I think I’ve found the real benefit of digital memory. The point is not to prove you were right; the point is to admit you were wrong.
Because all of us have been wrong on various occasions, engaged in cruelty and hypocrisy, and we’ve forgotten most of those occasions. And that means we don’t really know ourselves. How much personal insight can I claim if I can’t trust my memory? How much can you? You’re probably thinking that, while your memory isn’t perfect, you’ve never engaged in revisionism of the magnitude I’m guilty of. But I was just as certain as you, and I was wrong. You may say, "I know I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes." I am here to tell you that you have made more than you think, that some of the core assumptions on which your self-image is built are actually lies. Spend some time using Remem, and you’ll find out.
But the reason I now recommend Remem is not for the shameful reminders it provides of your past; it’s to avoid the need for those in the future. Organic memory was what enabled me to construct a whitewashed narrative of my parenting skills, but by using digital memory from now on, I hope to keep that from happening. The truth about my behavior won’t be presented to me by someone else, making me defensive; it won’t even be something I’ll discover as a private shock, prompting a reevaluation. With Remem providing only the unvarnished facts, my image of myself will never stray too far from the truth in the first place.
Digital memory will not stop us from telling stories about ourselves. As I said earlier, we are made of stories, and nothing can change that. What digital memory will do is change those stories from fabulations that emphasize our best acts and elide our worst, into ones that—I hope—acknowledge our fallibility and make us less judgmental about the fallibility of others.
Nicole has begun using Remem as well, and discovered that her recollection of events isn’t perfect either. This hasn’t made her forgive me for the way I treated her—nor should it, because her misdeeds were minor compared to mine—but it has softened her anger at my misremembering my actions, because she realizes it’s something we all do. And I’m embarrassed to admit that this is precisely the scenario Erica Meyers predicted when she talked about Remem’s effects on relationships.

This doesn’t mean I’ve changed my mind about the downsides of digital memory; there are many, and people need to be aware of them. I just don’t think I can argue the case with any sort of objectivity anymore. I abandoned the article I was planning to write about memory prostheses; I handed off the research I’d done to a colleague, and she wrote a fine piece about the pros and cons of the software, a dispassionate article free from all the soul-searching and angst that would have saturated anything I submitted. Instead, I’ve written this.

The account I’ve given of the Tiv is based in fact, but isn’t precisely accurate. There was indeed a dispute among the Tiv in 1941 over whom the Shangev clan should join with, based on differing claims about the parentage of the clan’s founder, and administrative records did show that the clan elders’ account of their genealogy had changed over time. But many of the specific details I’ve described are invented. The actual events were more complicated and less dramatic, as actual events always are, so I have taken liberties to make a better narrative. I’ve told a story in order to make a case for the truth. I recognize the contradiction here.
As for my account of my argument with Nicole, I’ve tried to make it as accurate as I possibly could. I’ve been recording everything since I started working on this project, and I’ve consulted the recordings repeatedly when writing this. But in my choice of which details to include and which to omit, perhaps I have just constructed another story. In spite of my efforts to be unflinching, have I flattered myself with this portrayal? Have I distorted events so they more closely follow the arc expected of a confessional narrative? The only way you can judge is by comparing my account against the recordings themselves, so I’m doing something I never thought I’d do: with Nicole’s permission, I am granting public access to my lifelog, such as it is. Take a look at the video, and decide for yourself.
And if you think I’ve been less than honest, tell me. I want to know.#arthist164a

 The road to hell is paved with asphalt

                  The road to hell is paved with asphalt
                  

January 15th, 2024
Most roads are paved with asphalt. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with asphalt. Bricks, cobblestones, and pavers are often much better options, because:
1.  Asphalt degrades fast, so once you account for maintenance, it's more expensive it first appearsAsphalt ages and falls apart quickly. It needs to be replaced after 10-15 years and starts looking pretty crummy well before then. It forms potholes and cracks quickly, especially in extreme climates. It's cheaper to install upfront, but over time, it is much more expensive.Meanwhile, brick and cobblestone roads can last 150 years or more – in fact the cobblestones still in use in Rome's Appian Way are over 2,000 years old! These materials don't need much maintenance, and if a single brick does crack, that individual piece can be replaced easily.Asphalt does not age well...Built during the Roman Empire, the Appian Way is still in use today.2.  Asphalt is expensive to change, and it scars tooWhenever a construction crew needs to do underground work beneath an asphalt road, they have to rip up all of the asphalt and then patch it back up afterwards – and it's never as smooth as it previously was. This adds cost and time to any road project, which usually isn't taken into account when the road is originally constructed. If they were, asphalt wouldn't look like such a cheap option.With materials like brick or cobblestone, crews can easily lift individual stones to access below, then replace them once finished. "When the construction crews complete their underground work, the gravel bedding layer can be re-compacted and the original pavers reset," explains Preservation Chicago. "It is often impossible to see where the pavers were disturbed."Every change in the infrastructure underneath your street will be visible as a scar marring the asphaltIt's much less invasive to pull up modular materials and then put them back again.3.  Asphalt absorbs heatAsphalt absorbs a lot of heat. On hot days, asphalt can be 25℉ warmer than other surfaces nearby! 

Asphalt doesn't just make it less pleasant to walk on top of them on a hot day – it also heats up nearby buildings as well, increasing energy demands for AC.

Pavers tend to do better in hot weather because the gaps between each piece allow for a small amount of airflow, releasing heat more easily. This higher ratio of surface area to volume makes a big difference.

That said, not all pavers are created equal. Lighter colored bricks stay much cooler than denser concrete or terra cotta pavers. Within cobblestones, smoothed limestone reflects more sunlight and heats up less efficiently than trap rock or river rock. And among slabs, light-hued granite withstands warming better than slate or bluestone which can get quite hot in full sun. Porosity also plays a role, with perforated Belgian blocks transferring heat faster than permeable limestone.On the plus side, you won't need a frying pan – you can just cook an egg right on the road!Pavers can be explicitly designed to reduce the heat island effect in hot environments.4. Asphalt cracks in the coldAsphalt gets hard and brittle in the cold. This makes it harder for asphalt to handle the stress from cars driving over it. Asphalt also shrinks in the cold, adding to the stress. This results in cracks in the surface, allowing water in. Water expands when it freezes, compounding the damage. Asphalt is a particularly bad choice for places with freezing winters.Modular surfaces handle cold weather better, because they are made up of many smaller pieces that can move slightly when the ground freezes and thaws. This movement helps prevent cracking. Avoiding cracking means that water is less likely to get into the material in the first place, which prevents the worst of the damage.
5.  Asphalt is uglyAsphalt isn't very attractive, even when it's fresh, and it only gets uglier over time. It may be cheaper upfront than other surfacing materials, but the cost-cutting shows. Choosing a cheap material sends a signal that this is a lower priority space than other parts of a community.Alternative materials give streets more charm. Unlike asphalt, they actually become more lovely as they age – over time, they develop even more personality as moss or lichen finds nooks to take hold. Plus, they're more likely to be made of local materials.Where would you rather take your wedding photos?6. Asphalt has nasty emissionsAsphalt releases harmful emissions like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter when it's produced and laid down. These emissions contribute to air pollution, which can lead to breathing problems and environmental issues like smog and acid rain. Making asphalt also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.The process to make concrete or brick pavers typically releases less VOCs and particulates. Since installing pavers doesn't need as much heat, it uses less energy and results in lower carbon dioxide emissions. This makes pavers a more environmentally friendly option in terms of air quality and reducing greenhouse gases.7.  Asphalt has bad drainage 
Asphalt is an impervious membrane that sheds water rather than allowing it to permeate into the ground. Even shallow puddles can linger for prolonged periods on asphalt. This contributes significantly to flooding issues, as the water has nowhere to go but overflow curbs and accumulate elsewhere.
These drainage problems are exacerbated by asphalt's tendency to crack and form pitted potholes over time. Instead of shedding water evenly, cracked roads effectively funnel moisture directly into the ground below at an unnaturally rapid rate.Pavers are made to slowly absorb rainwater. Their interlocking design includes small gaps between each unit that allow rainfall to seep into the ground below instead of gathering on top. This helps drainage happen like nature intended, reducing and slowing down lots of runoff. Rather than overwhelming drains and sewers, the moisture gets safely absorbed through the porous system.

Different modular materials have different levels of porousness, but they almost all have better drainage performance than asphalt.
This is not to say that asphalt is always the wrong material. It sets quickly, it's easy to repair, and it's cheaper upfront – it's a great tool to have in the toolbox, especially for regions with moderate climates. But 93% of roads are paved with asphalt! I simply think that it's way overused, and on the margin we should look to other materials, especially residential and side streets.

The road to asphalt is paved with incentives
Given all of the downsides of asphalt, you might ask "why is asphalt so pervasive if there are better options out there?" A lot of it comes down to cashflow. Cashflow is one of the biggest challenges in real estate development, since – it's a business where you invest a lot of money upfront and then earn it back over time afterwards. 
Developers are often motivated by short-term incentives when choosing materials for construction projects. They need to manage immediate expenses and ensure the project is completed within budget.

Moreover, when a developer builds a project to sell rather than to rent long-term, their responsibility ends once the units are sold. This means they aren't directly affected by the long-term maintenance costs. Similarly, city officials elected for specific terms might prioritize immediate cost savings over long-term expenses. They are more likely to get reelected for lowering the city's expenses this year than for lowering its long-term liabilities, which only show up decades later.

By contrast, if developers retain long-term responsibility for their projects—such as by renting out units instead of selling them outright—they would have a direct interest in reducing long-term maintenance costs. This change could encourage the use of more durable, cost-effective materials in the long run, benefiting both the developer and the tenants. The dynamic of rentals results in a win-win scenario, with lower long-term expenses for the developer and improved quality of life for the tenants. (If you're interested in learning more about why a developer might choose to rent or sell a project, here's a post that dives into that topic.)

Design tradeoffs of bricks, cobbles, & pavers
Modular materials have design tradeoffs too, of course. One common downside is that they can be bumpy to bike on. However it is possible to find options that give a smooth ride, if you look for it. Here are two examples I've seen in person:Alys Beach uses a lovely material called Belgian Cobble that creates a fairly even surface while still having all of the other benefits of modular materials, too, including a very high permeabilityCuldesac Tempe uses pavers packed carefully with a tight enough tolerance so that the surface is smooth to bike on.

Modular materials also tend to reduce traffic speeds, since the create a surface that is not as seamless as fresh asphalt or concrete. In one brick installation project, the average speed dropped from 41 mph to 29 mph. This represents 30% decrease in speed, and the risk of death when a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle is approximately 4x higher at 40 mph versus at 30 mph.

Of course whether this reduction in speed is a good thing or bad thing just depends on the context in which you're using it. It's great for residential side streets and commercial shopping streets, because you don't want cars racing around those places anyways. However on major arterials and highways, it wouldn't work so well, because the purpose of those roads is to move people as quickly as possible.

~  ~  ~

We need to stop planning project primarily by spreadsheets, where the dominating inputs are costs you can measure easily. There are factors that are not reflected in those calculations that not only affect the quality of the place you're creating, but also the financial burden that the community will have to bear for decades down the line.

 Uncharted waters: what startups can learn from pirates about compensation
                  Uncharted waters: what startups can learn from pirates about compensation
                  

September 10th, 2022
Pirate crews developed a surprisingly similar approach to compensation in the 17th century. Just like many startups, they also balanced equity incentives with other mechanisms that would be familiar to a startup employee today, such as bonuses.

These surprising similarities offer an interesting frame through which we can reflect on why startup equity and bonuses are structured the way they are. We can learn a lot about the theory of compensation in modern companies by looking at how pirates designed incentives to organize and motivate their work.

It’s called "venture" capital for a reason

Pirates offered their crew members equal shares of their loot, similar to how many startups offer employees equity in the business. In this way, 17th-century pirates and modern-day startups are more similar to each other than to law-abiding ships or established companies, the most common alternative employment options in their respective eras.

In the Golden Age of Piracy (late 1600s-early 1700s), it was incredibly rare for law-abiding workers to own a share of a business. Piracy offered one of the few avenues for a normal person to have a chance for great riches and autonomy over their work. Merchant ships and royal navies were the two main alternatives to piracy for employment for sailors, neither of which had any sort of equity-based compensation. They paid flat wages on a per-voyage basis, which meant that no sailors got rich from working on a merchant or navy ship.

This has persisted through the centuries. To this day, employee ownership still isn’t the norm outside of startups. Just 22% of Americans who work for a for-profit company report that they own any shares of stock in the company. Meanwhile, it’s common practice for a startup to give equity, and it’s a crucial part of the compensation package to attract talent. Many potential employees won’t even consider working for an early startup that doesn’t offer equity. For example, multiple people in this Hacker News thread state that they wouldn’t accept a job from an employer like Mailchimp that doesn’t offer equity compensation, and a former Mailchimp employee cited lack of equity as the "largest factor" in their move.

The crucial similarity between startups and pirates—which they don’t share with most modern companies or with 17th-century merchant ships—is that the teammates themselves are essentially acting as investors, rather than just as employees. Pirates had no base wage and only made money if they captured another ship; meanwhile, early startup employees generally take a pay cut in the short term in return for a stake in the company. In both cases, the teammates are essentially investing their own time into the company at a discount in exchange for potential upside in the future value they are part of creating.

By contrast, merchant ships and the navy paid low but steady wages. The average law-abiding sailor’s wage was "about $4,000 to $8,800 in current U.S. dollars," according to Peter T. Leeson. Although these wages were low, it was much less risky than getting paid purely based on a "you eat what you kill" policy. Similarly, many modern workers choose to work for a big company that pays a steady salary instead of a startup where their equity might be worth millions—or might be worthless—down the line.

Although pirates and startup employees both venture into uncharted waters, the risks that pirates faced were of course far greater than anything most startup employees face today.

In startups, the biggest risk is that your equity might be worthless. A pirate might die, lose a limb, or go to prison for life.

Despite these differences, the essential structure of the risk-reward tradeoff that sailors faced when considering piracy was similar to the choice that modern workers face when deciding between a startup or an established company. The potential for massive upside attracts ambitious, risk-tolerant people to startups today similar to how it attracted them to pirate ships in the 17th century. Luckily, these days there are better employment alternatives than the merchant marine, the royal navy, and piracy!

Treasure for me but not for thee

One of the key challenges that both startups and pirate ships face is that it’s difficult to control (or even measure) how productive a particular teammate is day by day. When management can’t guarantee that you’ll operate for the benefit of the team’s broader goals, they need to design incentives so that you’ll do what’s right for the team even when no one is watching.

That said, the reason it’s difficult to control or measure a startup employee’s productivity is different from why it’s difficult to do so for a pirate. In a tech company, most employees are doing "knowledge work". Much of the hard work happens inside of someone’s head, where you can’t see it. When a knowledge worker produces output, it can be almost as much effort to verify that it was done well as it was to produce it in the first place.

Pirate ships have a different challenge with maintaining discipline and quality control: a collective action problem. The most crucial moments that defined a pirate ship’s success were when they attacked another ship to capture their treasure. These are also one of the most dangerous moments, because there is physical violence involved. If you’re a pirate, you want to see your crew successfully capture a merchant ship because it’ll make you rich, but you also want to avoid violence because… well, you might die before you get to see any of that treasure. The resulting incentive is to hold back and let your comrades board the victim ship before you, so that you can get the benefits without the costs. However if all of the pirates do that, the raid is much more likely to fail.

The way pirates solved this problem was similar to how startup compensation works today—although luckily the stakes aren’t so high in a modern Delaware C-corp. Before each journey, pirates would create a written constitution that laid out the base compensation for each crew member, as well as bonuses for especially brave actions. Alexander Exquemelin, a 17th century French pirate surgeon who wrote The History of the Buccaneers of America, described one excerpt of the articles of agreement that governed his ship: "For the loss of a right arm, 600 pieces of eight… for a left arm 500 pieces of eight... If a man lost the use of an arm, he would get as much as if it had been cut off, and a severe internal injury which meant the victim had to have a pipe inserted in his body would receive 500 pieces of eight […] in recompense."

In The Invisible Hook, Peter T. Leesen describes, "To further encourage full effort, pirate articles contained incentive provisions that paid bonuses to crew members who displayed exceptional courage in battle, were the first to spot potential targets, and so forth, out of the common purse… According to section VIII of Ned Low’s crew’s articles, "He that sees a sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her." These incentive provisions must have worked well since, as Johnson noted, "It must be observed, they [pirates] keep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who first espies a Sail, if she proves a Prize, is entitled the best Pair of Pistols on board, over and above his Dividend."

The typical startup compensation structure has many similarities with that of a pirate ship, though luckily startup employees are generally not risking life or limb when they join a high-growth company. When an employee has had an exceptional year and goes above and beyond their standard duties, their manager will often award them a cash or stock bonus, significantly increasing their overall compensation.

Bonuses are important to both startup and pirate compensation structures, because they counteract the "rising tides lift all boats" effect that company equity and equally splitting booty both create. While equity and equal shares of booty align individuals with the goals of the overall team, they also allow for free-riders to benefit from the work of others without having to do anything on their own, once they’ve joined the team.

The motivational effect of bonuses shows up in the data too. An analysis from the Yale School of Management studied how sales teams respond to bonus-based compensations plan, and they found that "bonuses enhance productivity [and] overachievement commissions help sustain the high productivity of the best performers even after attaining quotas".

Bonuses also disaggregate individual impact over time, compared to equity whose value is determined by the aggregate impact of the whole team. Recent research from the Stanford Graduate School of Business illustrates this effect. The researchers studied data between 2006-2017 for over 1,400 public companies. "They found that tying bonus-related performance to non-bottom-line financials largely helped address issues related to timing: that is, the time lag between when an executive makes an investment in the business’s future and when that investment pays off. If there’s a timing mismatch, boards will sometimes disregard costs of certain investments when calculating bonuses — as a way to encourage investments in projects worth pursuing, especially the kind that are designed to promote long-term growth."

Whether it’s for exceeding a KPI or being the first to board a merchant ship, performance-based bonuses incentivize team members to carry their weight and take initiative rather than depending on the enthusiasm or past successes of their coworkers.


Pirates are a fascinating comparison point for modern startups. If you look closely at how pirates worked together, it’s easy to recognize organizational structures that are alive and well in modern startups.

Although the day-to-day work of a sea bandit couldn’t be more different than that of a frontend engineer at a SaaS startup, the risk-reward tradeoff is very similar. Putting that tradeoff in visceral terms can be a fun way to make it more concrete and intuitive when venturing into uncharted waters.

 Topographic theory of flaking


                  Topographic theory of flaking
                  

August 16th, 2020
Natan Gesher sent me the following email after reading my post about why flaking is so widespread in San Francisco, and I thought you all might find it interesting too:

I saw your blog posts about flaking and wanted to share something I've observed from moving around a bit (four years in Manhattan for university, then two years in Jerusalem, five years in Tel Aviv, two years in San Francisco, three and a half years in Manhattan, one year in Seattle and finally the past two+ years in Manhattan): topography seems to have an effect on how people meet each other, make friends and form friend groups.Specifically, in cities with a lot of hills (in my experience Jerusalem, San Francisco and Seattle), neighborhood identities tend to be stronger, it's more difficult to meet new people who don't live in one's own neighborhood and therefore it becomes more important to move to the neighborhood that matches the identity one has (or wants), and friend networks within neighborhoods tend to be more stable. This could be considered "cliquey."In flat cities (in my experience, Manhattan x3 and Tel Aviv), however, neighborhoods are more fluid, it's easier to meet new people from every neighborhood in any neighborhood and therefore it becomes less important to live in a specific neighborhood than to be within strategic commuting distance of everywhere / wherever interesting things are happening, and friend networks turn over more rapidly. This could be considered "transient."I've hypothesized that hills within a city may impose a certain psychological barrier - despite the physical barriers that are so easy to overcome with modern forms of transportation - preventing people from wanting to transcend them, and that neighborhood cultures in hilly cities persist longer over decades and absorb new members more thoroughly.For me, living in the lower Haight was the only time in my life that I seriously considered buying an automobile of any kind, a Vespa scooter. In retrospect, though it would have helped my commute, I don't think it would have made any difference for me socially, because the barrier that the hills represent is cultural and psychological, not really geographical. 

Dan Wang and Brian Lui also had some interesting reflections on that same post, which you can find here.#cities

                  Field notes: Miami
                  

April 21st, 2021
Update 5-Dec-2021: Read the updated version of these notes here.

These field notes are a bit different from previous cities I've explored, because unlike those, Miami is my home! So this post partially serves as a life update—I moved to Miami Beach from California a few months ago, and I'm excited to share my explorations with you.
What makes Miami special – A few things that stand out to me about Miami.Expectation vs reality – Miami is not just the set of Spring Breakers.Neighborhoods – A quick lay of the land of the neighborhoods I've explored so far.FAQs – Questions I'm often asked.My questions – Questions I have about Miami. Let me know if you have answers!

# I. What makes Miami specialThe colors! Everything is more colorful than it needs to be. Everything from high-rises to the clothing people wear to the lifeguard towers are in bright neon and pastels, and the city is overflowing with flowers.Why paint the building one color when you could paint it ALL the colors?
Immigrant spirit: This is going to sound cheesy, but it's how I feel so I'm going to say it—Miami embodies America's immigrant spirit more than any other major city I've been to.
58% of the city is foreign born, but more than that, when you talk to people in the street or in cafes there's this palpable sense that they made an active choice to be here because they thought it would create opportunities for themselves and their children to lead better lives. In a lot of cases, these are people who risked a lot to make that choice, and they've come here because they believe in American principles and the way we do things (or at least what we strive for).
Don't get me wrong, America has a lot of problems, but spending time with the people here who've left Cuba or Venezuela or Haiti or some other part of the world to make the USA their home is a reminder of what makes America special. There's nothing like spending time with immigrants to make you proud of your country.
Oh so flamboyant: Paul Graham talks about how cities whisper different things into your ear, and Miami's whisper is very, very different from SF and NYC (the two cities I'm most familiar with). SF is all about having the longest lever* on an important problem that you can get. NYC whispers lots of different things depending on what circles you're in, but the whisper I personally hear from NYC is that I should be more cool and interesting.
Miami seems to whisper to people that you should be entertaining and flamboyant. This takes a lot of different forms. The most visible ones are the party girls walking to the beach with stiletto heels and the macho guys revving the Lamborghinis they rented for the day. The way it's manifested for me personally is that I suddenly have a massive urge to get good at rollerskating so that I can bop around the Miami Beach boardwalk with all of the other people wearing brightly colored skates dancing to bubblegum pop music.
* Paul describes this as "power", but I like the lever analogy more because it emphasizes the technological aspects of it. Power is too broad—it can include coercion, and that's frowned upon in SF, but gaining power through smarts and invention is celebrated.
↓ She's heading to the beach. Meanwhile I can barely stand up straight in heels, let alone walk in sand with them.
I just want to have this much fun

Street conversations: Miamians talk to you on the street casually, just like we're all friends hanging out and enjoying life side by side. This is not the norm in SF so it's taken some getting used to, but I love it.
In SF, I quickly learned that if a stranger approaches you on the street you should be careful—this is partially because it's not part of the culture for normal people to talk to you on the street, and partially because there is a lot of homelessness and crime and so talking to strangers on the street is a bit unsafe. (My default is to be really chatty with people on the street, and that has bit me in the past in SF. 😞)
In Miami by contrast, people strike up conversations with strangers all the time, even just in passing. I've had more street conversations here during a pandemic than I had in SF before Covid happened!


Endlessly entertaining: People here are just plain funny! It feels like Miami just doesn't take itself as seriously as other cities, so people are more fun and laid back. This shows up in all sorts of places, from how people dress to the names of restaurants. It also shows up in the architecture, which I'll get to in the next bullet point.
My favorite manifestation is that on the boardwalk, it's extremely common to see people running or biking by with headphones on and belting out a pop song as they zoom by you. They seem to be having an absolute blast, and they're generally very fit too. Hey, if singing Rihanna's Umbrella at the top of your lungs motivates you to exercise more, then I'm all for it!
One word for whatever this is is "shamelessness", but that has a bit too much of a negative, moralistic connotation for my liking. Many of the ridiculous activities people do here in Miami aren't quite my style, but I'm extremely happy that they exist around me because they are extremely entertaining and seem to bring joy to the people who partake in them.
Read his shirt closely. (Photo taken at Miami Airport.)Small businessmen have set up shop on the streets of Miami Beach, selling access to their pet parrots (←) and snakes (↑) so that tourists can take pictures with them.
At the beach a few weeks ago, a group of women near me was taking selfies for about 10 minutes straight. Then, one of the excitedly looked at the others and said "Butts? Butts!", and the whole group of girls flipped around and started taking pictures of their butts. It may have been the funniest thing I'd ever seen and I've been quoting it constantly since then.The next time I went to the beach, I saw another group of girls ask a separate group of guys—who I'm pretty sure they didn't know before this—to take pictures of their butts. One of the guys happily obliged. Since the photography was just a 1-man job, his friend then jumped into the picture frame and started grabbing the girls' butts as they shook them for the photo. The girls seemed to be thrilled with this and started posing even more wildly for the camera. Miami is endlessly entertaining. (Photo above)
Laissez faire: It feels like you're actually allowed to do things here. This is best illustrated by Miami's sometimes whacky architecture, but also shows up in things like Covid restrictions being lifted sooner than other major cities. This is related to #5 above, probably in a self-reinforcing loop.
It feels like the zoning is less strict here than in SF. In any given neighborhood in central Miami, you get tall buildings, short buildings, medium buildings—building heights are all over the map. Even the historically-protected Art Deco District in Miami Beach has some tall buildings. The buildings you do get are also weirder (which to me is a good thing).
This is something I want to learn more about, so please send things my way if you know more about this! Anything about Miami's zoning codes, real estate development sagas, land use economics, and so on is very welcome.
Hard Rock Hotel (above), James Hotel (below)

The Mammoth Garden at the FAENA hotel is one of the more surreal things I've seen here. I was there for dinner one night, and when trying to leave the hotel I accidentally went through the back doors rather than the front doors. I looked up in the darkness, and there was a shining gold mammoth fossil gleaming down on me. I almost didn't fully register what I was seeing for a few seconds.I vote that when Stewart Brand successfully revives the woolly mammoth, he should host its launch party in the FAENA gardens. 
Warm nights: It stays warm after dark, so you can sit outside late into the evening and still have fun. This results in a much more active street life, which is both more fun and makes it feel safer to walk around at night.


Textures: I've fallen in love with terrazzo (top) and coral stone (bottom) since I've been here. You'll find both textures everywhere in Miami once you start looking for them.Hotel hangouts: One perk of living in a vacation town is that you can hang out in gorgeous hotels for just the price of an iced tea. I've been exploring the various terraces, cafes, and pool decks within the high-end hotels along the beach and camping out at them as my office in the afternoons. They generally have great wifi, too!Culture War armistice: Over the past few years, it's become increasingly difficult to escape a certain type of confrontational, polarized politics which a lot of people call the Culture War. I have major issues with both sides of this "war", and yet I'm often faced with a "you're either with us or against us" framing from both. It's exhausting and intellectually suffocating.
Miami is a breath of fresh air. Among the people I've met here, there's a much greater level of civility and tolerance of others' viewpoints. My guess is that the diverse political viewpoints in Florida mean that Floridians have realized that (a) people who have different views aren't always immoral, stupid, or inhuman and (b) they have no choice but to find a way to live with each other, because no single political group is a clear majority in Miami.
(Caveat: I've only been here 2.5 months and it's not like I've met a random sampling of the population, so I'm sure this is not the universal experience of Miami. I'm talking only about my experience.)
Here's one illustration of what I mean: a friend who's lived in Miami for 3 years recently pointed out that he couldn't tell whether the mayor, Francis Suarez, was a Democrat or a Republican until he looked it up on his Wikipedia page. The Cuban-descended mayor is pro-immigration and pro-LGBTQ, but at the same time he's business-friendly and tough on crime. He doesn't fit cleanly into left-right binary the country has tied itself up into. It turns out that Mayor Francis Suarez is a member of the Republican party, but he's not your typical Republican by any means. (This is a description, not an endorsement.)
The fact that Miami elected someone with Suarez's background (and with 86% of the vote!) is meaningful to me—it's impossible to imagine someone like him winning a major political office in San Francisco, because his platform doesn't cleanly fit into a narrow range of acceptable viewpoints. More likely, he'd be deplatformed or booed offstage before he could even get to parts of his platform that would be popular, even though he's really quite centrist when placed on a conventional right-left US political continuum.
This isn't just about Mayor Suarez. Since WWII, Miami's mayors have alternated between Democrats and Republicans mostly evenly.
I realize that being surrounded by heterogenous political ideas isn't seen as a plus for everyone. I know lots of people who've chosen to move to places specifically because the government and culture match their values as closely as possible (e.g. a Republican moving to a conservative town or a Democrat moving to a blue county). I think that's a totally valid choice, it's just not my personal preference.Pro-business: Miami is unabashedly pro-entrepreneur and pro-business. The city government, the culture, and the tax rates are very welcoming of people who want to start and run companies. This is important to me because I believe that businesses are one of the biggest ways to create opportunities and wealth for a community (with some caveats, of course).
This business-friendly attitude seems deeply ingrained in Miami's DNA, and I have two guesses as to why:54% of the population is Cuban-descended, and they saw firsthand how Communism ruined their country's economy. They chose to come to America because it celebrates the role that business plays in society.Florida has a 0% income tax, and that attracts people who are more likely to value small government, which also correlates with being pro-business (though admittedly it also correlates with other attributes I don't value 😛).

Plants, plants everywhere! Miami is so lush. Every day I look outside my window at palm trees, birds of paradise, and bright pink blooming flowers, and I just can't get enough of it. The gorgeous tree canopy almost makes Miami's infamous heat a lot easier to bear than you might expect. Personally, I'd prefer to walk in tropical Miami under giant banyan trees in 95℉ weather than in dry Los Angeles under the direct sun.
# II. Expectation vs reality

One of my goals with these field notes is to break down misconceptions about Miami that I myself had before coming here. I'd thought that Miami was a soulless sea of glass buildings with penthouses filled with people snorting cocaine. I'd been warned that it was an extremely car-centric city with little street life, and that the humidity was so suffocating that you could barely walk from your front door to your car without breathing a sigh of relief as soon as your air conditioning began to wash over you.

These stereotypes aren't false—I'm confident you can find cocaine if you're looking for it, and that the August weather will indeed be suffocating—but they capture just a tiny sliver of what Miami is about. My experience of this city has been completely different.


Here's my slice of Miami: 
I wake up every morning with birds chirping and sunshine streaming through my window, filtered by palm trees and a massive bird of paradise just outside my window. I live in a charming 4-unit building with a cute shared courtyard, and my unit has a front yard all to its own. There's almost no street noise, so I can hear the parrots chirping as I make my morning coffee. I'm in walking distance to a gorgeous outdoor pool, a Whole Foods, the beach, dozens of cafes and restaurants, and the boardwalk. When I want to go into downtown, I take a bus that runs so often that I don't even know how long the interval is, because all I need to know is it'll show up frequently enough that I don't have to think about it.
In short, my life is filled with sunshine, walking, quiet, and easy access to transit. The stereotypes I had of Miami certainly exist, but they are not overpowering by any means.


So it might be surprising to learn that this cute little existence is right in the heart of Miami Beach. Yes, that Miami Beach. If you didn't see the recent news, Miami Beach recently rejuvenated its reputation as Spring Break capital of the world by instating an emergency curfew in response to out of control parties. (Yes, during a pandemic... 🤦‍♀️) 

This doesn't exactly square up with my peaceful, almost village-like lifestyle that I described above. The key thing is that this Spring Break sliver of Miami Beach is entirely avoidable. Ocean Drive is where most of the debauchery in Miami Beach occurs, and if you stay way from that strip then you'll be able to avoid it entirely. 

Many people associate Miami Beach with Spring Break and other drunken degeneracy because (a) they've never actually been or (b) when they visited, they primarily hung out along Ocean Drive, which is the capital of Spring Break. I personally only experience the Ocean Drive party scene when I feel in the mood for some people watching (my favorite kind of entertainment), but otherwise it doesn't intersect with my daily life much at all. It's not nearly as all-encompassing of life in Miami Beach as people assume.# III. Neighborhoods
Miami has lots of other kinds of neighborhoods as well, and the Spring Break stereotypes of Miami are even less of a match to those than to my slice of Miami Beach. Here's a sampler of the neighborhoods I've explored so far:

Brickell & Edgewater: For those gleaming towers with fancy amenities, you can live in Brickell or Edgewater. Most of Miami's real estate development in the past few decades has happened in these neighborhoods rather than downtown Miami, and I've been told that this is because there are a few families who own large swathes of downtown and they weren't interested in developing it. I'm interested to verify this information and to learn more about it, if anyone knows more about it!
Coconut Grove & Coral Gables: For a more suburban existence, you can go to leafy Coconut Grove or Coral Gables. To me, these neighborhoods feel a little bit like a tropical version of Palo Alto, CA (in a good way).Whenever I visit Coconut Grove, my friends get annoyed with me because I use the word "lush" so often.
Miami's city hall is a former seaplane terminal for Pan American, and it sits on the Coconut Grove Marina.Little Havana & Hialeah: For fun street conversations and a fantastic selection of Cuban and Central American cuisine, you can go to Little Havana or Hialeah. Little Havana was the center of the Cuban community in Miami for a long time, but it's now shifted towards Hialeah, while Little Havana now has more immigrants from Central America. Hialeah has the highest percentage of Cuban and Cuban American residents of any city in the United States, at 73.37% of the population.
↑ Mexican restaurant in Little Havana with a sense of humor. ↓
Wynwood: For an artsy neighborhood filled with color and street art, you can go to Wynwood. It has lots of hip shops, and the whole place feels like it was made to be photographed on Instagram.Little Haiti: For everything Haitian, you can go to Little Haiti. While Little Havana is really a mix of lots of Caribbean, Central American, and South American communities, Little Haiti has a larger majority of Haitians.
Walking around Little Haiti I definitely got some confused looks that seemed to say "What are you doing here?" People were very friendly and welcoming, but they just seemed confused by my presence. I got a strong sense that non-Haitians aren't typical customers at Haitian businesses in that part of town.
For example we went to a restaurant around 11am, and my friend (who admires Haitian culture a lot and has spent a fair bit of time there) asked them what they had on the menu. The woman said "It's soup time. We only have soup," but then asked, "But are you sure you want this?" with the implication that it might be too exotic for our palettes or something. He said "Yes I'm sure" and ordered 3 bowls, 1 for each of us. But then she only brought out 1 and said, "Try it first to make sure you like it". As we tried a sip, she had the most worried look on her face.
But she had nothing to worry about! The soup was tasty! And really it wasn't strange at all, in fact it tasted very familiar, like chicken soup almost. When we confirmed that we liked it and ordered more, she chuckled but also seemed like she wasn't quite sure she believed that we actually liked it.Key Biscayne: If you want to feel like you live in a golf resort and a beach resort at the same time while also having downtown Miami just 15 minutes away, Key Biscayne is the place to go.
Key Biscayne is a beautiful island off the coast of Miami. In the center, it has really nice suburban houses, and there are two massive parks on either end of the island.
My favorite detail about Key Biscayne is that electric golf carts are one of the primary ways of getting around the island. With 1 golf cart for every 13 residents, they dominate the streets. The speed limit in Key Biscayne is 20mph, and car drivers have seemed to accept that they are guests in the golf carts' kingdom.


I've only been in Miami a few months so I'm no means an expert, but I've been loving the variety and color I've discovered as I've been exploring the city. If you have recommendations for other places to explore, let me know!

Here's the neighborhood map of Miami:# IV. FAQs

Q: How is Miami's infrastructure and transit? Is it super car-centric?
I’m based in Miami Beach, an island off the coast which is quite different from Miami mainland. Miami Beach is super walkable. I don’t have a car, and I have a Whole Foods, beautiful public pool, lots of cafes, and so on within 8 minutes walking from my place. There's also a boardwalk running trail nearby which is also gorgeous, and there's a pedestrian-friendly street called Española Way with lots of restaurants.


Miami mainland is more varied depending where you are. The Brickell neighborhood is a bit like Midtown Manhattan; super dense, but in my opinion not that pleasant to walk. The Design District and Wynwood are a bit like the Mission in SF; walkable but a bit spread out.

Most of the rest of the city is very car-centered I think though. I haven’t explored the other parts so much so I can’t speak to that as much.

TLDR there are definitely some very walkable parts of Miami, though I think the median experience of the city if you just picked at totally random spot on the map would be very car-dependent.

Q: How bad was it to live in Miami Beach during Spring Break?
To be honest, I didn't really notice it until my mom texted me "Are you okay?!?!" and shared a CNN article about how Miami Beach had declared a state of emergency due to the Spring Breakers. I'm sure if I had gone for a late-night walk along Ocean Drive I would've noticed more of what was going on, but where I live in the middle of the island (which is a few blocks away from Ocean Drive) I noticed almost nothing. The only part that really impacted me was the 8pm curfew they put in place going in and out of Miami Beach, because I decided not to go to dinner with a friend on the mainland for fear of not being able to get back home, which was certainly inconvenient but not the end of the world. 

Q: What should I read/watch to get a taste of Miami without actually going there?
I'm only going to give one answer rather than inundating you in recommendations, in hopes that you actually watch it: Burn Notice. 

Burn Notice about a CIA agent whose identity was compromised so he gets stuck in Miami. He goes about the city helping little old ladies and other nice people solve impossible missions.

My favorite part is that the main character narrates throughout the show, so you learn how to tail people without being noticed and build makeshift listening devices and that sort of thing. It's also a great way to explore Miami vicariously, because they shot the show in lots of different locations throughout the city.

You can watch Burn Notice for free with Amazon Prime.


Q: Mosquitos/bugs?
I haven't noticed many bugs here in Miami Beach at all, which is super surprising since it's a tropical environment. The Miami area in general apparently has a lot of mosquitoes (though I haven't experienced them firsthand), but Miami Beach itself sprays larvicide on the streets so there aren't many mosquitoes here. I've gotten few bug and mosquito bites in the months I've gotten here, but it's not a constant nuisance.


Q: Weather?
I can't really answer this yet, because I've only been here during the winter and spring. During that time, the weather has been gorgeous and not too hot. The summer and fall will be less comfortable, especially during hurricane season (June 1 - Nov 30), but I can't speak to that from firsthand experience just yet.

Source: Weather Spark
Q: Miscellaneous facts, observations, and pointers I've picked up along that way:Here's a nice map of cycling routes in Miami.People text and drive in Miami more than any other place I've seen. I don't have stats on this, but it's hard to miss when you're walking around because people roll through stop signs while reading their phones constantly. It's honestly terrifying but also impressive how pervasive it is. The best was an Uber driver I had who was watching a rave on his phone while driving. (Photo to the right; sorry it's so blurry.)Demographics of Miami City and Miami-Dade County:Miami City's population is 58% foreign born, 72% Hispanic, and 54% Cuban.In the 2010 census, the largest ancestry groups in Miami-Dade County were:34.3% Cuban4.6% Colombian4.5% Haitian4.2% Nicaraguan3.7% Puerto Rican3.4% American2.3% Dominican2.3% German2.2% Italian2.2% Honduran2.1% Mexican1.9% Venezuelan1.8% Irish1.6% Peruvian1.5% English1.4% Jamaican1.1% Argentine1.0% RussianMiami Beach is famous for its street cats who roam the island. I don't think it's possible to spend more than a few hours exploring Miami Beach without crossing paths with at least one of them.Miami Beach also has adorable wild parakeets that migrate to Miami in early spring and tend to disappear around November.


# V. My questions 
What's the story behind BrightLine, Florida's privately-run high speed passenger rail? How do places like Miami Beach and Hialeah coordinate with Miami? My understanding is that they are separate entities from Miami City, but they feel like a fairly cohesive unit to me.What are the de jure and de facto structures of government for Miami? Where does the power for various decision reside?The reported crime rates in Miami Beach are similar or worse to SF, but it feels much, much safer here and no one has bars on their windows. It just doesn't add up to me. What's going on?My best guesses are that (a) a lot of crimes occur in nightclubs but not in the neighborhood area where I live and (b) crimes may be under-reported in SF because it's widely believed that enforcement is lax.Miami has a lot of practice in disaster response because of the hurricanes that ravage the coast every few years. I've only heard positive things from the locals about how the municipality helps prepare for hurricanes. Did that expertise transfer over to the early COVID response?Why does Meridian Avenue in South Beach between 1st and 14th have so many more trees than any other continuous street? It's glorious.
That's all for today. I'll continue sharing photos, facts, and discoveries in this Twitter thread. If you find yourself in Miami, let me know!

 Buenos Aires recommendations

                  Buenos Aires recommendations
                  

March 6th, 2022
I wrote a Buenos Aires guide with recommendations and tips for a group of friends I was traveling with in December 2021, and I figured it might be useful to other people too. I adore Buenos Aires and spend about a month each year there, so I'm always thrilled to hear when friends are going to spend time in the city, and I love sharing what I know about the place with newcomers. 

Buenos Aires is an underrated city. My friends are often surprised to hear that it's similar to Barcelona, and that several neighborhoods could have come straight out of Paris, if it weren't for the Spanish signs on the shops. Its pasta, pizza, and gelato rival that of any Italian city — people don't realize that over 60% of Argentines have some Italian ancestry, and they kept Italian food traditions alive when they came over to the New World. (Personally, I think Argentinian gelato is even better than Italian gelato...)

Buenos Aires is also very cheap. Of all the places I've been, BsAs has the highest ratio of quality of life to cost of living. A 10-minute taxi ride will cost you 50¢, and a spacious AirBNB in the nicest neighborhoods in the city can cost as little as $20 USD per night. The most expensive meal I've ever had in Argentina came out to $40 USD, and that was at one of the fanciest restaurants in the entire country.

I could gush about Argentina endlessly, but I'll stop there and just point you to the guide I wrote: 

Buenos Aires guide

The guide is focused on practical details like COVID tests, how to exchange money, restaurants, and that sort of thing. There are so many interesting things to share about Argentina's culture, monetary system, urban planning, history, and beyond, but those will come in separate posts in the future. In the meantime, you might find some of these tidbits interesting.

I hope you have an amazing time while you're in Argentina!

Devon (00:12): Hello and welcome to the second episode of Order Without Design. I'm Devon and, in this series, I get to talk about cities with the most interesting couple I know, Alain and Marie-Agnes Bertaud. The Bertauds have lived in diverse cities around the world, ranging from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to Bangkok, Thailand, and New York City to Oran, Algeria. They raised three children while living this nomadic lifestyle. For this episode, I was excited to dig into their role as parents, how it shaped their experience in cities, and what it was like to raise children in such an unconventional way. So with that, let's get started.

Devon (00:52): I live in San Francisco, a city which famously has more dogs than children. Why do you think that is?
Alain (00:59): Well, I think it's a question of generation. Probably, many women now, educated women, want to have a career and they postpone having children. They consider that it's a bit incompatible. We believe it's compatible, but it's just a question of choice. And a dog, I believe, is a substitute for a child for some time or maybe forever.

Alain (01:24): I will add that, in a way, I think it's very much related to the type of comfort and consumption you expect. When we moved from Paris to New York with a small child, we didn't have an apartment in New York. We didn't know anything about the housing market in New York. We found quickly that we could afford only one room, a studio, basically. We felt it was okay. I think it would be completely unacceptable to most American families to be living with one child in a studio.

Alain (01:56): I think also, if I remember well, that corresponds to the definition of a slum for UN Habitat. Three persons in a room, I think, is the limit. So it's a question of expectation. And to us, frankly, we never thought that living in Manhattan in a studio with a child was a hardship. We found it fun. We adapted to it. Sometimes, the child was crying when we wanted to study. There were times like that. This could happen, but we adapted to it. We could not afford a babysitter at the beginning until Marie-Agnes found some work. So when we went to parties or dinner, we would bring our child with us. We had a small stroller where we could bring the stroller in a bus or in the subway.

Alain (02:41): So it's a question of expectation, of what you expect in terms of comfort. I think that many American parents and mostly European now, Western European, think that if you have a child you need at least a two-bedroom apartment and, without that, it's impossible to have. It's, of course, not true. And again, having lived in a lot of countries with much lower income, we can see that people can survive very well in different conditions. So it's a question of expectation, of consumption, and a trade off between having a child and consuming more or less housing.

Devon (03:16): Right. You mentioned that most Americans would've found your living conditions unacceptable when you first moved to New York. What accounts for this difference?

Alain (03:24): It's true. There's something about Americans have a love for space, where the Europeans have a love for amenities in a city, being close to amenities. I think Americans have a love for space. Maybe, I don't know, the myth of the frontier or something like that. There's something about space. And indeed, there is plenty of space in America compared to Europe, but for instance when we moved, we bought a condominium when we were in Washington, then when we came back from Haiti. So we had two children at the time. And we look at the market and we found an apartment which had one bedroom and then we bought that and we had two children at the time. So basically, we had each child in one bedroom and then we will have our bed in the living room, in fact.

Alain (04:09): And the people in the condominium criticized that saying, "Well, you are overusing the apartment." They were not worried about expense in water or things like that. They thought it was, I would say, even slightly immoral. They asked us, "But they are two different sexes. Do they sleep in the same room?" or something like that. I mean, there's something, may I dare to say, puritanical about that. So they thought it was ... And then they changed the condominium rule saying that people with two children could not live in the one-bedroom apartment. So there is something, again, what is expected, what is correct.

Devon (04:47): Wow. Yeah. A sense of, "It's just not right. They're just not supposed to live that way."

Alain (04:51): That's right. And it was not either that we could not afford it. First, it was a choice. It gave us, by spending relatively little on an apartment, it gave us a lot of financial freedom. Whatever you spend on housing is not spent on other things or is not saved. It allowed us to save a lot of money, in a way and have a lot of financial freedom in terms of looking for a job. I think this was very, very precious to us.

Devon (05:21): Yeah. My boyfriend and I have made the same choice. People are always shocked to hear that we live in a one-room apartment together, despite the fact that we could afford better, but yeah. We travel a fair bit. It doesn't really make sense to spend a lot of money on an apartment that you're going to only be in for two thirds of the year. And we like going out and spending time in cafes and stuff. So it works pretty well, but it's just a choice.

Alain (05:44): It's a choice, yeah. It's a choice and people should tolerate the same as we have to tolerate that some people like to have large gardens. That's fine, that's fine, but the problem is when you impose some of your values on someone else.

Devon (05:57): When the condominium put those additional rules in place, how did you guys respond? What did you do?

Alain (06:01): Oh, we didn't do anything because we were grandfathered. They even told us that it was not directed against us, but that they felt that it was not right.

Marie-Agnes (06:12): It was to prevent others from doing that.

Devon (06:14): What other countries have similar norms to America in terms of this desire for space?

Alain (06:18): Countries that have a lot of land, like Australia, New Zealand, or Canada, which have extremely large reserves of land, and probably they have a taste for larger apartments. If you look at the size of housing, internationally, Australia, New Zealand, and Canadian and American are the ones who are outliers in terms of consumption per person of floor space. But they're also a very wealthy nations, but there is no doubt that, if you live in France or, say, in Holland, your apartment will have to be a little smaller.

Devon (06:51): My guess is that, because in America there's sort of almost always an option to just move a little farther out and there will be a place where the land is very cheap and you still have some access to metropolitan regions, whereas somewhere like the Netherlands is almost entirely built up. So it's not really even an option, except for in the most extreme cases.

Alain (07:10): Right, yeah. And so, you make a trade off here. It was, again, your social life and the use of amenities and space. For instance, where we live now, here in in New Jersey, we have very few amenities. We have some pretty good restaurants around, but that's about it. So it's kind of the access is limited compared to if we were living in the city. So it's a tradeoff we have made now in our old age to have very quiet night, to go to New York twice a week and enjoy the amenities, but in a certain way, it's a tradeoff we have made later in life, not when we had children. By the way, you know that, in France, I'm not completely sure if it's still true now, but people who have children live in the city, in Paris, for instance. They will live in the city, itself. And it's only when they retire that they go to the suburb because they feel that they are not going to go out to a theater or something when they are old.

Alain (08:05): There was even these kind of people making fun about suburbs being for retired people, in "pavilion de banlieue" with retired people who are just watering their flowers every morning because they have nothing else to do. So it's a complete opposite of Americans who usually, as soon as they have children, they tend to move to the suburbs.

Devon (08:25): Yeah. Speaking to a lot of my friends who tend to really like cities and they love living in San Francisco or New York with places with lots of amenities. They'll say, "Yes, I love the city, but when it's time to raise children, I, of course, will move out to the suburbs." So it's interesting to hear that change. Do you think that this is a function of difference of amenities in Paris, say, versus San Francisco? Is Paris a better place to raise children than San Francisco or New York?

Alain (08:52): Well, it depends what you expect. We never had teenage children in Paris when we were living there. We had just a small baby, but our French friends had teenagers and were living in the center of Paris. We had a very good friend living in Le Marais. The advantage for them is that, as soon as they were 10, 12 years old, those children were completely independent. They will go to library, museum, movies, or meet some friends and take the subway. They had roller skates. I remember, also, they will go around the city in roller skates. They were 12 years old. This was considered to be normal. I think Americans would have been very, very uneasy about that. That's a bit difference of culture.

Alain (09:32): The idea in France that, as soon as your children are teenagers, you have to drive them around to their judo lesson or their music lesson or their practice of soccer, it's completely unknown. You don't do that. The children are supposed to be independent. When I was brought up in Marseilles, I would go to the Boy Scout, for instance. I would go on my own. I would walk half an hour to go to where they were and something like that and we would take the tramway to go to picnic or something. The parents were absolutely not being the taxi for the children. It never happened.

Devon (10:09): Right. Yeah. And that means the children are more independent, but the parents are more independent, as well.

Alain (10:14): Exactly, yes. I mean, of course, I've been brought up that way, so it's normal. I think, especially living in the suburbs now, I think the life of the parents, when the children are teenagers, is really ... I think it's terrible. I mean, probably they get some reward of watching their kids play soccer or tennis or whatever, but I don't know. I think they are too much the slave of their children and I don't think it's that good for the children either because they are entirely also dependent on their parents, but I don't know. Those are just different cultures.

Devon (10:49): I imagine features of the city really depend on how safe and how comfortable and how practical it is for children to have flexibility to wander around. And you two have lived in a lot of different cities with children. How did your experience in places like Bangkok versus Port-au-Prince versus New York City vary in terms of you feeling comfortable letting your children wander around and have a lot of independence?

Marie-Agnes (11:14): And for entertaining, the children entertained themselves because they were surrounded in a safe place with other children about the same age. Even when we were in Thailand, our child Yann was, at that time 12, 14 years old. We would let him stay with Thai children on the beach. And for one week, he will be living in a Thai family, very poor family, but we knew that he was safe. We knew the family. We knew the children and it was a good advantage for our son to be independent for one week, like in a camp, but surrounded by nice people and he loves windsurfing and the people who are around him were windsurfers. So he started very quickly to be a very strong windsurfer guy in Thailand because the wind is perfect and the temperature of the water is perfect. So we can surf any time during the year.

Devon (12:16): Were your children free to wander around, independently, around Bangkok and go from place to place and take themselves to school?

Alain (12:23): Sometimes, they would go in the street, but in the neighborhood streets and buy street food for us by themselves. In Bangkok, you have a lot of street food, people selling food in the street, but they did not go outside the neighborhoods. Certainly not, no.

Devon (12:37): In which city did you feel like your children were most safe?

Alain (12:40): Everywhere, yes. Even in El Salvador, at the time ... Now, El Salvador is very unsafe, but at the time, they were a little older. They were 10 and eight. They would go around the neighborhood by themselves, by the way. They had schoolmates, which were within, I would say, one thousand yards from our house and they would go by themselves and then come back.

Marie-Agnes (13:01): They would go to the swimming pool of the hotel. It was about three blocks from our place, and they went by themselves.

Alain (13:09): And at the time, there was no telephone that we could use. I mean, the telephones were already in the house, but let's say, we were not exceptional. That was the normal thing to do. Their schoolmates in El Salvador, they were all Salvadorian, by the way. There were practically no foreigners in El Salvador in the school. And so the parents found that completely normal.

Devon (13:28): What was a time that they got in trouble?

Marie-Agnes (13:31): Yann was very independent and he was early working because he was windsurfing and he realized that we couldn't buy him, every six months, a new sail or a new board. So he worked, at the age of 16, he worked in a surf shop next door and he was getting all the material he could test and play with. And Veronique was more going to friend's place and I will drive, if I was available. If not, she will take the subway and go to the friend's place. But Marion was born later, when the children were eight and 10. She was maybe less mobile than the oldest one because the oldest had been brought up in so many countries. When Marion, born in El Salvador, when she was at the age of three, we moved to Thailand. And in Thailand, next to the office, we had a kindergarten where she went and she learned Thai, all the good manners. And she will be very polite and very respecting of adults, as the Thai children are. And we found that she was quite obedient and no problem when they get teenager.

Devon (15:04): Were there any moments where you were anxious for their safety?

Alain (15:08): I can remember only one time where we were really worried. We were traveling with a Volkswagen camper in Mexico and Yann, at the time, was three years old and Veronique was close to one. I think Yann was three years old. And so we were in a restaurant in the center of Guadalajara, in the center of the city, and we had parked the car about five or six blocks from there. All the waiters were very attentive to the children because it was two blonde children. They were taking them to the kitchen, giving them tortilla, whatever, fruits. And so we didn't pay too much attention to them. And then, when we left and paid our bill and we left, suddenly, our son was missing. Nobody knew where he was. We assumed he was in the kitchen, as he has been several times with the waiters. And then they told, "No, we haven't seen him." And we found that he had left the restaurant by himself.

Alain (16:04): And suddenly, then, we really panicked because we were in the center of the city with rough traffic. And so Marie-Agnes went on one side, I went on the other asking, "Did you see a blonde child, three years old, walking around by himself?" And so, as it was a little uncommon at the time, Yann was very blonde. His hairs were nearly white. So people noticed him in Mexico and they said, "Yes, he went this way." And eventually, we found him. He had walked five blocks. That means he crossed the street by himself several times and he was waiting for us next to the car. That was the only time where, really, we panicked about our children and we wished things were different.

Devon (16:47): How long did it take for you to find him back at the car?

Alain (16:50): Oh, maybe 20, 25 minutes because we were looking a bit everywhere.

Marie-Agnes (16:54): And we were ready to go to the police station.

Alain (16:58): Police station. Yeah, yeah.

Marie-Agnes (16:59): We thought maybe he has been kidnapped or something.

Alain (17:02): Again, at the time, Mexico was not as violent as it is now, but still, a three-year-old kid in the middle of the traffic, imagine downtown Guadalajara, the traffic is pretty, pretty... and it's not very disciplined. So you really panic about that, what can happen.

Devon (17:23): Did he explain why he'd decided to leave?

Alain (17:25): He's very independent and he has always liked cars. And for him, the car was really the thing that he was interested in and he thought he was bored in the restaurant probably and he thought the car, if he could get ... but not get into the car, of course, because it was locked. Because we were moving for three months in this Volkswagen camper. So for him, that was his house and he liked it because he liked everything which is mechanical and technological. He likes cars.

Marie-Agnes (17:52): And still, he likes cars. And I think he's like Alain and I. He has a very good sense of orientation and very early, at the age of three, he remembered exactly where the car was and taking the initiative just to walk back to the car. At three years old, few children have this idea about direction.

Devon (18:15): Right.

Alain (18:17): And the idea of leaving the restaurant where his parents were and just go by himself. Again, it shows a sense of independence.

Devon (18:25): You mentioned before that your youngest child studied, in Thailand, Thai manners and went to a Thai school?

Marie-Agnes (18:32): Yeah. She was only two and a half years old when we moved to Thailand. And both we were working in this outfit, the Housing Authority in Thailand. It's a government business. Very, very large office. And the government company had a kindergarten just next to the office. So we would drop Marion to the kindergarten and, the first month, we get the report from the kindergarten all written in Thai and we couldn't read the report, so we asked a colleague of ours to make a translation weekly about what was in the report. So she starts to do the translation verbally and then stop. Then I saw that there were two pages and she stopped after some time. And I said, "What about the other page?" And she said, "Well, I'm very embarrassed." I said, "No, no, just tell us." And the other page was saying that Marion has a tendency at the time of the break to go quickly to the swing and mobilize the swing for herself and not to let the other children use the swing.

Marie-Agnes (19:43): And that was not a good manner for the Thai. You have to share. You have to let the others take the swing. And so she would push the other children and go to the swing immediately. They were also complaining about her not respecting carefully the rules. And the rules were, at the beginning, she didn't know the rules, the rules were to bow to the teacher, take your shoes off when you enter the classroom and put the shoes all well aligned and she would not do that. So she learned very quickly. After the second month, the report was very positive and very nice.

Alain (20:24): Yeah. And especially, what was amazing was that, after, when she would come home, she would keep those manners. For instance, the way she would curtsy to us before asking something or, in the morning, she will have exactly mimicked the Thai way, which is extremely respectful with adults, always having graceful gestures. Also, every gesture to take something or to receive something is rehearsed, a bit like a ballet, in a way. You have certain gestures. You have to put your finger in a certain way and not another. If not, it's impolite. Never show the back of your feet, for instance. There are a lot of rules like that, which are extremely intricate, but that the children learn very early. And I suppose it's not a burden for them because it's become a reflex.

Alain (21:08): But as soon as she left the school, after, when she came back, she became a normal American child again. She would not curtsy to us in the morning or something like that. When we were in Yemen, Yann, our son, he was already three to five and he started learning school, but our neighbors, we had a neighbor who was the CIA station chief and his wife was a schoolteacher and she was British. And he has two daughters who were about the age of my son. The wife of this guy would take Yann and there was a school of, let's say, three children. And he learned English that way, the first time.

Alain (21:47): But for Veronique, she was younger, so it was a little more difficult. The last year we were there, when Veronique was four years old, then we wanted her to meet some kids her age. So the only solution was to put her, in fact, in a koranic school. Normally, girls in Yemen will not go to school, except koranic school. So we put her there in this koranic school. So she learned Arabic that way and also, unfortunately, she copied the manners of the kids. And one of the things Yemeni children did at the time, like their adults, was spitting all the time. So you have this little blonde girl, three years old, suddenly racking her throat and spitting. That was just opposite of the Thai manners. So we had to explain here saying, "Well, no, you should not spit all the time."

Devon (22:43): Has she kept any of those habits? Not necessarily the spitting, but anything else, if you were to meet her as an adult today? She behaves differently than an American or a French girl would?

Alain (22:53): I think children try to imitate their environment and mostly the environment of their peer, to do what their peers do. So as soon as she comes to America, she wants to be an American kid. Yann, for instance, my son, when he was a teenager, always had a baseball cap and he would absolutely refuse to even taste wine or things like that. He wanted to look American. When he was 18, he would start drinking beer out of his six pack and absolutely not touching wine or anything like that because he thought it was un-American. And by the way, when he went to California, then people say, "Oh, you are French. You must know about wine," and then he finds people who were knowledgeable about wine and, suddenly, he realizes that he has to learn about wine, too, just, I guess, to mix with the Californians. It was different from Maryland, so he abandoned his six pack there.

Devon (23:43): They're very shaped by their environment, it sounds like.

Alain (23:45): And their peers. When we came back to the States, they were a little ashamed of our accents. They were embarrassed by our accent. For instance, if we would go to a restaurant, even a fast food or something when they were 15 or something, they would say, "Let us order because the waiter will not understand you because of your accent." And they were embarrassed that, in front of other people, they would be with those adults who do not speak English with an American accent.

Devon (24:13): Do your children have an American accent?

Alain (24:15): Yes. I mean, they are better at English than French, but their French is completely fluent, but sometimes it's a domestic language, although they study French at school. But let's say, they are much more fluent in English. Actually, if we discuss politics or something a little difficult, we will switch to English with them because it's easier for them, but not for day-to-day conversation. Then we'll stick to French.

Devon (27:59): What factors do transportation planners need to take into account to serve children and families?

Alain (28:05): Well, certainly, the safety of transport is very important. So the design of subway stations or bus stations are important, but it's really the attitude of the public, in general, toward the child, whether they will be protected. The design has to do something. Again, the design of a bus stop or a subway station is important, too, so that it will be safe for children including, by the way, in Asian subway stations, usually the subway platform is completely protected when the train is not here. There are doors which open only when the train is here. So again, a child cannot be pushed or fall on the track. So that's already, for instance, a feature which I encourage children for taking the subway and being safe.

Alain (28:54): But say, you could see in Paris ... I suppose it's still true now, but when we were living in Paris, kids of eight or nine taking the subway by themselves and, at the time, the platform was not protected and they knew about it. And I assume also there that the passengers who were waiting, if they see a kid alone, will make sure that the kid doesn't go too close from the edge of the platform.

Devon (29:18): If I told you we had to put your three children in a city to live alone while they were growing up, just for, let's say, a month, the three of them were to move there together with no parents, no grandparents around, what city do you think that they would be safest in and that they would be able to get around the most easily?

Marie-Agnes (29:34): Thailand may be the best because people in Thailand are very, very protective of the children. They respect and the people are very concerned and all the time ready to help you. And if we were to leave them alone, I would not have have to ask in the neighborhood or the person who was working for us, she was not sleeping in our house. She was just coming for the day, but she would have agreed, for sure, to take the children and I would have even been accommodating her children if she was to sleep in our house so they could have an adult. This woman was very, very beautiful concerning cleanness and education. She would be very careful that they never get in trouble.

Alain (30:28): And very polite. The Thai are extremely polite at every level of society. There is not a politeness which is kind of upper class and then middle class and then, let's say, poorer class, they all have the same standards of politeness so that it makes relationships between social classes very, very easy. Compare it to India, for instance, where the level of politeness is not the same, depending on the social class. The people of upper class have often a contempt for the lower class and they show it in their manners. They are impolite, literally, with the people who work for them. So that's, again, a difficult thing to accept when you live there. But in Thailand, what we absolutely loved was these very elaborate manners were exactly the same at every level of society.

Alain (31:16): By the way, I found that in Southeast Asia, in general, I found the same thing in Indonesia or Vietnam, but especially Indonesia that people are extremely polite with each other. It doesn't mean that they cannot be exploitative or something like that. Yes, they could be, but at least they don't humiliate people who are in the lower, let's say, grade of society. That, I think, is very, very positive. In India, sometimes you see people humiliating other people because they can do it. And it's extremely, I think, disheartening. So that's, again, those culture differences.

Devon (31:53): Why do you think there are those cultural differences? Why do you see that behavior in some places, but not necessarily in others?

Alain (32:00): Because in a way, say, if you compare India and Thailand, well, Thailand is a Buddhist country. It's not Hindu, but the culture in Thailand is very, in many ways, came from India. The characters they use to write Thai are, in fact, derived from Sanskrit, or their folklore ideas they use Ramayana all the time in their stories and things like that. So it's all coming from India, except that they do not have caste. And in India, the caste system was really the structure of society and it's still there now. What's interesting in India that, when they became independent, they banned caste, but at the same time, they established very quickly a system of affirmative action for castes.

Devon (34:09): Why is it less strong in the cities?

Alain (34:11): Because I think that some people of lower caste has made it well. And so wealth attenuates this a bit, but not completely. Also, if you are trading, if you have a restaurant and half of your clients are lower caste, probably you have to treat them equally if you want to keep their patronage. So I think that it attenuates, but it's much more extreme in villages. In villages, still now in India, the lower castes often have no access to the water faucets, to the wells that the others castes use. There are certain restaurants where they cannot even go to eat.

Devon (34:51): Wow. I guess, in the city, there's more opportunity for people to be mobile and interact with different types of people.

Devon (37:27): It's a very clever way to generally do well in your career, is to find things that you don't mind doing as much as some other people mind doing, and make that your strength and just go for it. And you can become really good at it because you have less competition.

Alain (37:41): Yeah. That's interesting you say that, yes. One day, I got a fantastic job with the UN after I left Haiti. I was working for a consulting firm in Washington before we went to El Salvador and I was asked to go to Bhutan. That was in '75. And with Marie-Agnes for a month, to look at building materials in Bhutan, whether those building materials could be used for modern housing. So it was a perfect assignment. Imagine going around Bhutan for one month, looking at building temples, people were like ... So it was perfect.

Alain (38:16): So when I came back and I had a debriefing in New York at the UN about my mission in Bhutan. And I told them, "Gee, I really like this assignment. This is wonderful. I'm glad you remembered I was an architect and have a very strong interest in local building material." And they told me, "Ah, yes, that's right, but we didn't select you because of that, frankly. We looked at our roster of consultants and we thought, 'What consultant will accept to go to a country which has no hotels?' And everybody said, 'Bertaud would do that,'" because of my stay in Yemen. I never complained in Yemen about living conditions. And they knew I was ... In Yemen, I would go to small village some time, towns were there were no hotels, obviously, and things like that and I never complained.

Alain (39:04): So in a way, I had this reputation of being ready to do things that others will not do and it gave me a comparative advantage, but for me, it was fun.

Devon (39:13): Absolutely.

Alain (39:15): And of course, the stay in Bhutan was fantastically comfortable because, in fact, the Bhutanese have a system in the monastery which are, in fact, the monasteries are also part of the administrative structure. So they have a guesthouse for the civil servants who travels through Bhutan because there aren't hotels. So they stay in the monasteries in special rooms for guests and they are extremely well-treated. The food is excellent and things like that. So it's not a hotel in the traditional way, but it's very comfortable and extremely beautiful. You have a room which is painted with frescoes, which have been done in the maybe 15th century or something like that. What can you ask more?

Devon (39:55): That sounds even better than a hotel and more interesting, to boot.

Alain (39:58): Yeah, yeah. It was certainly better and you are right on the spot and you can attend the religious service, too. Any time when you hear some music, you go there and it was a fantastic thing. But for them, they thought most people will not go because there were no hotels. There was no modern hotels.

Devon (40:17): Yeah. I work for GitHub, which is a software company, and a big part of my job as a product manager here is talking to a lot of developers and a lot of software engineers and programmers and going all around the world and traveling and also doing some press and, basically, having a lot of conversations with interesting people all over the world. And this is great. This is exactly what I want to be doing and I love doing that, but I recently had a conversation with someone on my team who was like, "Oh, thank goodness you do that. I can't believe you put up with it, but thank you for taking one for the team." And I realized that some people just don't want to do that. Some people don't want to go travel all the time, be in a different bed every week, and some people are more introverted. So it's really great to be able to find something that's a comparative advantage for you where not only are you willing to put up with it, but you are excited to do it.

Alain (41:04): Yeah. That's right. Absolutely, absolutely. Yes.

Marie-Agnes (41:07): And in Bhutan, I had the chance to cook for ... We were stuck in a very mountainous place. Then there was a huge storm and the road was washed out and we couldn't pass. The car was stuck there and there was a little kind of tea shop that was serving tea and some little things. And they had a farm on this place and the lady was there with just some eggs. And I said, "Can I do an omelet with the eggs?" But she didn't understand what I was asking, but she let me use the eggs and the grease and we had an omelet with all the people who were there and we were very happy to be warm and nice. And then the schoolteacher was there, in this place, and after all, there were no hotels. And the schoolteacher, "Okay, maybe the road will not be reestablished before tomorrow. Maybe you would like to come in the school and sleep there." So we slept on the floor in a school.

Alain (42:13): Yeah. That was really wonderful. That was one of the best trips we had, actually.

Devon (42:17): That sounds like a great adventure. Yeah. You understand the place from a much better perspective. I mean, I could imagine staying in a hotel could actually really hinder your understanding of a city because the people who live there don't live in hotels. And so you end up actually missing a lot of the perspective of what it's actually like to live there. So if you're trying to provide advice for how to improve the city as far as residents, it really makes more sense to live in a context ... or in the schoolhouse where the children go and so that you can see it from that view.

Alain (42:46): Yes. That's a difficult thing sometimes. It's true. The hotel is a little haven of efficiency and tends to lose contact with reality... I remember, in Dhaka ... for instance, in Bangladesh, we were going to this place... it was a hotel run by Japanese. It was absolutely superb and, as soon as you enter, everything works well, everything is perfect, but you tend to forget then the difficulties of other people who are living in the rest of the city. It's a tiny little part of the city. And it's true, this is a problem. So that's why sometimes you are obliged to stay there in a big city because of communication. You have to work late at night, so the electricity should be in and things like that, but you have to escape. For instance, take your meals outside the hotel as much as possible. At least go to a local restaurant or something and walk.

Alain (43:41): For me, in my job, our job is to walk around the city everywhere, all the time. You don't spend your time at the hotel, except when you have to sleep or write your report or something like that.

Devon (43:52): Right. So both of you worked during very much of the time that you had children, you were raising your children, but it sounds like you both had a lot of freedom and ability to get your jobs done and you brought them around with you instead of just sort of following their schedule. By contrast, I feel like, here in America, I see that a lot of parents will put their children's schedule first. They'll pack that schedule, but because the children can't get around, the parents, usually the mother, ends up driving them from place to place. And their life kind of gets taken over by children. And so this question is sort of self-motivated because I personally would like to have children one day, but I also love the work that I do. And honestly, I don't just want to be sitting in piano lessons all the time. What advice would you have for me and for other people who would potentially want to be parents and try to live more of a life of freedom and flexibility with their children and not having it quite so much taken over by the lifestyle?

Marie-Agnes (44:51): I believe, if you have enough money to keep your job and raise a family, you have to have some help. And we've been lucky because going to developing countries, getting someone to live with you or be coming to help you during the time you are in the office is a very, very necessity because if you are all the time obliged to do all the parents that ... I see my daughter. She has a professional life, but at the beginning, that was a problem with her husband. He has been raised with a mother who was a teacher, the husband and the father was a postman, and they had a very comfortable life. And the children, because she was a teacher, so she has the same time, when the children were on vacation, she was on vacation.

Marie-Agnes (45:49): When you have a very demanding job like you or us, you cannot be all the time driving the children to the sport or to the piano lesson. And we make the choice, really, at the beginning. I was working in New York and then I was also working at the city planning commission. And my salary ... I have a babysitter. I would drop my children at her home, and my salary was split between me and her. And I knew that my son would be well taken care of because this woman had a child. And on my way to the subway, I would drop the child and taking the child back home when I was done with my work. And it was a perfect arrangement. And we have beautiful moment with this woman and her husband. We were very close friends after all and we would do picnic on the weekend together with the children and doing all sort of activity when we were not at work.

Alain (46:58): When we were in New York and Marie-Agnes started working, she didn't have a very high salary. Nor did I, by the way, but she was ready to spend half of her salary on babysitting for our child, at the time. And it was worth it, in a way. A kind of priority, in a way. Again, living in a very small apartment, in one-room apartment, but having a babysitter every day that you pay well. It's just a tradeoff and I think it's worth it. I mean, for Marie-Agnes, it was certainly worth it and for me, too, in a way, to have a wife who is also in the world professionally. We were not in the same department, not working in the same department, but it was interesting, at the end of the day, to discuss about things we have done other than if she has been confined to just taking care of the child and doing some shopping and things like that.

Alain (47:52): It's good for the children, by the way, too, with other adults with authority which are different from their parents. I think that's very good also. It's a good habit, that they aren't necessarily always only with their parents.

Devon (48:06): Yeah. What you were saying about both you and Marie-Agnes having work experience that you can come home and share is definitely an experience that I've had with Sebastian, where I feel like it's an experience I've had with my boyfriend, which is he has made me much better at my job because he has very interesting thoughts from the work he does, which is sort of tangential. He works also as a software engineer. And at least, in theory, I think I've helped him with his work, as well, just by being able to share that. I also really liked your phrasing, Marie-Agnes, that you split the salary with the babysitter. I think most people phrase it as, "We paid the babysitter," as sort of a separate thing, but it's cool for you to be framing that way because it shows how the woman who took care of your children enabled you to then go out and have more flexibility. And so she's really enabling you to go do what you want as opposed to it just being sort of a service that you're paying for.

Devon (48:57): A friend of mine recently brought his three year old to visit her grandfather in Chicago for the first time. And when they came back, he said, "Every time we bring her to a new place, it feels like she makes a step function in cognitive development." Your children traveled at a young age much more than, really, any other children that I know. I'm curious, how did this affect their development, relative to their peers? Is there anything that they understood at a younger age than most other children because they'd lived in all of these different countries?

Marie-Agnes (49:25): They understand the poverty of place. When we were in India, for example, they saw that some people were very poor... Even the rich, the children were invited to go to the swimming pool and the swimming pool was not what they were expecting. The children saw the swimming pool as we can see in France or the US and the swimming pool was just a basin with green algae floating and they didn't dare to put their feet in the water because they saw that it was not a swimming pool. But they see the difference between the way people live and the way we were living. Even so, we were working in this place, we all the time be in a comfortable apartment or houses with a lot of facility, but they could see the other children, very poor children, were asking for food or begging.

Marie-Agnes (50:24): And I remember, when we were in Mumbai and we were in the Taj Mahal Hotel, and we went out visit, just out in the street. And Veronique was only 10 years old and she was scared to see the children at the gate of the hotel without arms or legs and begging. She was horrified by seeing a child be without an arm or without a leg and that was maybe shocking for her, but certainly, it gave them the feeling that we were rich and the poor people were ... But Veronique, when we were living in Washington, DC, she went to the French school. And for lunchtime, normally the parents will give a lunchbox for lunch. And Veronique had her lunchbox going to the French school, but in the French school, you had the children from embassies, from African Embassy, particularly, where at lunchtime, the driver of the embassy will bring for the children a warm lunch because the driver was supposed to care also for the children.

Marie-Agnes (51:43): And Veronique asked us, "Are we poor?" And we said, "Why do you say that?" And she said, "But we don't have a driver to bring me the lunch at school." She was about 12 years old, 10 or 12 years old, when she asked this question. That surprised us, thinking that because we didn't have a driver, we were poor.

Alain (52:09): That shows that, in fact, they had forgotten the lesson that they had seen when they were younger. When we were in Yemen or even in Thailand or even in El Salvador, they saw very poor people and they were struck by it. They talked about how privileged we were. But as soon as we were in Washington, again, it was their peers they compared with, not with what they have learned before. And so they thought that, compared to their peers, they were poor.

Devon (52:38): What a breadth of experience, seeing everything from children begging on the street to children getting a hot lunch from their driver. You end up getting a much broader cross section of life than if you end up living in just one place.

Alain (52:51): Yes, yes. Exactly. Yes.

Devon (52:54): Well, this was a really fun conversation. Marie-Agnes, Alain, thank you very much.

Alain (52:59): Thank you.

Marie-Agnes (52:59): Thank you, Devon.

September 16th, 2019
I got back from Los Angeles last night and my head is still spinning. I’d move there again in a heartbeat.

There are three great cities in the United States: there’s Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York – in that order. 

I love Boston; I even love Denver; I like Miami; I think Washington DC is habitable; but Los Angeles is Los Angeles. You can’t compare it to Paris, or to London, or to Rome, or to Shanghai. You can interestingly contrast it to those cities, sure, and Los Angeles even comes out lacking; but Los Angeles is still Los Angeles. 
[Image: L.A., as photographed by Marshall Astor].
No matter what you do in L.A., your behavior is appropriate for the city. Los Angeles has no assumed correct mode of use. You can have fake breasts and drive a Ford Mustang – or you can grow a beard, weigh 300 pounds, and read Christian science fiction novels. Either way, you’re fine: that’s just how it works. You can watch Cops all day or you can be a porn star or you can be a Caltech physicist. You can listen to Carcass – or you can listen to Pat Robertson. Or both. 

L.A. is the apocalypse: it’s you and a bunch of parking lots. No one’s going to save you; no one’s looking out for you. It’s the only city I know where that’s the explicit premise of living there – that’s the deal you make when you move to L.A. The city, ironically, is emotionally authentic. 

It says: no one loves you; you’re the least important person in the room; get over it.

What matters is what you do there. 
[Image: An extraordinary photograph, called 4.366 Braille, by jenlund70].
And maybe that means renting Hot Fuzz and eating too many pretzels; or maybe that means driving a Prius out to Malibu and surfing with Daryl Hannah as a means of protesting something; or maybe that means buying everything Fredric Jameson has ever written and even underlining significant passages as you visit the Westin Bonaventure. Maybe that just means getting into skateboarding, or into E!, or into Zen, Kabbalah, and Christian mysticism; or maybe you’ll plunge yourself into gin-fueled all night Frank Sinatra marathons – or you’ll lift weights and check email every two minutes on your Blackberry and watch Bruce Willis films. 

Who cares? 

Literally no one cares, is the answer. No one cares. You’re alone in the world. L.A. is explicit about that. 

If you can’t handle a huge landscape made entirely from concrete, interspersed with 24-hour drugstores stocked with medications you don’t need, then don’t move there. 

It’s you and a bunch of parking lots. 

You’ll see Al Pacino in a traffic jam, wearing a stocking cap; you’ll see Cameron Diaz in the check-out line at Whole Foods, giggling through a mask of reptilian skin; you’ll see Harry Shearer buying bulk shrimp. 

The whole thing is ridiculous. It’s the most ridiculous city in the world – but everyone who lives there knows that. No one thinks that L.A. "works," or that it’s well-designed, or that it’s perfectly functional, or even that it makes sense to have put it there in the first place; they just think it’s interesting. And they have fun there. 

And the huge irony is that Southern California is where you can actually do what you want to do; you can just relax and be ridiculous. In L.A. you don’t have to be embarrassed by yourself. You’re not driven into a state of endless, vaguely militarized self-justification by your xenophobic neighbors. 

You’ve got a surgically pinched, thin Michael Jackson nose? You’ve got a goatee and a trucker hat? You’ve got a million-dollar job and a Bentley? You’ve got to be at work at the local doughnut shop before 6am? Or maybe you’ve got 16 kids and an addiction to Yoo-Hoo – who cares?

It doesn’t matter.

Los Angeles is where you confront the objective fact that you mean nothing; the desert, the ocean, the tectonic plates, the clear skies, the sun itself, the Hollywood Walk of Fame – even the parking lots: everything there somehow precedes you, even new construction sites, and it’s bigger than you and more abstract than you and indifferent to you. You don’t matter. You’re free.
[Image: Two beautiful photos by Andrew Johnson; here’s the left, here’s the right].
In Los Angeles you can be standing next to another human being but you may as well be standing next to a geological formation. Whatever that thing is, it doesn’t care about you. And you don’t care about it. Get over it. You’re alone in the world. Do something interesting. 

Do what you actually want to do – even if that means reading P.D. James or getting your nails done or re-oiling car parts in your backyard. 

Because no one cares. 

In L.A. you can grow Fabio hair and go to the Arclight and not be embarrassed by yourself. Every mode of living is appropriate for L.A. You can do what you want. 

And I don’t just mean that Los Angeles is some friendly bastion of cultural diversity and so we should celebrate it on that level and be done with it; I mean that Los Angeles is the confrontation with the void. It is the void. It’s the confrontation with astronomy through near-constant sunlight and the inhuman radiative cancers that result. It’s the confrontation with geology through plate tectonics and buried oil, methane, gravel, tar, and whatever other weird deposits of unknown ancient remains are sitting around down there in the dry and fractured subsurface. It’s a confrontation with the oceanic; with anonymity; with desert time; with endless parking lots. 

And it doesn’t need humanizing. Who cares if you can’t identify with Los Angeles? It doesn’t need to be made human. It’s better than that.#cars

 A libertarian just won Argentina's presidency... what's going on?

                  A libertarian just won Argentina's presidency... what's going on?
                  

November 21st, 2023
If you're wondering how the heck a hardline libertarian just won the Argentinian presidential election, here's some background.

First, a key fact is that the government is printing money at an accelerating rate, resulting in 143% annual inflation as of the most recent count. The economy is deteriorating rapidly, the poverty rate has spiked to more than 40%, and the daily indignities of Argentina's topsy turvy monetary policy are mounting. If you ask an Argentinian, it's a question of when hyperinflation will kick in, not if.

Second, the race came down to two candidates:Sergio Massa: Current Minister of Economy, in charge of the state treasury. (Yes, he's the head guy overseeing the economy just as the government prints all of those increasingly worthless pesos!)Javier Milei: A political outsider with hardline libertarian beliefs who wants to dramatically reduce the scope of government and is seen as a loose canon for his eccentric personal beliefs.Milei is a character...
Milei's radical platform included plans to:Dollarize the economy, i.e. adopt the US dollar as the country's currency so that leaders like Massa can't just keep printing money. This is like Argentina tying itself to the proverbial mast.Cut a huge portion of the government to curb rampant corruption and patronage. An astonishing 55%* of workers registered in Argentina work for the government and directly benefit from increased government spending, so this will be extremely unpopular. (*The 55% number is a bit misleading because a lot of Argentina's economic activity is in the informal sector, so a huge portion of the workforce is not registered.)
Massa represents the incumbent establishment:Massa identifies as a Peronist, the same party as the current sitting president, Alberto Fernández. Many Argentinians think that Massa has been the top dog leading the government since Fernández's popularity waned dramatically in the past few years. (Fernández decided not to run again even though he's only in his first term.)Practically this means that electing Massa would have meant more of the same. He would have continued solving political problems by handing out subsidies/jobs and solving the resulting fiscal shortfalls by printing more pesos.
In short, this was an election between continuity vs change. Few predicted that Milei would win because he is... quirky, to say the least. All you need to do is watch some of his YouTube videos to see that he's a bit unhinged. Sure, Massa is associated with the country's current economic woes, but people thought "at least he's a known quantity and has experience in politics".

 But to everyone's surprise, Milei won in a landslide victory! Here's Milei's victory speech laying out his vision. His 12 point lead made it clear that Argentinians are angry – so angry that they're willing to accept abrupt, extreme changes in hopes that it gets the country on a better path. 

I guess once you frame the choice as "vote for (a) the current Minister of Economy who's actively guiding Argentina towards hyperinflation or (b) a guy who thinks that's a bad idea", it sounds insane that Massa was even considered a reasonable candidate, let alone a top contender! And yet he still got 44% of the vote...

Don't get me wrong, I have my reservations about Milei. I disagree with him on some key issues, and his temperament may create more problems than it solves. But I think he has the right ideas for most pressing issues Argentina is facing (namely economic ones), and I'm happy that someone is finally pointing out that the emperor has no clothes and trying to change it, rather than simply continuing down the same path that got Argentina into this mess in the first place. 

 No one knows if Milei has what it takes to achieve the goals he's set out for the country. He's good at capturing attention, but is he good at leading? He lacks experience pushing policies through, and Argentinians have a tendency to ignore and resist changes from a centralized authority, so we'll see how far he gets.

 But this is at least a good first step. I'm happy to see Argentinians sending a clear message that the current leaders who are leading the country further down a path of ruin that they do not have popular support. I'm cautiously optimistic that this could be a turning point in the country's history. Argentina is a wonderful place and deserves better. Viva la libertad, carajo!

 North American vs Japanese zoning

                  North American vs Japanese zoning
                  

May 30th, 2018
I originally published these notes in April of last year in one of my old blogs.

These notes come from reading two blog posts from the wonderful Urban Kchoze blog:Urban kchoze: Japanese zoning (here is the annotated and cached copy)Urban kchoze: euclidian zoning (here is the annotated and cached copy)The Japanese system is inclusionary, as contrasted to the exclusionary system common here in the US. The typical zoning form in America is called euclidian zoning, which specifies the allowed uses and dimensions for a zone. Japan zones limit the "maximum nuisance" in a zone, and allow for any development below that threshold (e.g. a factory can’t be built in a residential neighborhood but housing can be built in a light industrial zone). You can think of this as whitelist vs blacklist approaches. The result in the Japanese case is a lot more mixed use development, while in the US land use is a lot more segregated.

Japanese zoning practiceszoning is a national law, not a municipal by-lawin the US, cities control their own zoning; but many cities (especially smaller ones) don’t have the expertise to plan a city decentlyin Japan, the national government mobilizes expertise to make a good set of lawslocal application is left to city governments, so cities have the execution power, but they have guidelines to work off ofdownside – fewer possibilities for experimentationthere are only 12 zonesrange from low-rise residential zones to exclusively industrial zonesin the US, there are often hundreds of different zoneszones allow a "maximum use" rather than an exclusive use for each zonethe Japanese principle is to include all uses up to a maximum "nuisance level"every use considered less of a nuisance than the set zone is allowed, so low-nuisance uses are allowed everywhereas a result, almost all Japanese zones allow mixed use developmentsin N American zoning, a zone clearly specifies what is allowed in it (a sort of "whitelist" approach), and zones allow only one or two usesplanning departments must micromanage the smallest detail – if they forget to zone for enough commercial zones or schools, they need to change the zoning later and therefore confront NIMBYsa lot of needed uses are forgotten => they then have to be built on the outskirts of the cityhyper-competent micromanaging is much reduced in Japanese planningdoesn’t differentiate different types of residential useN American zoning tends to treat single-family and multifamily as two separate uses to keep segregatedin Japan, if a building is used to provide a place to live to people, it’s residential, that’s all – whether it’s rented, owned, houses one or many households, it doesn’t mattermaximum ratios of building to land areas still restrict how high and how dense residential buildings may be, so you’re not going to get a 10-story apartment block in the middle of single-family housesin American cities, if the planning department doesn’t plan for enough multifamily or single-family zones, you can create big problemsthere may be shortages of either multifamily or single-family zones, pushing prices up for that kind of housingin practice, it’s most often rental units that get the shaft, resulting in sky-high rents as there is a rental unit crisis (ahem, San Francisco…)in Japan, multifamily homes tend to congregate around schools, commercial sectors or train stations. This makes sense, because the $$ per square foot of land of multifamily uses is higher than for single-family homesrational rather than arbitrary height limitsthe farther a building is set back from the street and the wider the street, the higher it can berules sometimes omitted when they want to build higher buildingsin the US, rules are often determined by what’s already in the neighborhoodcities have the right to make exceptions, require certain geometric criteria, etcbut the defaults are set by the national governmentresultsthe Japanese model has created/protected urban settings that are far more people focused and walkablemuch more market-based, responsive to demandthis isn’t the only modele.g. New Urbanists push for form-based zoning to favor walking and to allow mixed-use developments

American zoning practices: Euclidian zoninga typical American suburb comprises blocks of nearly identical single-family homesthis is not an emergent phenomenon, where individuals just happened to all choose to build their homes in the same wayzoning defines and strictly limits urban developmentsin N America, the typical standards are what is called "euclidian zoning" (from the city of Euclid, Ohio)extremely strictconsiders single- and multi-family homes to be two separate uses to separate, as are semi-detached houses and fully detached houses (contrasted against European and Asian zoning, which consider residential as residential)originates from racial segregationat first, zoning explicitly banned certain raceswhen it was ruled unconstitutional, they used different ways to achieve the same resultminorities were disproportionately poor — more likely to rent, and when they were owners they tended to buy smaller homes => so zoning (a) banned multifamily buildings in single-family areas and (b) established minimum lot and building sizesgreatly limits densitywhy?simple to enforce – simply measure dimensions and see if they conform to the rulessatisfies those with a desire to control the built area of their immediate neighborhood, but terrible for macro-management of decent communitiesthe neighborhood doesn’t change much once it’s built up => NIMBYs love itconsequencesdelays/kills projects => strangles redevelopment and "keeps neighborhoods in formaldehyde", effectively makes change illegalultimate empowerment tool for NIMBYsironically, it means that the only time it’s worth it for developers to confront NIMBYs is to build condo towers, because the profit of denser units justifies fighting for ityet duplexes/rowhouses/etc would be a better, more gradual evolutionresults in sprawl; easier to build out than densifyif the land is reserved only for single-family detached houses, then the profit value of each square foot is kept artificially lowoversupply of single-family lotsshortage of land for multifamily and commercial developmentencourages corruptionwhen zoning blocks a highly profitable project, you need a zoning modification to let it throughdevelopers have an incentive to buy off elected officials#city

                  How to Use Evernote for Your Creative Workflow
                  
clipping

December 30th, 2018
By Tiago Forte of Forte Labs

Let’s imagine how you would use Evernote if you had a brain.

I previously explained how the standard tag-based approach basically contradicts everything we know about creativity and how the human brain works.
After a few months of tinkering, I’m ready to attempt an answer to the reverse question:What would it look like to use Evernote as the basis for a creative workflow, in line with known neuroscience principles?
To answer it, we have to drill down into Evernote’s original mission:"To give you a second brain"
What does that mean exactly? What, in fact, would we use a second brain for?

I want to dispel a myth: It’s not just "remembering things." Our brains are not particularly good at that anyway, so having a second one wouldn’t help much.

This includes the storage and retrieval of straightforward factual information: parking tickets, receipts, user manuals, packing lists, recipes, menus, business cards, language materials, doctor’s notes, government documents, tax documents, logins/passwords, school assignments, etc.

This is "dumb" information by design, so an intelligent tool doesn’t add much value.

What the brain does best is thinking. Evernote is most valuable not as a remembering tool, but as a thinking tool.

But this presents us with a tall order. Are we really claiming that a software program can think?

We learned in the New York Times recently that storing a single human brain’s connectome (the complete map of all neurons and the interconnections between them) would take half the planet’s digital storage capacity: 1.3 billion terabytes. In other words, to store just a static map of the physical brain structure of two individuals would require 100% of global storage capacity.

And that’s just the structure, not counting any actual processing. We only have the roughest idea of what that would require, but last year the world’s 4th most powerful supercomputer took 40 minutes to simulate just 1 second of 1% of a brain’s activity. So, we’re not even close.

If a tool like Evernote doesn’t add much value performing low-level tasks like "remembering things," and it’s incapable of performing high-level creative thinking, what is it good for?

Answer:Mid-level thinking that interfaces between low-level
memory and high-level creativity, making the
latter as easy, fast, and efficient as possibleTo describe what this "mid-level thinking" looks like, we need to dive deep into what creativity means and how it’s enabled.
But let’s not be satisfied with the many books and articles that merely describe creativity in logical circles ("Creativity is seeing things in an original way" Really?!)
We need to answer, in detail: What exactly are the conditions required for high-performance creativity, and how can we use Evernote to create these conditions?
I can think of 5.1. Promoting unusual associationsIt’s been said in many different ways: creativity is connecting things, especially things that don’t seem to be connected.
Eddie Opara writes in The Atlantic, describing his research scanning the brains of highly accomplished creatives, that "creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections…"
Evernote’s ability to capture an extremely diverse range of media formats is a strong hint that this is what it should be used for. It prioritizes this kind of flexibility over speed (it’s terribly slow), collaboration (which usually leads to sync errors), and even stability (it’s one of the buggiest programs of its prominence around).

Scott Barry Kauffman writes in Harvard Business Review: "…increased sensitivity to unusual associations is another important contributor to creativity."
What better way to increase your sensitivity to such associations than by keeping content from wildly diverse sources in one location?2. Creating visual artifacts of ideasResearch on cognition has shown that our basic mode of thinking is not abstract reasoning and planning, but "interacting via perception and action with the environmental situation."
Essentially, it’s easier for us to interact with physical objects in the environment than with abstract ideas in our heads.
Just think of the last time you had to sit down and make a list to "get things off your mind." Or the last time you brainstormed using Post-Its and suddenly found ideas emerging in the interactions between the pieces of paper.
The book Learning to Think Spatially tells the story of how Watson and Crick used this approach to discover the structure of DNA.
Although their model had to account for abstract chemical and mathematical observations, they relied heavily on building physical models to arrive at the double helix.
Manifesting their thinking in external structures revealed approach vectors that pure math and two-dimensional diagrams simply couldn’t provide.
By externalizing your ideas in a variety of formats — text, sketches, photos, videos, documents, diagrams, webclips, hyperlinks — you create a system of distributed cognition across "artifacts" that can be moved, edited, rearranged, and combined.
You don’t need "artificial intelligence" to do the thinking for you (the stupidity of even the most advanced personal assistant app is testament to this). You just need visual and spatial anchors for the most advanced supercomputer on the planet — your brain.3. Incubating ideas over long periods of timeI think one of the least appreciated methods for connecting ideas and producing breakthrough work is the "slow burn."
Richard Feynman put it best:"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"Too often, we force ourselves to take an idea from blue sky ideation to practical execution in 48 hours flat. We call it a "rapid prototyping sprint," and pride ourselves on how little time was spent, as if a new idea is something to be excreted and moved on from as quickly as possible.

But again, this is not how our mind works. I don’t need to tell you anecdotes about how the brain continues working on problems through the night, or as you do household chores, or take a shower, or do grocery shopping. Ok just one: August Kekulé discovered the structure of benzene in a dream.

This post is itself the product of a long, slow burn. It uses 25 direct sources, and many other indirect ones, collected over more than 2 years, but once those pieces were in place, it only took 18 hours to sit down and write.

Think about how much longer it would have taken me to find, read, summarize, and synthesize that many sources, starting from scratch.
Even when we do invest the time, we usually don’t create notes that can be re-used and recycled in other projects. We don’t know what we know, because this information, which we’ve spent precious time and attention to absorb, remains disconnected, fragmented, and scattered. The seeds of insight hide in mysteriously titled folders and documents, opaque black boxes floating in the cloud.
Evernote provides much of the infrastructure for making the slow burn possible. It is durable, universal, centralized, and persistent, increasing the chance that your "dozen favorite problems" repeatedly see the light of day.4. Providing the raw material for unique interpretations and perspectivesWith all the hysteria around machines replacing jobs, there’s one sobering trend that I don’t feel is getting the attention it deserves: increasingly, it is not low-skilled and routine jobs that are being replaced, it is jobs requiring skill, advanced training, complexity, and even human contact.

So much for "more education" being the answer to all our employment troubles.

A big part of the problem is that, as Cal Newport says, "knowledge workers dedicate too much time to shallow work — tasks that almost anyone, with a minimum of training, could accomplish."

If you work like a dumb machine, your job is easily replaced by a dumb machine.

His solution is straightforward, if not exactly actionable: "We need to spend more time engaged in deep work — cognitively demanding activities that leverage our training to generate rare and valuable results."

But just try ignoring this "shallow work" (email, meetings, etc.) for a couple days and see what happens.

The solution is suggested by another study, seeking to identify which kinds of jobs best survived the technological replacement of the last tech boom.

What they found was interesting: it wasn’t jobs requiring advanced skills, or comprehensive knowledge, or years of training that fared best. It was jobs that required the ability to convey "not just information but a particular interpretation of information."
In other words, the jobs that seem to best resist technological unemployment are those that involve building, maintaining, promoting, and defending a particular perspective.
Think of a salesperson citing past results to close a sale. Or a researcher using data to back up their interpretation of an experiment. Or a project manager citing a couple key precedents to support a decision. All these perspectives can benefit from a repository of supporting information.
And here’s where a tool like Evernote comes in. Because defending a perspective takes ammunition.
And by ammunition, I mean examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes, book notes — these are the kinds of things you should be capturing.
The more raw material you have to work with, and the more diverse your sources are, the stronger and more original your argument will be.5. Creating opportunities for resonanceThe previous point may have left you wondering, "So what does amassing vast amounts of research have to do with creativity?"
First, don’t think quantity, think quality. Again, the design of the app hints at this in multiple ways: upload restrictions, rapidly declining performance when a note gets more than a few pages long, and only 3 possible levels of hierarchy (note, notebook, stack).
Instead, you should pick and choose what you capture very carefully. Think of Evernote as a Cliff’s Notes to everything valuable that you’ve learned in the past — it should include only the key points, not every single detail. Like a cheat sheet for life, but you get somewhere between 60 MB and 10 GB per month, instead of just a 3 x 5" notecard.
But don’t go to the other extreme, being too picky about what you save. The best rule of thumb is not to set out explicit decision criteria for what you keep. Just thinking about that is exhausting.
Instead, use resonance as your criteria. As in, "that resonates with me." We know from neuroscience research that "emotions organize — rather than disrupt — rational thinking." Often, when something "resonates" with us, it is our intuitive/right brain/System 1 mind telling us something is valuable before our analytical/left brain/System 2 mind even knows what’s going on. It’s no coincidence that the former is the same part that drives creativity, spontaneity, and self-expression.
In fact, I very often find that the most counterintuitively insightful pieces of information I save are the ones whose practical application is initially the least clear. My intuition tells me there’s something special about what I’m seeing or hearing, and only much later does the logic become clear.
There’s empirical evidence this really works. From the book Designing for Behavior Change:"Participants in a famous study were given four biased decks of cards — some that would win them money, and some that would cause them to lose. When they started the game, they didn’t know that the decks were biased. As they played the game, though, people’s bodies started showing signs of physical "stress" when their conscious minds were about to use a money-losing deck. The stress was an automatic response that occurred because the intuitive mind realized something was wrong — long before the conscious mind realized anything was amiss."Their conclusion: "Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness."
This happened to me recently listening to Tim Ferriss’ interview with Brené Brown on vulnerability. I pulled over on the side of the road to take these notes, because they resonated so powerfully with me.
I have no idea what vulnerability has to do with my work on productivity and innovation, but I’m 100% sure I will find a connection eventually.Misdirected optimization is the root of all evilKnowing what secondary thinking functions we need Evernote to help us with is a good first step, but since they still require our involvement, we need to perform them as efficiently as possible.
But efficiency is a function of inputs and outputs. So the next question we need to answer is, "What is our most scarce resource?"
Or in other words:What are we optimizing for?This turns out to be a fairly profound question, with radical implications for how we organize the information in our lives.
To illustrate:
•If you are optimizing for storage space, you’ll sign up for the cheapest cloud storage service you can find. There are some out there so cheap, it can take them a couple days to retrieve your data if you need it.
•If you’re optimizing for security, you’d better not use cloud services at all, and store your data in encrypted files backed up to RAID 10s. And don’t forget to distribute them to remote bank vaults in case of nuclear attack.
•For comprehensiveness, you hoard every single thing you come across in its entirety, like a digital packrat. These are the people complaining they can’t use Evernote because of the upload limitations (trust me — they are there for your protection).
•For collaboration, you go with a real-time, browser-based editing platform like Google Docs.
•For simplicity, you go with Dropbox, and its Zen no-features-as-feature.
You get the idea.
I use these platforms and many others to store various kinds of information, but there is a reason Evernote is uniquely suited to the demands of creative knowledge work, and continues to be so beloved in tech and startup circles.
It optimizes for the most important metric in the modern digital workplace:Return-on-Attention (ROA)The concept of Return-on-Attention came to me as I was wrestling with a different, but highly related question:What makes one note more valuable than another?No approach to organizing information can add value without answering this question. A system that doesn’t make distinctions is one that just makes information overload worse.
Many people’s first reaction is to assume that, if the value of information is in its connections to other information, we should label as many of these connections as possible. This leads to the tactic of tagging each note with as many conceivable categories as possible.
But this approach reveals a fundamental paradox: any attempt to increase the value of a piece of information by tagging, labeling, categorizing, grouping, cross-referencing, or otherwise explicitly identifying a relationship of any kind, in reality has the potential of limiting how this information is used.
For example, for the research paper cited above on cognition, one of the most influential works on my thinking, I had the following tags assigned to the note where it was captured:complexity, cybernetics, decision making, GTD, information management, information overload, knowledge work, neuroscience, notes, optimization, prioritization, problem solving, productivity, project managementAt first glance, this seems like a wonderful job I’ve done associating this note with so many categories. But what I’ve realized is that for such an insightful (i.e. valuable) work as this one, these tags represent a constraint on my future efforts to link this information with new and unexpected ideas.
These tags represent, by definition, pre-existing problem frames through which to view this information. Remember our definition of creativity above?…connecting things, especially things that don’t seem to be connected.By labeling this note with so many cross-referenced tags, I’m not only locking myself into conventional ways of approaching these fields, I’m creating a false sense of confidence that I’ll be able to find the "right" information when I need it.
In the creativity-driven, exponentially changing world we live in, the opportunity cost of missing a note because it’s "in the wrong box" is simply too high.
But I also couldn’t accept the polar opposite: having no structure whatsoever, letting all the notes slosh around randomly, relying on the magical savior of search to rescue me. There had to be a middle path.
The conclusion I came to was that there is no substitute for the deeply creative act of seeing two puzzle pieces, and applying focused attention to intuit how they fit together. No system can directly replace this kind of thinking through "hard links," so the only option is to make the process of creating "soft links" on the fly as easy as possible, thus conserving the amount of attention applied.
The Wikipedia article on systems thinking explains why soft systems are preferable to hard systems in this situation. Soft systems are ideal for"Systems involving people holding multiple and conflicting frames of reference.And for"…understanding motivations, viewpoints, and interactions."This, my friends, is exactly the work of creativity.Loading and UnloadingWhat then is the main cognitive barrier to comparing two ideas? It’s the process of "loading" an idea into your brain. Initially this takes a considerable amount of time, as we consume close to 100% of the material to get the 5–10% (at most) that is actually valuable. The problem comes when we step away from our desks, promptly forgetting ("unloading") the superstructure of ideas we’re holding in our short-term memory, since we don’t make any effort to preserve the thinking that was done.
This is best illustrated by the experience of putting a complex project aside, and only returning to it months later. The relevant ideas are no longer in RAM, and it takes you a lot of time/energy to get "back to speed."
On the other hand, think of the immersion you feel after spending a couple solid hours on a problem, where you have all the main ideas at your mental fingertips.
Think about the investment reaching this state of mind entails. It’s not just your years of education and training, your vast store of work and life experiences, the effort of managing stress, nutrition, exercise, sleep, etc. so that you’re functioning at your best. We could consider all that your "administrative overhead."
What really makes it terribly expensive is the startlingly small amount of time you actually have to focus on deep, meaningful work. I’ve been meticulously tracking my time for years, and I find that I almost never spend more than about 15 hours per week on focused, creative tasks, despite the fact that I work alone.
Returning to Cal Newport: "…Unlike every other skilled labor class in the history of skilled labor, [knowledge workers] lack a culture of systematic improvement."
And it’s true. If we consider these periods of intense, focused work as our primary asset as knowledge workers, and think about how precious few hours of quality attention we have to spend each week, and how few weeks and years we have on this planet to make something that matters, it is unforgivable that we make no effort to build a knowledge base that appreciates over time. Each day we start again from scratch, trading something invaluable for something merely valuable.
What is the best way to intelligently manage a scarce resource? Measure it.
This realization helped me answer the question of what makes one note more valuable than another:The value of a note corresponds to how much attention you’ve spent on itIn an economy where attention really is currency, the value of a note is based on how much attention has been invested in it. In the same way that the price of a physical product is based on the cost of goods that have been invested in it.
This in turn suggests an entirely new purpose for Evernote:A system for tracking how much attention has been paid to a given noteMy conclusion was that the global structure of Evernote’s notebooks and stacks is relatively unimportant. I keep notebooks just specific enough to make it obvious where a particular note belongs, mostly to satisfy my spatial itch.
The most salient factor in making ideas accessible for day-to-day use is instead the design of individual notes.
Let me give you a tangible example based on this note:
1 "."I originally clipped this Amazon product page, reminding me that I wanted to read this book.
Almost no attention was spent, so the value of this note was 1 on a scale of 1–10
2. A couple months later, when I had some free time, I read the book, highlighting the parts I thought were most interesting in the Kindle app and exporting them (I use Bookcision for Kindle or the built-in "Share to Evernote" feature in iBooks and Pocket) to the note.
Some time and attention were applied, so its value is now 4, although it’s still too much information to "load" quickly
3. A few weeks later, I reviewed this note and spent some time re-reading my notes, bolding the most insightful and unique sections.
Value now equals 7, as I can much more quickly assimilate the key points by scanning only the bolded sections
4. Some time later, when I started a project drawing on this area, I reviewed only the bolded parts and highlighted (using Evernote’s separate highlighting feature, in yellow) only the very most important parts, leaving me with only 15 highlighted sections from a whole book.
Considerable time and attention has now been applied, and it would be difficult to justify this "expense" if the results of my thinking were not stored in a durable, easily loadable format. Note that as the total amount of content highlighted has dwindled, it has become much easier to quickly grasp its key points, increasing its value proportionally to 10
This note has now become a potent information weapon, its ideas and facts ready to be used in a wide variety of future contexts, at a moment’s notice.Note DesignWhat we’re talking about here is putting a lot more thought into the design and structure of each individual note. It is about making individual notes the most prominent actors, like discrete atoms that can be assembled into any form.
Design is always about balancing priorities — in this case: comprehensiveness and compression.
Compression values condensing big ideas into small packages. We gain tremendous value in condensing the Bible (and even whole religions) into the rule of thumb "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Consuming highly compressed ideas is inherently rewarding, because we can feel that each word is rich with substance. It also helps us conserve our precious attention by eliminating the "fluff" (see Derek Sivers’ post on "compressing knowledge into directives" for more examples).
Comprehensiveness values knowing all the facts. It is the voice in your head that says "Prove it." It wants more data, and examples, and cited sources. It is the fear that you’ll remember the main point, but forget why it matters. It helps us not let anything fall through the cracks, but also drives us toward packrat insanity.
The way to balance these competing priorities is to:
1 "."Progressively summarize the most important points of a source in small stages (compression), and…
2 "."Preserve each of these stages in layers that can be peeled back on demand (comprehensiveness).
Basically, you need to be able to quickly assimilate the main points of a source to evaluate its relevance to the task at hand, while simultaneously preserving the ability to quickly "go deeper" into the source if you judge it to be highly relevant.
But even this "going deeper" must be staged, because you want to avoid creating a black-or-white, all-or-nothing choice between reading just a few key points, or having to go back and re-read the entire original source.
This is the problem with articles summarizing the "actionable tips" from influential books. Without the ability to selectively explore the context of a given tip, it means nothing.
Note: reader Chanmin Woo brought my attention to a great app called Liner (getliner.com), an iOS app and Chrome extension that allows you to simply highlight any passage on a page (which you can then save to Evernote in its entirety). This is a great way to save a specific passage while retaining the context of the page.
Most notes will fall somewhere on a spectrum of relevance, and you want to be able to calibrate the corresponding time you spend "loading" them.
This layering turns a note from a dense, impenetrable jungle into a rocky landscape:

Sometimes you want to do a high-elevation flyover, seeing only the highest peaks. Other times you want to explore the middle ranges by helicopter, perhaps identifying stories or juicy factoids to illustrate a point. And sometimes, you want to parachute in and hack your way through the underbrush, poring over each source and following every rabbit trail.
Designing your note in easily uncoverable layers is like giving yourself a digital map of the terrain that can be zoomed in or out to any level of detail you need. You’re creating an environment in which your "radar" — your semi-conscious, rapid scanning ability to recognize complex patterns and non-obvious connections intuitively —works to maximum effect.
There’s a few key qualities that make this system both useful and feasible:1. Non-universalThis system is very purposefully not universal. The last thing you want to do is put every single note through multiple layers of compression. That is a terrible waste of attention.
Instead, customize the level of compression based on how intuitively important the source is to your work. I would guess my personal breakdown, with about 2,300 notes, is approximately as follows:
•1 layer of compression (saving any notes on the source): 50%
•2 layers (bolding the best parts): 25%
•3 layers (highlighting the very best parts): 20%
•4 layers or more (restating the ideas in my own words, applying them to my own context, creating summary outlines, etc.): 5% or less
Although less than 5% of the sources I save go through more than 3 layers of compression, these sources are more valuable to me than all the rest put together.
In general, avoid the temptation to apply the same system everywhere. Not everything needs to scale.2. Pattern-matchingOur brains far outperform any supercomputer in finding and identifying patterns. You could say our minds are optimized for pattern recognition, which is why we do it quickly and effortlessly.
The note-taking system we create should enable this type of thinking by exposing semantic triggers, not fight against it by burying the most important points in a massive wall o’ text.
Here’s a recent piece by Haley Thurston, where one pass was enough to extract the point:

See how that one phrase jumps out at you, even at this zoomed out elevation?
It will likewise jump out at me if, 6 months from now, I come across this note and need to judge whether it’s worth reading in 5 seconds or less. If the key words in this highlighted phrase match the pattern of the problem I’m working on, I will start by reading the paragraph in which it’s found. If it still matches, I’ll read the rest of the note. If this ends up being a critical piece of the puzzle I’m solving, I’ll click the link and revisit the whole piece. The attention I’m willing to spend has to be justified upfront.
There’s a reason we want to keep all these "layers" within a single note, by the way, instead of, say, creating a master note containing "key points" from various sources: often, the keywords you’ll search for won’t actually be in the "best parts" you’ve highlighted.
A profound quote on productivity very often won’t actually contain the word "productivity." But the surrounding text is much more likely to contain these "meta-descriptive" words; thus, every word in the entire document serves as "tags" that increase the likelihood of turning it up.3. SimpleNotice how simple this system is. There are just a few loose formatting guidelines, and only one rule: spend more time/attention on things that interest and resonate with you.
As David Allen says,Simple, clear purposes and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.There are ways you could make this system more "optimized," but at the cost of metastasizing complexity. The best system is the one you stick to.4. SituatedCompressing your notes in this way has an interesting effect: it makes them more valuable to you, but less valuable to others. In other words, this information is highly "situated" in your mental context.
That’s because progressively identifying and highlighting the "best parts" based on an extremely subjective measure like "resonance" has the effect of making the information more legible to you, but less legible to others. You’ll find yourself picking out 2 sentences from a long article, whose relevance is only apparent to someone with your life experiences and "dozen favorite problems."
Have you ever read a book in which someone else has taken notes? The margin notes either don’t make sense, or their conclusions are totally obvious. Ever-notes are the new marginalia — the personal musings and insights of a unique mind — extracted from paper and indexed for maximum searchability.
This "situated" phenomenon gives rise to a wonderful paradox: I believe my Evernote database is my single greatest business asset, the sum total of my best thinking over years, yet if someone stole it in its entirety it would be of little use to them. This not only is comforting in an insecure digital world, but allows me to do something otherwise unthinkable: share my most valuable notes.
I share them in blog posts (like this one), in projects with clients, and often send them to people I know are tackling a problem for which a source I’ve compressed would be useful. It becomes almost like a personal Wikipedia of learnings I can selectively share to create value for others, while preserving the highest value (the connections to other notes) for myself.5. Self-OrganizingThere’s another, less obvious quality of this system: it is self-organizing.
I said previously that the purpose of Evernote is to "track how much attention has been paid to a given note." But even this tracking shouldn’t be done explicitly. We humans don’t do well on consistency, thus any system that requires us to use tags to explicitly "track" how much attention has been applied (i.e. Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3) is bound to fail.
Instead, use the appearance of the note itself to tell you how much attention has been applied. Just like ants don’t try to remember the path to food — they leave pheromone trails to guide their efforts and others’ — imprint your progress on the terrain itself, allowing your future self to pick up instantly where you left off, whether it was yesterday or a year ago.
In this system, I know that any source with notes attached is at Layer 1, any bolded parts indicate Layer 2, and any highlights indicate Layer 3. As long as I stay consistent with this much simpler and more natural system, I’ll know how much thinking has been done at any point in the future.
Evernote gives us a second brain by allowing us to distribute our thinking across two brains, instead of one. It doesn’t matter that this second brain is nowhere near as smart as your original one — by following the principles of self-organizing systems, you gain the benefits of collective intelligence: "adaptivity, autonomy and robustness."In the FleshLet’s "compress" these 4 characteristics of our system back into one more tangible example:

That is 1,682 words at Layer 0 (the original article I read), compressed down to 65 words at Layer 1 (my copy-and-pasted notes), compressed to 11 words at Layer 2 (bolded), and 8 words at Layer 3 (highlighted). And it probably makes zero sense to you.
But it makes instant sense to me, because it directly addresses one of my "dozen favorite problems," a question I’ve been pondering for some time: What are values? Its relevance is fully situated in my mental context.
Reading this paragraph made a lightbulb go off in my head: "values" are "descriptive normative rules," whereas "criteria" are "prescriptive normative rules." Not gonna change my life, but it lends just a little extra clarity to my thinking. By the way, look at how many different words in the surrounding text would turn up in a search:Thomas Kuhn, history of science, theory choice, scientific community, varied interpretations, account of scienceDo you see how I would never be able to come up with a universal system of tags or notebooks to describe all conceivable connections?The PointI started my career as a productivity coach, giving 1-on-1 advice to help people improve their productivity.
I used to think my job was to give people the "right" productivity tip. I maintained databases of such tips and tricks and hacks, like a pharmacist cataloging elixirs. In fact, this is how I started using Evernote. I was convinced that if I could just give each person the right medicine, I could "fix" their problem.
But over time I noticed something: people fail to be productive not because they lack a critical piece of information; they fail because they don’t see themselves as productive people. It is a self-reinforcing loop.
I realized my role was actually to change self-narratives, to help people design and carry out small experiments in narrowly defined areas to prove to themselves they could believe a different story about themselves. Because once they believe a different story, they have the energy and confidence to seek out all the practical methods and tools for themselves.
I was struck by a recent study, described by NPR’s Alix Spiegel, that illustrated the power of self-narratives: it showed that hotel maids, when informed about how their typical daily movements burned a significant number of calories, actually showed improved blood pressure and weight loss compared to a control group.
It wasn’t that they started working harder: the researchers concluded that their bodies actually changed their functioning in response to the changed perceptions.
Start believing that you’re exercising, even without changing your behavior, and you actually will be. This is exactly what we’re using Evernote for: if you start acting like you are creative, your body and mind will respond, and you will be. Start acting like every idea you come across or come up with has the potential for brilliance, and that potential is more likely to be realized.
Creativity can be practiced. It is a skill that can be improved and cultivated, an acquired taste that increases exponentially in value over time.
And it’s a necessity, not a luxury.
Richard Hamming put it this way:"I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don’t quite know what problems are worth working on… He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. … [T]here is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder."That is next-level productivity right there. Knowing not only how to get things done, but what is worth doing in the first place.
There’s a last quality of self-organizing, adaptive systems, like the one we’re creating here, that I want to highlight: they have the tendency to coalesce around "attractors," stable regimes of activity that seem to "pull" the actions of agents toward them.
I’ve noticed this phenomenon as a sort of "emergent intelligence" my notes exhibit. They seem to pop up at serendipitous times, to seek each other out across boundaries, to conspire together to push my thinking in certain directions. It’s almost like my Evernote database has its own beliefs, its own conclusions. You could even say, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.
What’s most interesting about attractors is that they function identically to goals or intentions. They organize diverse means toward coherent ends, creating order out of disorder. In fact, the well-established "order from noise" principle states that the more random variation ("noise") such a system is exposed to, the faster it will self-organize.
In other words, don’t pursue goals; instead create systems that encourage attractors to emerge on their own. With such a system in place, the more chaotic your environment, the more randomness and uncertainty you are exposed to, the faster you will be propelled to interesting places, as long as you’re open to wherever that may lead.

February 3rd, 2019
 
I. Loan application

Before serving time for mortgage fraud, Toby Groves seemed like the last person who would get into that kind of trouble. His older brother had been sentenced for the same crime twenty years earlier, and Toby had seen how it destroyed his family. He swore he’d never make a similar mistake.

Then in 2003, the company he’d founded ran into problems. Out of a sense of responsibility to his employees and their families, Toby took out a loan on his own house to make up the shortfall. He realized that he wouldn’t get the loan if he told the truth about his income on the loan application. So he boosted the number by a bit, thinking it was a short term fix. He thought, "If I just fudge the number a little, I’ll fix this big problem. I’ll save the company, save jobs."

But it was not just a short term fix. He soon needed more money to save his business, so he fraudulently documented a loan for a made-up house and use those funds to pay off the first loan. He couldn’t do it by himself — he needed help from his staff and even other companies to pull it off. When he asked for their help, not one of them said "no". They didn’t see it as a crime, but rather as helping a friend out of a tight spot.

When two FBI agents showed up at Toby’s office, he quickly confessed everything. He says he was relieved.

No one ever stopped and said "I’m uncomfortable doing this". The stakes grew ever higher until he realized he was in too deep. When the FBI showed up at his office in 2006, Toby quickly confessed, just glad that it was all finally over.

Toby Groves didn’t wake up one day and decide to pull off a $7 million mortgage fraud. He took the first step out of duty towards his employees, and each subsequent step between that moment and his final undoing felt like a natural progression. It was only when he looked back that he fully grasped what he had done.

 
II. Ordinary citizens

American textbooks usually portray Nazis as psychopaths in uniform. But the reality was far more horrifying — ordinary German citizens carried out most of the tasks that made the Holocaust possible.

Historians point out that "the inefficient and overburdened Nazi regime depended on the support, indeed the active collaboration, of the citizenry for its survival". They argue that it was more bottom-up than top-down, pointing to Hitler’s widespread popularity and to the depressingly few instances of overt resistance as evidence. This apparatus of terror may have centered on the Gestapo, but it depended on the compliance of German citizens.

These "ordinary" individuals took part for reasons that were far more complex. Some wanted to gain social status, while others simply feared they would be shot if they did not comply. Still others welcomed the strong national bond with their ethnic group after decades of misery and global humiliation.

Others didn’t even fully realize what was happening until it was too late. In the beginning, many of the acts encouraged by the Gestapo seemed justified, or at least justifiable. They started by cracking down on political extremists. The focus on Socialists and Communists gave onlookers plausible deniability. These people posed a direct threat to the state, and some were violent, so few questioned the Gestapo’s right to use force to stop them.


Another typical day in Berlin, 1940

The Gestapo then targeted Jehovah’s Witnesses, because they were unwilling to accept the authority of the military. This seemed like a natural extension of the earlier persecution of political extremists, so again the injustice was mostly overlooked. Sure, the Witnesses insisted that they were apolitical, but they refused to give the Nazi salute, to allow their children to join the Hitler Youth, or to be drafted, so they threatened the stability of the Reich.

Trade unionists were next. The labor movement exercised significant political power, representing a barrier to Nazi control over all areas of life. Again, the regime met little resistance from its citizenry. From there, the Gestapo continued to expand their reach. Over time, they rounded up groups for whom the argument that they might threaten the Reich was increasingly tenuous, but by then it was too late. The Nazis had consolidated their power.

By "methodically singling out particular groups of victims and going after them with every pretense of legality", the Nazis’ incrementally increasing atrocities boiled the frog. The Gestapo began their repression by targeting those who were most widely considered criminals and trouble makers. It was hard to disagree with that. And even if you did disagree, it wasn’t exactly a popular cause to support them. By the time innocent women and children were being rounded up, the German populace was already in too deep. Not only had repression been normalized, but any who did recognize the horrific reality stood little chance of reversing the momentum working in favor of the regime.

After the war, Germans were humiliated by the atrocities of the Holocaust. Citizens were appalled when confronted with the harsh reality with which they had complied, and they responded with the idea that Germany above all has a mission to prevent anything similar happening ever again. Schools spend a lot of time teaching about the Nazi era, and patriotism is taboo. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is visible from the Reichstag parliament building in Berlin, intended as a reminder to the country’s leaders of its tragic past.

The Holocaust was antithetical to the values of most Germans. And yet somehow, it still happened.

 
III. Psychological framing

There is a lot of interesting research on how framing affects decision-making around ethical questions.

In one study out of Cornell University, researchers found that framing can affect the type of decision a person perceives (s)he is making. This can cause people to overlook the ethical dimensions of their decision. Max Bazerman and Ann Tenbrunsel describe the study:Participants were asked to play the role of a manufacturer in an industry known for emitting toxic gas... The manufacturers had reached a voluntary but costly agreement to run equipment that would limit ... toxic emissions. Some participants were told they would face modest financial sanctions if they broke the agreement; others were told they would face no sanctions if they did.An economic analysis would predict that the threat of sanctions would increase compliance with the agreement. Instead, participants who faced a potential fine cheated more, not less, than those who faced no sanctions. With no penalty, the situation was construed as an ethical dilemma; the penalty caused individuals to view the decision as a financial one.In another study, Harvard researchers found evidence that people are more likely to accept increasingly major infractions "as long as each violation is only incrementally more serious than the preceding one". At the same time, people are more likely to recognize and stop unethical behavior of the same magnitude when the change is "abrupt". A Harvard Business Review article described:Bazerman and the Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino explored this in an experiment in which the participants — "auditors" — were asked to decide whether to approve guesses provided by "estimators" of the amount of money in jars. The auditors could earn a percentage of a jar’s contents each time they approved an estimator’s guess — and thus had an incentive to approve high estimates — but if they were caught approving an exaggerated estimate, they’d be fined $5.Over the course of 16 rounds, the estimates rose to suspiciously high levels either incrementally or abruptly; all of them finished at the same high level. The researchers found that auditors were twice as likely to approve the high final estimates if they’d been arrived at through small incremental increases. The slippery-slope change blinded them to the estimators’ dishonesty.And another study out of Case Western found that in interpersonal conflicts, the victim and perpetrator have different subjective interpretations. Charles Stangor described this study and the tendency for individuals to judge others more harshly and conclusively than themselves:The researchers analyzed the accounts people gave of an experience they identified where they angered someone else (i.e. when they were the perpetrator of a behavior leading to an unpleasant outcome) and another one where someone else angered them (i.e. they were the victim).The differences in attributions made in these two situations were considerable. When accounting for themselves as perpetrators, people tended to emphasize situational factors to describe their behavior as an isolated incident that was a meaningful, understandable response to the situation, and to assert that the action caused no lasting harm. When they were the victims, on the other hand, they explained the perpetrator’s behavior by focusing on the presumed character defects of the person and by describing the behavior as an arbitrary and senseless action, taking place in an ongoing context of abusive behavior that caused lasting harm to them as victims.
The differences in the framing in each of the examples above are ethically neutral*:The effect on the environment of toxic gas remains the same, regardless of any fine imposed on the company or not; if anything, the monetary cost should weight the ethics on the side of the "correct" behavior, because of the leadership’s fiduciary duty to their shareholders.The dollar amount dishonestly acquired in the jar audit remains the same, regardless of the past guesses.And the same action that angered one person should have the same moral weight as the same action victimizing another. Yet the decision maker is more likely to accept or even perpetuate an unethical outcome under certain supposedly equivalent circumstances.
We’ve all seen this kind of inconsistent behavior. Just yesterday when I was biking down the street, a car nearly ran me over as it made a turn. I was pissed — what an idiot for not checking his blind spot! That’s one of the first things you learn about right hand turns! But if I think about it, I realize that I’ve made that exact mistake before while driving, resulting in a near-miss with a cyclist. I didn’t drive away thinking that I was an idiot driver. Rather, the thought was "Thank goodness that one-time mistake didn’t turn out badly… maybe I should get some coffee on my way to class, I guess I must be tired".

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many ways we can trick ourselves into evaluating equivalent ethical decisions differently. Our evaluation can change depending on who is responsible, the context in which it happened, and what our reference points were. Of course these effects do not absolve the decision maker of his responsibility, but they are often disregarded when we judge history. These judgements then constrain the range of ethical actions of which we perceive ourselves to be capable, misleading ourselves into thinking we could never do terrible things.

 
Most suffering is not inflicted by an evil mastermind. When things go wrong, it’s usually because regular people take part. We underestimate how misguided intentions, counterproductive framing, and imperfect information can lead an ordinary person to do extraordinarily bad things.

History is messy, especially while it’s happening. If we simplify the story and write off those involved as lone villains, we risk making the same mistakes. When we view events as a simple morality play, we lose our ability to learn from the past.

We are all capable of behaving profoundly unethically, even when our intentions are good. It’s too easy to dismiss people who do bad things as corrupt or malicious. It’s important to remember that given the right set of circumstances, we too might make wrong choices.

History is too often reduced to stories of good versus evil. We get the impression that we are somehow different from the people who were bad, and we take for granted that we would never make similar choices. We should learn to empathize with those who make terrible choices — not to pardon their choices nor to deny ourselves the right to grieve, but to recognize when we might be heading down a similar path. If we see them as people and understand where they went wrong, we can avoid making the same mistakes.
 

* This is at least my view. You could of course give greater moral weight to your own personal sphere (i.e. you value utility for yourself, your family, and your friends more than for strangers), or you could believe something odd like the delta in behavior from some precedent is what’s morally relevant ("Well, he’s a little bit better than he used to be…"). But for the purpose of this essay, I’m going to consider the pairs of cases in the studies mentioned as ethically equivalent.

March 17th, 2018

I love the feeling of building up a mental map of a once-unfamiliar place. Last week I traveled to several cities that I’d never visited before (Beijing, Saigon, Singapore, Jakarta, and Bangalore), so March has been full of this sensation. I joked with friends that I was "training my neural net". I’d read a lot about two of the cities (Beijing, Singapore), knew a bit about one (Saigon), and knew close to nothing about the others (Jakarta, Bangalore). Now, I feel quite confident that given a photo of a street from one of these places I could name the metropolitan region with a low error rate. My internalized representation of each of these places is certainly not complete, but it’s much better than it was a week ago.

I’ve also filled in some of my knowledge gaps about the economics and history of these places. The best part is that I made some friends in each city, and they’ve been drowning me with interesting local sources since I left. It was a productive, fun, and eye-opening trip!

However, my memory is a sieve. I took copious notes, photos, and videos of each place, luckily. I also found interesting articles, read several books, and had interesting conversations that taught me more about the places I visited. 

I’ll be posting a consolidated write-up of each place over the next week or two in order to retain the experiences (and to share them, since you might find them interesting).

March 12th, 2018
I originally gave this talk at Typescript Conference 2018. You can find the slides here.

TypeScript is a godsend for Webpack and Ethereum developers. In the nascent world of smart contracts, developer-friendly tooling is almost non-existent, the only error message is VM Exception: revert, and bugs can cost millions of dollars. Meanwhile, most Webpack config files are incomprehensible, fragile, and cobbled together from a mess of Stack Overflow answers and legacy code.

These problems are particularly frustrating for Typescript developers accustomed to a powerful type system. The good news is that there's nothing stopping us from applying this type system to notoriously complex, opaque tools like Webpack and Ethereum. Doing so will make your code more robust, testable, and comprehensible. TypeScript lets us encode and share developer knowledge, pin down easy-to-misuse interfaces, and generally add a layer of sanity between us and the tools we use.

Context
7 months ago, a cryptocurrency project called REXmls lost $6 million worth of Ethereum. The root cause was a single line of code. Webpack is another tool that is notoriously complex.

=== why-do-home-buyers-look-at-price-sqft-more-than-renters.html === Why do home buyers look at price/sqft more than renters?
 Why do home buyers look at price/sqft more than renters?
                  Why do home buyers look at price/sqft more than renters?
                  

January 9th, 2023
A question that's puzzled me for a while is why home buyers focus on price/sqft so much more than renters. I asked around for what other people thought and got some interesting answers, so I decided to write up my takeaways.
I. Investments demand legibilityHomeownership is an investment and consumption good, while renting is just a consumption good. As a result, buyers are forced to think of it in more legible ways as opposed to just an amenity bundle.

For buyers, a house serves as both a personal residence and also an asset that can be sold for a profit later on. As as a result, buyers tend to be more concerned with how the market values the property, and how much it might be worth when it comes time to sell.

The mechanics of buying and selling homes basically force you to consider price/sqft:When you sell, the realtor you hire will figure out how much it can sell for buy looking at "comps", comparisons to similar properties that have sold in the area.When you buy, the bank will determine how much to lend you based on an appraisal, which in turn is done in terms of comps and price/sqft.
Realtors, banks, institutional investors, and appraisers do this because they need a way to understand where the house sits as fungible asset among the market. Price/sqft makes a home more abstract and fungible, enabling them to boil down a unique asset to a small set of dimensions that can be sorted in a spreadsheet.

Renters generally care only about how much they personally value the property, rather than its long-term value or how others will perceive its value. They are focused on finding a place that meets their immediate needs and budget and tend to think about a property as a total amenity bundle: how many bedrooms/bathrooms, how close to work, whether there's a balcony, how nice the kitchen is, etc. They do care about spaciousness, but it's one of many aspects of the property that they look at.

II. Owners renovate more than rentersHomebuyers see square footage as a blank canvas that can be transformed to fit their needs and preferences, while renters are less able or willing to renovate their space. Landlords tend to be conservative about how much a tenant can change their space, so having extra square footage that's poorly used doesn't add much value to the renter. Even if the landlord is open to the tenant modifying the unit, renters are less motivated to invest as much in renovations since the value goes back to the landlord rather than to the renters themselves.

Side note: This dynamic is totally different in commercial leasing. In that context, tenant buildout and modification of the space is often taken as a given, and the price/sqft is often the headline advertised number. When the market is soft, commercial lease negotiations can even include concessions from the landlord to pay for some of the improvements chosen by the tenant.

 
III. Sqft is less accurate for rentalsSquare footage is a more reliable metric for measuring the usable space of single-family houses, whose layouts tend to have fewer constraints. It is not as accurate for measuring the usable space of rental units because they tend to have more irregular floor plans. This is especially true for apartments, which may have odd shapes or unusable space due to the need to fit a large number of units into a small area or because they are located in a converted building. 

IV. Rentals rarely list square footage, while sales listings almost always doAnother reason why renters might pay less attention to price/sqft is because rental listings rarely list it. Meanwhile, sale listings almost always include price/sqft. Of course the causality may run the other way – maybe the listings don't include those metrics because people don't care – but I'm sure that if landlords started highlighting price/sqft, renters would pay marginally more attention to those metrics.

V. Renters are more likely in survival modePeople who are just trying to survive are more likely to rent than to buy, because they tend to have less access to capital and cash flow. This means they are going for whatever they can afford, not trying to optimize. Meanwhile buyers are considering between different investments. Buyers also likely have more options to begin with, and metrics like price/sqft are only really useful as a comparison point between multiple options.

VI. Renting just isn't as important a decision as buyingThe simplest answer might just be that renting just isn't such a big deal, while buying a home is often the single biggest financial decision a person will make in their their life. Renting is typically just a 6-18 month lease, while buying ties you to the asset until you can sell. As a result, you just don't take the decision as seriously and thus look at fewer metrics.

People are even less likely to look at the price/sqft of a hotel rooms, because it's a much lower impact decision in the first place if you're only there for a few days. Some renters know the price/sqft, but I've never heard of any travelers cite the nightly price/sqft of a hotel room.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my Twitter thread, especially Brian Potter for spending extra time talking me through some of these ideas.

 Visual Technology

                  Visual Technology
                  

February 25th, 2016
Technology enables us to see the world in ways that are inaccessible to our natural senses. In opening these new worlds to us, it encourages introspection and discovery, inflates our cosmic egos, and then puts us back in our place.

Discovery of perspective
Visual technology plays a key role in human cognition and our sense of self. One primitive example is the mirror, which literally enables self reflection. Mirrors are so deeply ingrained in our conscious that they are part of its definition. The mirror test—the ability to recognize one's own reflection—is a common method for determining whether an animal possesses self awareness, cognition, and social identity.


The mirror is a simple reminder that our understanding of reality is incomplete and subjective. This simple device trains us to step outside of our usual place to see ourselves from a different perspective. Lewis Mumford argued that the introduction of high quality mirrors played a major role in the rise of self-examining work in the Renaissance. He credited newly-enabled "mirror conversations" for Rembrandt's self portraits, the expanding genres of confessional novels and autobiographical writing, and a general preoccupation with one's image.

Mirrors advanced our understanding of the natural world as well as of ourselves. The first Renaissance perspective drawings relied on the use of a mirror, a technique discovered by 15th century Italian artist Filippo Brunelleschi. Filarete, one of his contemporaries, described the benefits of this tool:

If you should desire to represent something in another, easier way, take a mirror and hold it up in front of the thing you want to do. Look into it, and you will see the outlines of the thing more easily, and whatever is closer or further will appear foreshortened to you.

Inspired by Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti further embraced the rules of geometry with his gridded window. Linear perspective had been an obscure branch of theoretical mathematics, but with Alberti's invention, it quickly became an important tool in realist art.It also played a key role in the then-emerging modern science. For hundreds of years, medieval astronomers had been puzzled by the light and dark patches on the moon, unable to even identify them as topography. Just a generation later, Galileo used the rules of perspective to accurately estimate the depth of these mountains and craters.

Due to Galileo's training in Renaissance art and an understanding of chiaroscuro (a technique for shading light and dark) he quickly understood that the shadows he was seeing were actually mountains and craters. From his sketches, he made estimates of their heights and depths.
— Galileo and the Telescope


Creation and a god complex
Cameras are a spiritual descendant of these earlier optical inventions. They are yet another extension of our senses. Marta Braun explained, "Instantaneous photography of moving objects established a world that is unavailable to our vision—a world that is beyond the reach of our senses."

In the late 1800s, Eadweard Muybridge's stop-motion photographs famously answered a hotly-debated question of the day: are all four hooves ever off the ground at the same time in a horse's gallop? The human eye cannot distinguish the blur of the gait as a series separate movements, but Muybridge's photographic studies proved that all four hooves do indeed come off the ground simultaneously mid-stride.However, photography is not simply another iteration in our understanding of reality. It is a superpower that allows us to control time. Cameras gave us the power to capture a moment—to freeze it, share it, and study it at will. Further advancements brought us the time lapse, slow motion video, and long exposure photography, allowing us to capture the world on timescales inaccessible to our natural senses. (I love Michael Nielsen’s term for this: super-realism.)


The camera is not the only technology that has extended art beyond representations of the existing world. Photoshop allows us to modify the world around us or create entirely new worlds from scratch. Artists like Dan Luvisi create entire photorealistic worlds that otherwise couldn't exist. These tools enable us to mold worlds according to our fantasies, allowing us to play god.

As we live more of our lives online and through abstract representations, the illusions we create become all the more important. Visual media are no longer just representations of some outer world; increasingly, they are our entire world. And as its creators, we have developed a growing sense of self-importance and invincibility. Technology offers the tools to both understand and engineer reality, and over time that has fueled a god complex within humans. It is a major feature of modern, post-Enlightenment thought that progress is inevitable. Science historian George Sarton argued in 1936 that "the acquisition and systematization of positive knowledge is ... cumulative", and as a result human knowledge can only expand to infinity.

A dash of cosmic perspective
The great irony is that visual media is a powerful way to communicate just how insignificant we really are. When the Hubble Space Telescope was pointed into the deep field, a sliver of space thought to be void of stars and planets, the resulting images were illuminated by light from over three thousand galaxies. Images from Voyager 1 gave us another perspective on our place in the universe. At a distance 6 billion kilometers from home, the spacecraft captured an image of the earth famously described by Carl Sagan as "a pale blue dot":

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

— Carl Sagan
This strange dichotomy is the defining attribute of our relationship with visual representation. It gives us the tools necessary to make discoveries and empowers us to bend spacetime—or at least our perception of it. At the same time, it is a reminder that we still have so many more mysteries to unravel.#tools-for-thoughtKeep in touch!

August 22nd, 2018
I gave in to my paranoid tendencies today and wrote a little backup script for Twitter, which I figured I'd share here.

Two requirements: github.com/sferik/t: A command-line power tool for Twittergithub.com/wireservice/csvkit: A suite of utilities for converting to and working with CSV, the king of tabular file formats
To install these from the terminal:Here's the script to do the backup itself (which I plan to run ~1/mo):For some reason it's only retrieving ~3,000 of my tweets (when I have 5,000+). From a quick perusal of the web, several people mentioned that Twitter has limited this API to just 3,200 results. Bummer! Should still work for most folks, plus I like the CSV format.

You can also retrieve a full backup by going to your Account Settings and requesting "Your Tweet Archive" at the bottom. It gives you a nice little viewer too! And this one gives you all of your tweets, not just the last 3,000. 🙂 I like having both formats.

I teach at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), where the student population is about evenly divided between technologists who care about aesthetics and artists who aren't afraid of machines, which makes it a pretty good place to see the future.

Part of the future I believe I'm seeing is a change in the software ecosystem which, for the moment, I'm calling  annotation start situated software. This is software designed in and for a particular social situation or context. This way of making software is in contrast with what I'll call the Web School (the paradigm I learned to program in), where scalability, generality, and completeness were the key virtues.
 annotation end 
I see my students cheerfully ignoring Web School practices and yet making interesting work, a fact that has given me persistent cognitive dissonance for a year, so I want to describe the pattern here, even in its nascent stages, to see if other people are seeing the same thing elsewhere.

Users By The Dozens
 We've always had a tension between enterprise design practices
and a  annotation start "small pieces, loosely joined" way of making software annotation end , to use
David Weinberger's felicitous phrase. The advantages to the latter are
in part described in Worse is
Better and The
Cathedral and the Bazaar.  annotation start Situated software is in the small pieces
category, with the following additional characteristic --
it is
designed for use by a specific social group, rather than for a generic
set of "users" annotation end .

The biggest difference this creates relative to classic web applications is that it becomes easy to build  annotation start applications to be used by dozens of users, an absurd target population in current design practice annotation end . Making form-fit software for a small group of users has typically been the province of banks and research labs -- because of the costs involved, Web School applications have concentrated on getting large-scale audiences. And  annotation start by privileging the value that comes with scale, Web School applications put other kinds of value, particularly social value, out of reach annotation end .

We've been killing conversations about software with "That won't scale" for so long we've forgotten that scaling problems aren't inherently fatal. The N-squared problem is only a problem if N is large, and in social situations, N is usually not large. A reading group works better with 5 members than 15; a seminar works better with 15 than 25, much less 50, and so on.

This in turn gives  annotation start software form-fit to a particular group a number of desirable characteristics -- it's cheaper and faster to build, has fewer issues of scalability, and likelier uptake by its target users annotation end . It also has several obvious downsides, including less likelihood of use outside its original environment, greater brittleness if it is later called on to handle larger groups, and a potentially shorter lifespan.

I see my students making some of these tradeoffs, though, because the kinds of scarcities the Web School was meant to address -- the expense of adequate hardware, the rarity of programming talent, and the sparse distribution of potential users -- are no longer the constraints they once were.

Teachers on the Run

The first inkling I got that the Web School rationale might be weakening was an application written by two of my former students, Paul Berry and Keren Merimeh. In November of 2002, as a project for a class on the feeling of online spaces called Social Weather, they created an application called (alarmingly) Teachers on the Run.

Teachers on the Run was essentially HotorNot for ITP professors, to allow students to describe and rate us in advance of spring course registration. Every professor was listed in a database; students could come by anonymously and either enter a comment about a professor or cast a vote agreeing or disagreeing with an earlier comment. The descriptions were sorted in vote total order, so that a +5 description (5 more students had agreed than disagreed) was displayed higher than a +2 or a -3. And that was it -- a list of names, a list of comments, click to vote, and a simple sorting algorithm.

They launched it on a Friday. By Saturday night, another student called me at home to tell me I'd better take a look at it. There are only 200 or so students at ITP, but Teachers on the Run had already accumulated hundreds of comments, most positive, some negative, a few potentially libelous. More importantly, though, there had been over a thousand votes in 24 hours. By Monday morning, I had students telling me they knew what was on the site, not because they'd seen it, but because it had been the only topic of conversation over the weekend.

The curious thing to me about Teachers on the Run was that it worked where the Web School version failed. RateMyProfessors.com has been available for years, with a feature set that put the simplistic write/read/vote capabilities of Teachers on the Run to shame. Yet no one at ITP had ever bothered to use RateMyProfessors.com, though the weekend's orgy of rating and voting demonstrated untapped demand.

Despite the social energy it unleashed, I missed the importance of Teachers on the Run.  annotation start I told myself that it had succeeded for a number of reasons that were vaguely unfair: The users knew the programmers; the names database had been populated in advance; the programmers could use the in-house mailing list to launch the application annotation end  rather than trying to get attention through press releases and banner ads. Most damning of all, it wouldn't scale, the sine qua non of successful Web applications. DOA, QED.

Then I saw the design process my most recent class went through.

The Class

In a class called Social Software, which I taught last fall, the students worked in small groups to design and launch software  annotation start to support some form of group interaction annotation end . To anchor the class, I required that whatever project they came up with be used by other ITP students. This first order benefits of this strategy were simple: the designers came from the same population as the users, and  annotation start could thus treat their own instincts as valid annotation end ; beta-testers could be recruited by walking down the hall; and  annotation start it kept people from grandiose "boil the ocean" attempts annotation end .

What I hadn't anticipated was the second-order benefits. Time and again the groups came up against problems that they solved in part by taking advantage of social infrastructure or context-sensitive information that wouldn't be available to adherents of the Web School. Two strategies in particular stand out.
 The first had to do with reputation systems. One project, The
Orderer (designed by Vena Chitturi, Fa-yi Chou, Rachel Fishman, and Cindy
Yang) was for coordinating group restaurant orders, common in
late-night work sessions. The other, WeBe (Brandon Brown, Yoonjung
Kim, Olivier Massot, Megan Phalines) was a tool for coordinating
group purchases of things like chips or motors. Because money was
involved, a Web School approach would require some way of dealing with
the threat of non-payment, using things like pre-pay or escrow accounts, or formal
reputation systems.

Instead, in both projects the students decided that since all the users were part of the ITP community, they would simply make it easy to track the deadbeats, with the threat of public broadcast of their names.  annotation start The possibility of being shamed in front of the community became part of the application design, even though the community and the putative shame were outside the framework of the application itself. annotation end 

Communal Attention

The other strategy had to do with communal attention. Two other projects, Scout (Karen Bonna, Christine Brumback, Dennis Crowley, Alex Rainert) and CoDeck (Mark Argo, Dan Melinger, Shawn Van Every, Ahmi Wolf) ended up being situated in the community in a more literal fashion. Scout indicates physical presence, by allowing students to register themselves as being present somewhere on the ITP floor, and displaying that information. CoDeck is a community-based video server, designed to allow video artists to share and comment on each other's work.

Both groups had the classic problem of notification -- getting a user to tune in requires interrupting their current activity, not something users have been known to relish. Billions were spent on Web School applications that assumed users would bookmark for a return visit, or would happily accept email alerts, but despite a few well-publicized successes like Schwab.com and eBay, users have mostly refused to "check back often."

Both Scout and CoDeck hit on the same solution: take most of the interface off the PC's dislocated screen, and move it into a physical object in the lounge, the meeting place/dining room/foosball emporium in the center of the ITP floor. Scout and CoDeck each built kiosks in the lounge with physical interfaces in lieu of keyboard/mouse interaction. Scout used a bar code reader to swipe in; CoDeck gutted a mid-70's BetaMax chassis and put a Linux machine inside, then used the BetaMax buttons to let the user control the video stream. Both Scout and CoDeck have web sites where users can enter or retrieve data, but the core piece of each is location in physical space that puts the application in a social context.

These projects all took the course's original dictum -- the application must be useful to the community -- and began to work with its corollary as well --  annotation start the community must be useful to the application annotation end .

Group Capabilities

We constantly rely on the cognitive capabilities of individuals in software design -- we assume a user can associate the mouse with the cursor, or that icons will be informative. We rarely rely on the cognitive capabilities of groups, however, though we rely on those capabilities in the real world all the time.

In brainstorming sessions, a group can generate not just more ideas but more kinds of ideas than the same individuals working in isolation, and a group consensus is often more accurate than the guess of the group's most knowledgeable individual. Groups also know a lot about themselves. People in work groups know who to go to for design advice, or who is unreliable in a pinch, without any formal designation of those roles. Members of social groups know who it's fun to go drinking with or who you shouldn't lend money to (often the same person) without needing that knowledge to be spelled out in a FAQ.

Web School software ignores this kind of knowledge, because it is hard to make explicit. On most large mailing lists, for example, only a handful of posters start discussions, while most posters simply follow-up; and, at a higher level, only a handful of the members post at all, while a most simply lurk. We've known about these patterns for decades, but mailing list software still does not offer any features specific to starting vs. continuing threads, nor does it treat high-volume posters and lurkers differently.

There is another strategy, however, analogous to asking the user to recognizing icons; the designer can simply assume the group has a certain capability, without needing to recapitulate it in code. If you have an uncollected payment in a communal buying pool, the software can kick out a message that says "Deadbeat alert. Deal with it."  annotation start A real world group will have some way of handling the problem annotation end , usually through moral suasion or the threat of lost reputational capital, or even, in extreme cases, ostracism.

This is no different than what happens in offline groups every day, but the solution feels wrong, in Web School terms, because those web applications can't assume there is a tacit reputation system.  annotation start By relying on existing social fabric, situated software is guaranteed not to work at the scale Web School apps do, but for the same reason, it can work in ways Web School software can't. annotation end 

Outside Eyes

I finally started regarding situated software as a practical development strategy, rather than as a degenerate case of "real" application development, when I invited outside reviewers into the Social Software class for a mid-term critique. These were all people who work with social software for a living, and the critique session was enormously valuable. Two of the recommendations made by the reviewers, however, struck me funny.

The first was the suggestion, made to the CoDeck group, that they should make all the features of their video tool available over the web -- upload, download, comment, and so on. The second recommendation was an exhortation to the WeBe group that they should look at Web School group-buying sites like Mercata and MobShop as guides to their own work.

This was the moment for me when cognitive dissonance finally became unsupportable.  annotation start Each of those comments was a) exactly what I would have said, had I been an outside reviewer in someone else's class, and b) obviously wrong, given the problem the respective groups were attacking. annotation end 

The suggestion about general web accessibility for the CoDeck interface came in the form of a rhetorical question -- "Why not make it as broadly accessible as possible?" In the Web School, of course, the answer is "No reason", since more users are always A Good Thing, but for CoDeck there were several good reasons for not simply turning their project into a Web video app.

First,  annotation start the physicalization of the interface, using the gutted BetaMax deck, provides a communal affordance that it is impossible to replicate over the web annotation end . Second, since CoDeck serves a tight community, the density of communication among ITP video makers would be diluted by general accessibility. Third,  annotation start having the video deck in the lounge makes it self-policing; the cohesion of the community keeps it largely free from abuse, whereas a generally accessible and password-free "upload and critique" video site would become a cesspool of porn within hours annotation end . Finally, serving a local community maximizes use of free bandwidth on the local network, enabling features that would saddle a public system with crippling costs.

WeBe Small 

Similarly, the recommendation that WeBe should look at Mercata and MobShop carried with it the  annotation start assumption that the goal should eventually be to operate at large scale annotation end . However, Mercata and MobShop failed because they were built to scale.

Those sites required a virtuous circle, where more users meant more savings meant more users. Alas, the thought that somewhere, someone else was saving a bundle on Tupperware was never enough to attract users, and without critical mass, the virtuous circle turned vicious. Like RateMyProfessors.com, the mere existence of a Web School app wasn't enough, and having been built for tens of thousands of users, it couldn't operate for dozens or even hundreds.

WeBe, on the other hand, was copying a small-scale pattern they first observed when a fellow student, Scott Fitzgerald, orchestrated a 30-license discount purchase of Max, the multi-media editing software. He used the ITP mailing list to recruit buyers, and then walked around the floor twisting arms and collecting checks.  annotation start This required real social fabric to work -- everyone knew and trusted Scott. annotation end 

As the instigator, Scott also benefited from the good karma -- everyone who participated saved quite a bit of money, enhancing his reputation.  annotation start Unlike actual capital, reputational capital is easier to accumulate in smaller and more closed social systems annotation end . The idea for WeBe came about in part because Scott said the purchase, though successful, had required too much work. Whatever the WeBe group could do to make ITP group purchases easier,  annotation start they didn't need to build identity or reputation systems. Because the software was situated in a particular (and particularly tight) community, they got those things for free. annotation end 

Old Scarcities Fade Away

Where the Web School works well, it works because it is the right kind of response to some sort of scarcity. There's scarcity of funds: Servers are expensive, not to mention load-balancing routers, tape backups, and the other accouterments of serious uptime. There's scarcity of talent: Good programmers are hard to find; great programmers are scarce as hen's teeth. And there's scarcity of use: Users are busy, they are creatures of habit, and there is significant competition for their attention.

However, addressing these scarcities can give Web School design a kind of merry-go-round quality. You need to scale because building a useful web application is so expensive, but much of the expense comes from the requirements of scale. Furthermore, these scarcities amplify one another: You need a big hardware budget to build an application that can scale, but you need good programmers and system administrators to handle the load, whose salaries require an increased marketing budget, to attract enough users to pay for it all.

What I think I'm seeing my students do is get off that ride. They can do this because none of the scarcities the Web School addresses are as significant as they used to be. First of all, Moore's Law and its equivalent for storage, plus the gradual improvement in operating systems, means that an $800 desktop machine can also be a pretty good server right out of the box.

Second, user attention was scarce in part because there were so few users at all.  annotation start In the 90's, launching an application on the Web meant forgoing any direct connection with a particular real world community, because internet users were spread thin annotation end , and  annotation start outside the IT industry, most real world groups had only a sub-set of members who were online annotation end .

Those days are ending, and in some places they are over already. In the US today, if you are under 35 or make over 35,000 dollars a year, you are probably online, and if both of those things are true, then most of the people you know are probably online as well.  annotation start You can now launch an application for a real world group, confident that all of them will have access to the internet. annotation end 

The Nature of Programming, and the Curious Case of MySQL

Finally, the practice of programming is changing. Gartner recently caused a stir by saying there would be 235,000 fewer programmers in the US ten years from now. This would have been like predicting in the 80s, that there would be fewer typists in the US by 2004. Such a prediction would be true in one sense -- the office typing pool has disappeared, and much data entry work has moved overseas. But actual typing, fingers hitting the keyboard, has not disappeared, it has spread everywhere.

So with programming; though all the attention is going to outsourcing, there's also a lot of  annotation start downsourcing going on, the movement of programming from a job description to a more widely practiced skill annotation end . If by programmer we mean "people who write code" instead of "people who are paid to write code", the number of programmers is going to go up, way up, by 2015, even though many of the people using perl and JavaScript and Flash don't think of themselves as programmers.

A variety of technologies are driving this -- perl, PHP, ActionScript, DHTML -- with a lot of mixing and matching and no one core tool, with one curious exception. Every application of this pattern I've seen has used a MySQL database.

There's an analogy here with web server software.  annotation start In the mid-90s, getting a web server running was such a messy endeavor that it was a project goal in and of itself. Then Apache came along annotation end , and so simplified the process that the web server became a simple building block for larger things.

MySQL does this for databases. This matters for the development of group applications, because the ability to sort is a public good. If Teachers on the Run had simply been a list of professors with attached comments, it would have been a write-only application, like those worthless "Tell us what you think!" comment forms on the bottom of news articles. One of the critical things any group wants to know is "What does everyone else think?", especially if there is reason to believe that the group in aggregate knows more than any individual. Adding the 'users rate comments' system, and then pulling the data out by rating instead of time, made the system valuable.

You can of course build these kind of features in other ways, but MySQL makes the job much easier, so much easier in fact that after MySQL, it becomes a different kind of job. There are complicated technical arguments for and against using MySQL vs. other databases, but none of those arguments matter anymore. For whatever reason, MySQL seems to be a core tool for this particular crop of new applications.

Software for Your Mom

Situated software isn't a technological strategy so much as an attitude about  annotation start closeness of fit between software and its group of users, and a refusal to embrace scale, generality or completeness as unqualified virtues annotation end . Seen in this light, the obsession with personalization of Web School software is an apology for the obvious truth --  annotation start most web applications are impersonal by design, as they are built for a generic user annotation end . Allowing the user to customize the interface of a Web site might make it more useful, but it doesn't make it any more personal than the ATM putting your name on the screen while it spits out your money.

Situated software, by contrast, doesn't need to be personalized -- it is personal from its inception. Teachers on the Run worked this way. Everyone knew that Paul and Keren built it. You could only rate Clay and Marianne and Tom and the other ITP professors. You didn't even know it even existed unless you were on the ITP mailing list. The application's lack of generality or completeness, in other words, communicated something -- "We built this for you" -- that the impersonal facade of RateMyProfessors.com doesn't have and can't fake.

One of my students mentioned building a web application for his
mother, a schoolteacher, to keep track of her class. If you were
working alone, unpaid, and in your spare time, there's no way you
could make an application that would satisfy the general and complete needs of schoolteachers everywhere. You could make one for your mom, though.

Small, purpose-built apps have always existed, of course --  annotation start learning BASIC used to be a rite of passage for PC owners annotation end , and data intensive institutions like investment banks and research labs write software for small groups of users. Now, though, the combination of good tools, talented users and the internet as a social stage makes the construction of such software simpler, the quality of the result better, and the delivery to the users as simple as clicking a link. The design center of a dozen users, so hard to serve in the past, may become normal practice.

What Next?

So what happens next? If what I'm seeing is not transitory or limited to a narrow set of situations, then we'll see a rise in these small  annotation start form-fit applications annotation end . This will carry some  annotation start obvious downsides, including tying the developers of such applications to community support roles, and shortening the useful lifespan of the software annotation end  made in this way.

 annotation start Expectations of longevity, though, are the temporal version of scale annotation end  -- we assume applications should work for long periods in part because it costs so much to create them. Once it's cheap and easy to throw together an application, though, that rationale weakens.  annotation start Businesses routinely ask teams of well-paid people to put hundreds of hours of work creating a single PowerPoint deck that will be looked at in a single meeting annotation end . The idea that software should be built for many users, or last for many years, are  annotation start cultural assumptions annotation end  not required by the software itself.

Indeed, as a matter of effect,  annotation start most software built for large numbers of users or designed to last indefinitely fails at both goals anyway. annotation end  Situated software is a way of saying "Most software gets only a few users for a short period; why not take advantage of designing with that in mind?"
 This, strangely, is a kind of progress, not because situated
software will replace other kinds of applications, but because it
mostly won't. For all the value we get out of the current software
ecosystem, it doesn't include getting an application built for
a handful of users to use for a few months. Now, though, I think we're
starting to see a new software niche, where communities get form-fit
tools for very particular needs, tools that fail most previous test of
design quality or success, but which nevertheless function well,
because they are so well situated in the community that uses them.

                  Book notes: Against the Grain, by James C. Scott
                  

January 1st, 2020
Here are some notes and quotes that particularly stood out to me from each chapter of Against the Grain. This isn't a summary of the book. It's mostly for my future self to refer back to (and thus probably missing a lot for someone who hasn't read it), but the tidbits are so interesting that I figured I'd share it nonetheless in case it's remotely helpful to someone else.
You can read my more coherent review of the book here.
Introduction The narrative of the agrarian ecological complex "has typically been told as one of progress, of civilization and public" ... "ascent of man story"fire was the first great hominid tool for niche construction States appear 4 millennia after the first crop domestications and sedentismStates dominate the archaeological and cultural recordInstitutional biasSelf-portraitureNomadic life was generally biodegradable... the state has dominated only the last 0.2% of our species' political life"Strapped to the metronome of a major cereal grain" (ch 1, p. 20)"History records no cassava states, no sago, yam, taro, plantain, bread fruit, or sweet potato states...only grains are best suited to concentrated production, tax assessment, appropriation, cadastral surveys, storage, and rationing.""Stateness" is an institutional continuum (p. 23)Bondage appears to have been a condition of the ancient state's survival "I want to question the use of the term 'collapse' to describe many of these events... 'Collapse' denote the civilizational tragedy of a great early kingdom being brought low, along with its cultural achievements." (31)Barbarians are a political category, not a cultural one. In China, when they began to enter from the frontier and begin to enter the spectrum of Chinese rule, "they were said to 'have entered the map'"Ch 1 – The Domestication of Fire, Plants, Animals... and UsNiche construction: "Unlike optimal foraging theory that takes the disposition of the natural world as a given..., what we have here is a deliberate disturbance ecology in which hominids create a mosaic of biodiversity and a distribution of desirable resources more to their liking." (40)Fire externalizes the digestive processS. Mesopotamia was not at all arid"The very breadth of a subsistence web ... poses insurmountable obstacles to the imposition of a single political authority" (49)"The first fixed villages were at the seam of several different ecological zones ... to buffer themselves from the risk of exclusive dependence on any one." (52)"Wetland societies were environmentally resistant to centralization and control from above. There was no single dominant resource that could be monopolized or controlled from the center, let alone easily taxed." (57)"The populations avoiding full reliance on fixed-field crops for the bulk of their caloric needs might actually have known what they were doing." (58)"Large portfolio of subsistence options" 59"Most discussion of plant domestication and settlement assume that early peoples could not wait to settle down in one spot." 62Subsistence insurance policy. 63Ch 2 – Landscaping the World: The Domus ComplexHomo sapiens have been domesticating whole environments, not just species. 70Full cultivation was taken up not as an opportunity but as a last resort when no other alternative was possible. 71 Demographic transition to drudgery "Domus" = householdLess diversity in more predictable environments "Fully domesticated" = in effect, our creation; it can no longer thrive without our attentions. Like a housewife. Why it's fragile to be a 50s housewife. 75"Superspecialized floraba 'basket case', and its future is entirely dependent on our own. If it ceases to please us, it will be banished.""Emotional dampening as a condition for life in the crowded Domus, where instant reaction to predator and prey are no longer powerful pressures of natural selection. With physical protection and nutrition more secure, the domesticated animal can be less intently alert." 81Rates of fertility increase so dramatically as to offset the losses through mortality. 82The spread of sedentism transformed Homo sapiens into far more of a herd animal.Only 240 human generations have elapsed since the first adoption of agriculture.Hunting and foraging are, in terms of complexity, as different from cereal-grain farming as cereal-grain farming is to repetitive work on a modern assembly line. Each step represents a substantial narrowing of focus and simplification of tasks. 90Our species was already disciplined and subordinated to the metronome of our own crops. 91Deskilling. 92Ch 3 – Zoonoses: A Perfect Epidemiological Storm Pressing on the carrying capacity of their environment's resources, they were obliged to work harder for their subsistence. 95Planting and livestock rearing as dominant subsistence practices were avoided as long as posible because of the work they required. 96Fragile and vulnerable Ag revolution -> increase diseaseSudden and otherwise unexplained abandonment of previously well-populated sites... made posible by the crowding enabled by the Neolithic They understood that long-distance travelers, traders, and soldiers were likely carriers of disease Virtually all the infectious diseases due to microorganisms specifically adapted to Homo sapiens came into existence only in the past 10k years... arose as a result of the beginnings of urbanism and agriculture Before extensive human travel, migratory birds that nested together combined long-distance travel with crowding to constitute, perhaps, the main vector for the spread of disease over distance. 101Sedentary agriculturists had unprecedented high rates of reproduction—enough to more than compensate for the also unprecedentedly high rates of mortality. 113Larger spacing of children for hunter-gatherers due to logistics of moving camp Earlier puberty, more regular ovulation, later menopause Greater value of the children as a labor force Infants can be weaned earlier on soft foodsMiracle of compound interest!Ch 4 — Agro-ecology of the Early Statestate arose by harnessing the grain and manpower module as a basis of control and appropriation. Grain easier to control than a diverse economy.Elite niche construction Fattening and protecting the goose that lays the golden eggs None of the early state centers in Mesopotamia was even remotely self-sufficient "Non-state spaces" generally had "friction"—arid deserts, mountainous zones virtually require dispersed subsistence strategies Only the cereal grains can serve as a basis for taxation: visible, divisible, assessable, storable, transportable, and rationable One reason for the official distrust and stigmatization of the merchant class in china was the simple fact that its wealth, unlike the rice planter, was illegible, concealable, and fugitive Simultaneous ripening of cereal grains is important to a tax collector. One stop-shopping works best, least amount of work. 133The Great Wall of China was built as much to keep Chinese taxpaying cultivators inside as to keep the barbarians (nomads) outside. 138The first act of many peasant rebellions has been to burn down the local records office. They understand implicitly that behind the coercive machinery lies piles of paperwork. 139The entire exercise in early state formation is one of standardization and abstraction. 144Land, happily for the tax collector, does not moveBreeding a tax base and troopsWriting was resisted because of its association with the state and taxes, just as ploughing was long resisted because of its association with drudgery. 148Ch 5 — Population Control: Bondage and Warthe state remained as focused on the number and productivity of its "domesticated" subjects as a shepherd might husband his flock or a farmer tend his crops. 151The scribal summaries of laboring groups employ the identical age and sex categories as those used to describe "herds of domestic animals". 160Relocate them frequently to minimize the danger of revolt or escape. Socially demobilized and atomized = easier to control and absorb. Few local social ties => unable to muster collective opposition. "The principle of socially detached servants"Captives of a working age, raised at the expense of another society, and get to exploit their most productive years. 167Common to find pervasive slavery alongside rapid cultural assimilation and social mobility War was seen as a route to wealth and comfort. 172If such states had to extract such labor (as slavery) exclusively from their own core subjects, they would have run a high risk of provoking flight or rebellion Domesticating women's prosecuting in general. 181Ch 6 — Fragility of the Early State: Collapse as Disassembly The term "civilizational collapse" doesn't necessarily mean a decline in regional population, health, well-being, or nutrition, and sometimes it represented an improvement. "Heroic period of archaelogy" 186Much that passé as collapse is, rather, a disassembly of larger but more fragile political units into smaller, more stable components  Enlargement of the commercial sphere also enlarged the sphere of transmitted diseases "Trade, responsible for the monumental splendor of alluvium statelets, may ironically have played a large role in their disappearance"Unique and unsuitable demands on the surrounding environment => gradual economic suffocationDeforestation => flooding/erosion/siltation, which over time would destroy the civilization doing the deforesting Malaria is a "disease of civilization" in the sense that it arose with land clearance for agriculture Agriculture => Salinization, soil exhaustion Lacked the fine-grained knowledge that would have made it easier to modify their appropriation in line with the capacity of their subjects to pay Unlikely that the central authority will cut costs in proportion to the reduction of revenueThe fact that the Nile was hemmed in by deserts made it possible to press the population harder than if the peasantry had more running room. 208Why deplore "collapse" when the situation it depicts is often the disaggregation of a complex, fragile, and oppressive state? We should aim to normalize collapse The well-being of a population mustn't be confounded with the power of a state center "Dark" (as in Dark Age) should refer more to our knowledge than to a characteristic of the period itself "The self-documenting court center that offered a convenient one-stop shop for historians" Ch 7 – The Golden Age of the BarbariansStates were ecologically confined to the well-watered, rich soils that could support a concentration of labor/grainMany terms were invented in state centers to describe and stigmatize those who had not yet become state subjects In the Ming Dynasty, the term "cooked" referred to assimilating barbarians. They were said to have "entered the map"Threat posted by barbarians was the single most important factor limiting the growth of the states It was better to be a barbarian once there were states, so long as those states weren't too strong; pillaging was a lucrative form of hunting and foraging. "The carrying capacity of barbarian ecology is enhanced by the existence of petty states."States served as trading posts. Because states represented such narrow agro-ecologies, they relied on products from outside, and the barbarians grew rich providing those products.Plunder of and trade with the state made economic life on the state's margins more viable and lucrative."'Barbarians' are not a 'stage' of historical/evolutionary progress in which the highest stage of life is the state as taxpayer.""Barbarian" is best understood as a position vis-a-vis a state.Barbarian geography is all those geographies that are unsuitable for state making (mountains, steps, forest, swamps, deserts, moors, the sea). They are best defined as the negative space around state making zones.Among the Romans, the contrast between their diet of grain compared to the Gallic diet of meat/dairy was a key marker of their claim to civilized status. Barbarian societies can be quite hierarchical, but generally not based on inherited property.The barbarian story is deeply subversive States preceded tribes and, in fact, largely invented them as an instrument of ruleContemporary piracy suggests that even today, speed, mobility, and surprise can tactically prevail over quasi-sedentary container shipsRaiding is self-liquidating. Raiders are most likely to adjust their strategy to a "protection racket". In extracting a sustainable surplus from sedentary community i es and fending off external attacks to protect its base, a stable protection racket is hard to distinguish from the archaic state itself.Barbarian-state relations can be seen as a contest for the right to appropriate the surplus from the sedentary grain-and-manpower module.The larger and more navigable the river, the larger the potential polity, because these communities were dependent on trade and exchange with other ecological zones.As technology improved and population increased, trade became more valuable. Metcalfe's law.The peripheries of the agrarian states became valuable commercial landscapes, as sites of valuable commodities. "You can conquer a kingdom on horseback, but to rule it you have to dismount."Nomads require sedentary communities as depots of manpower, revenue, and trading outlets; they tend to disappear when their host collapses."Political enclosure movement""Fiscally invisible"There would've been periods when leaving behind the plough of a state subject to take up foraging, pastoralism, and marine collecting would've represented both a rational economic calculation as we as a bolt for freedom #history

                  Continuous urbanization in Japan
                  

May 21st, 2018
I originally published this in May of last year in Idea Collector, one of my old blogs.
Epistemic status: This is a quick write up of my personal experience wandering Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo last May. I'd be curious to learn how it compares to objective measures, models, others' experience, and so on!
Epistemic effort: I noted my impressions in bullet-point form while wandering around the cities, then when I returned from the trip I spent ~1h turning those messy notes into a form that might actually make sense to a non-Devon.

The continuity of urbanism along the 500km shinkansen bullet train track between Osaka and Tokyo was astonishing. Throughout the journey, the buildings almost never thinned out, and at no point did I feel like we were in suburbia, let alone true countryside. The route went through Kyoto and Nagoya, both major cities in their own right, and there was a continuous metropolitan zone along the entire shinkansen line.

At the same time, I was surprised by Japan’s lack of density, especially in Tokyo. I didn’t find any one area that felt especially built up. The entire metropolitan area is highly populated, and the median building height is greater than most American cities, but there was no central urban core with significantly higher density than the surrounding areas. Instead, the height level of buildings was mostly continous across all neighborhoods. By contrast, major American cities tend to have an extremely dense, bustling center with steadily decreasing density in neighborhoods radiating out from that core. This is usually a business and shopping district with high rise apartments. Many people live in that center, but even more commute in and out each day for work.

Japanese cities’ lack of centers with extreme density surprised me. My intution about how cities formed was a life-scale Hotelling Game, in which the optimal location for a new enterprise is in the middle of where everything else is. This minimizes the distance to the greatest number of amentities, shops, people, and so on, and so it is the highest value land. Businesses want to be where people are, and people want to live close to their schools and work. This creates a cycle in which city centers are valuable, incentivizing developers to build denser, taller buildings. As more people move in, the land in those centers because even more valuable, which incentivizes more building. With all these uses vying for the same space, the only alternative to build up, and you get urban cores with a far greater average building height than the surrounding areas.


.
The above diagram is from Alain Bertaud's paper The spatial organization of cities. My simplistic mental model of cities as a Hotelling Game matches "A. The classic mono centric model", but Tokyo feels closer to C. or D.Of course this is a simplification—zoning rules, geography, weather, and more affect land values, too. But the Hotelling dynamic plays a role in shaping the density and land values of cites. You can see the effect in the Google Earth images of New York and San Francisco below.But Tokyo doesn't follow this model. The entire metro region is one of the most populous in the world, but it's not actually that tall. There are lots of "centers" of the city, each of which have tall buildings, but almost none are extraordinarily tall. This is directly contrary to the impression I'd had before visiting the city. I feel like most imagery of Tokyo is dense, bustling, neon-lit streets, but it was much more human-scale and personable than that. Moreso than the much less dense San Francisco, in my opinion.


Google Earth view of Manhattan

The Financial District on the south end of the island and Midtown just below Central Park are extremely dense. Concentration of people draws in businesses and shops, which in turn makes it a more attractive place to build housing, transit, and amenities. Meanwhile, building height drops off quickly outside of these centers. The median number of floors in Greenwich Village (around Washington Square Park) is less than four!


Google Earth view of San Francisco

San Francisco is a striking illustration of this phenomenon. It’s is a bit unfair, because most in neighborhoods outside of the Financial District and (as of 2015) Mission Bay, buildings are limited to 4-6 stories. However, the SF’s neighborhoods for the most part took on their current form before building codes cemented it, so Hotelling still provides a useful model.

Japanese cities don’t appear to follow this logic. Tokyo’s tall buildings are fairly even distributed throughout the city. There is variation of course, and neighborhoods like Ueno are more spread out than others, but there is no single area that is far taller than the rest. The closest thing to "downtown" was the area around Tokyo Station, but that was more a function of its role as an intercity transit hub connecting the shinkansen lines than of being the central business district.


Google Earth view of central Tokyo

I’m still at a loss as to what caused this dynamic. My best guess is that the city developed alongside a mature, well-supported rail system that could whisk people from one part of the city to another, so the advantage of being in the middle of it all was lower. Manhattan’s subway system could be described in much the same way though, so this answer is not satisfying.

Japanese land use regulations are also very different from their counterparts in the US , so that certainly played a part too. It’s possible that this accounts for most of the difference. In the San Francisco most neighborhoods limit buildings to 4-6 stories, which artificially enforces the funnel shape, where the old parts of the city that were dense before regulations took hold are the only place where tall buildings are allowed in the first place. Other US cities follow a similar regulatory pattern. This raises an interesting question — if SF lifted all density limits, where would we see growth? Would the financial district grow even taller, or would the surrounding neighborhoods build out to match its height? My guess is it would be a mixture of the two, with further densification of the core as well as development of the surrounding areas, with lessening growth as you went outward. Overall though, the effect would likely be an evening of heights across the city. I’d guess that the variance in median heights between neighborhoods would decrease, and we’d have a situation closer to that of Tokyo.

I’m not well-versed in the history of Japanese land use. So if you have any other ideas about why their building height variance is low, please let me know!

                  Traveling neighborhoods: a different kind of group trip
                  

March 29th, 2024
I've discovered a group trip format that I really love, and I wanted to share it with others because (a) you might find it fun to host or join something like this in the future and (b) selfishly, I would like more people to organize trips like this so that I can join them!

The basic idea simple: live in an interesting new place for a few days or weeks with friends in walking distance, as if we were neighbors. I pick a walkable neighborhood in a city, tell friends what dates I will be there, and then draw a circle of a 5-minute walk from my AirBNB and  recommend to friends that they book within it. I've now organized half a dozen of these trips to places like Chautauqua, Buenos Aires, Las Catalinas, and beyond with groups of 8-40 people each time. It's a blast and I can't wait to do more.

I love these trips because they are a way to explore the world while staying connected to friends. In some ways it's even better than living in the same city as a friend, because the intensive nature of an extended trip with a small group gives you focused time to see the same people every day or at least multiple times a week. This builds friendships quickly, compared to the typical rhythm that happens when you live in the same city as a friend, where you might see each other for dinner once a month but never really build up that velocity of the friendship.

An important aspect of this format is that it is very much "choose-your-own-adventure". Here is the basic recipe:Throughout the year, I tell friends that I'll be in X city (e.g. Buenos Aires) for a particular timeframe (e.g. the last three weeks of November) and that if they happen to be free, I'd love to see them there. If they seem interested, I send them an email with some basic details about the trip and a spreadsheet for them to sign up if they're interested.It's very low-key. Basically I just put a pin on a map saying, "Here's where I'll be staying. You should book an AirBNB within a 5 min walk".I create a simple spreadsheet where everyone puts the dates they plan to be in Buenos Aires, so they can coordinate with each other. Some folks choose to book together in group houses, some do not.Everyone comes for different lengths of time – some for the whole month, some for less then a week, and everything in between.Most people work remotely from Buenos Aires over the course of the month, though some folks take the time off to explore the city. It's very much choose-your-own adventure.We join up for meals most nights, and everyone is welcome to coordinate their own activities together throughout the days, but there's no expectation that everyone hangs out all the time.It's very low-commitment. Lots of people show up last-minute, and other people drop out last-minute. Think of it more as a transient neighborhood rather than a big group tour.
TacticsI've now hosted a bunch of these and have learned a lot about how to make them fun. Here are some of the tactics I've learned over the years:Chat group as the primary coordinating mechanism: Telegram with channels + viewable historyViewable history is important because people join at different times, and they often have questions that have already been asked. Unfortunately Telegram is the only chat app I've found that has this feature.Once you get past ~10 people, channels are important because they reduce the amount of noise people have to deal with from irrelevant messages.Share the list of people who are coming ahead of time: When inviting someone, it's helpful to give them a curated list of others who will be coming so that they get excited to see them. This becomes less important for folks who've joined on one of these trips in the past, but for folks who don't really understand the format yet, it's especially helpful.Curation is key: At this size (10-20 people at any given time in the city), it's really important to curate the group. People often ask me if they can bring people they don't know, and I've found that it can really bring down the vibe, because it's hard for me to tell if they will jive. It's a bit uncomfortable to say no to your friend asking if they can bring someone you haven't met, but I can assure you it's much more uncomfortable to spend days/weeks with someone you haven't met who turns out to be difficult or unpleasant. (I have learned this lesson the hard way.)Group size: I'm considering doing a larger size so that it would actually feel more like a neighborhood. The 10-15 in the neighborhood at a time is a bit of an odd number because it's too large for 1 dinner table but too small to feel like everyone can genuinely break off and not get to know everyone on the trip.Decoupled bookings: It's important that everyone books on their own rather than you booking accommodation for everyone, because otherwise you (a) bear a lot of risk and (b) are stuck in the middle of people's preferences, which is a surprisingly unpleasant place to be. (The alternative to this is to be extremely hardline about what dates everyone needs to be there, more like a wedding, and try to do something like book a hotel block. But that still creates a lot of work for you and not necessarily much benefit.) If people want to share AirBNBs or something like that, you can still put them in touch with each other, but I don't recommend getting in the middle of the transaction because it likely won't contribute much and it'll get messy quickly. (Again, a lesson I've learned the hard way. If things go well, people don't really notice all the work you put in; if they go poorly, they get angry at you.)Light structure: I've found the trips are even more fun and special if you add some optional structure around them to nudge people to share what they are working on or thinking about. My friends tend to be people who care deeply about their work, and I love learning from their expertise. Here are a few things I've tried, and I plan to experiment with other ideas too in future trips:Dinner leads: One of my goals for this trip is for its organization to be fairly decentralized. There are two reasons for this: (1) it makes it more interesting if different people provide their ideas and energy to plan how we spend our time, rather than me doing all the central planning, and (2) it takes some of the coordination load off my shoulders, which allows me to not spend 100% of my energy planning and allows me to have more fun. One way I achieve this is by asking people to volunteer to organize at least one of the nightly dinners during the trip. They are responsible for picking the restaurant and getting a reservation, which means we end up going to a broader diversity of restaurants than if I were to pick all of them. The organizer also has the opportunity to bring something extra to the dinner, e.g. start the meal with a prompt for everyone to discuss to make the conversation go a little deeper than it otherwise would. The organizer is encouraged to get creative to make it interesting for everyone!Lightning talks: Fun opportunity for everybody to show off their expertise in a particular area, and I ended up learning interesting things about everybody. One thing I've experimented with is having an evening where everyone gives a lightning talk, but after a few of them it gets a little boring to sit still like that, so in the future I'm going to experiment with doing 1 lightning talk over dessert each night instead.Group workouts & sports: On one of the recent trips, a friend suggested that we all go play Padel, which was something I never would've thought to suggest to the group. It was the highlight of the trip for me! I'm so glad he recommended it, and it was a great instance of how having the schedule emerge rather than being planned centrally by me makes the trip way more fun.
ChallengesGroup dinner size: Group dinners are a bit unwieldy. Natural instinct is for everyone to gather together each night, but dinners of >6 people are not so fun in my experience. Ideally we'd find a natural way for people to break off in groups more often. This is one downside to me being the primary hub of the group rather than everyone individually having relationships ahead of time, although many of these people do know each other from other contexts too. Effectively signaling that the invite is very low-key: Most people have never participated in trips with this format before, so when I invite them, it's hard to credibly signal that it's totally fine if they don't come. This has gotten easier though as these trips are getting better known in my social circle, since they have more context for it.Remember you're not a tour guide company: It's sometimes hard for me not to feel really responsible for everyone's experience, which is a bit stressful especially as the group gets large and the problems people bump into grows with the number of people, but it's critical for me to make it as decoupled as possible and not play "tour guide", because otherwise I will not have fun. Plus a big part of the purpose of these trips is to experience what it's like to live together in a place, and they're grown adults who can take care of themselves. I'm not getting paid, so if I let myself get sucked into playing tour guide, it can really ruin it for me
If you're interested in organizing a trip like this, I'm happy to share the materials I've created over time as a starting point for how to explain and coordinate a trip of this sort!

As my friends are more and more scattered across the globe in different cities, finding ways to be together has become more important for cultivating those friendships. These "traveling neighborhoods" have been an incredible way to not only stay in touch with people I care about but also get to know them much more deeply than before, and I hope to see more people organizing trips like this that I can join too!One of our upcoming trips is to Seabrook, WashingtonThe most recent traveling neighborhood I organized was to Las Catalinas, Costa Rica

                  The unconference toolbox
                  

July 4th, 2023

So, you’ve been invited to an unconference! Maybe you’re not entirely sure what that means (did the organizers misspell "conference"?), or maybe you’ve been to dozens of these before and you’re looking for some ideas for how to run an awesome session.
This blog post will be a quick primer on what an unconference is, and then we’ll share some tips on how to make a session excellent, both as the host and as a participant.
TABLE OF CONTENTS:What is an unconference?Selecting a session themeIdeas for session formatsTactics for running a great sessionCommon failure modesHow to be a great session attendeeHelp us make this doc better!What is an unconference?Unconferences are participant-driven. The agenda is created by the attendees when they arrive at the event, and anyone can propose and host a session on a topic they want to discuss. This is in contrast to a typical conference, where the organizers design a schedule of talks and events in advance.
An unconference is a shared project. The unconference format is designed to break down the distinction between session hosts and participants. While a conventional conference treats attendees like a passive audience to be entertained by the organizers, the unconference format gives everyone who attends an opportunity to make the event awesome. By giving each guest ownership over how the time is spent, it turns the event into a shared project. Building things together builds strong relationships, and it can blossom into longer-running collaborations after the event.
Unconferences are choose-your-own-adventure. At any moment there will be multiple talks happening in parallel, and you can attend whichever one piques your interest. At a typical unconference, a majority of participants will facilitate at least one session.
The unconference board is the center of the event. The board is a large grid representing the schedule. The time slots start out blank, and over the course of the unconference, attendees fill them out by proposing sessions. These can change throughout the event as people get to know each other. For example, if you meet someone with complementary expertise, you might consider inviting them to co-host it with you.
An example of an unconference board after it has been filled out by the attendees.Selecting a session themeAll topics are fair game at unconferences (unless the organizers specifically state a more narrow theme, of course). Here are a few categories of themes to get your juices flowing:Your professional expertise (e.g. mining black holes, how to create real estate pro forma, environmental review regulatory reform)Something you’re passionate about (e.g. pottery, quantified self, your experience going through IVF, a standup comedy set)A group experience (e.g. improv, acrylic pouring, cooking class, giant jigsaw puzzle, blind "dining in the dark" dinner, board games, photography workshop)A physical activity (e.g. stretching, group hike, hunting for four leaf clovers, breathing exercises, square dancing.Ideas for session formatsAn unconference is an opportunity to mix it up when it comes to format. While conference-style talks can be awesome additions to unconferences too, sessions that take a more interactive or creative approach are where unconferences shine. Here are some ideas for formats that you might consider for your session:Fireside chat. An informal conversation between an interviewer and a guest speaker, usually in a cozy setting.Facilitated group discussion about an important question.Pre-prepared talk + Q&A. This one is the most similar to what you’ve seen at conferences. To take advantage of an unconference's informality, we encourage you to pause more often for audience reactions or questions.Lightning talks. You can organize a mini series of short, 5-10 minute presentations on a topic. The series could have a specific theme, or not.Impromptu panel. After a round of intros, you pick 2-5 experts and form a panel. You can be moderator, or you can ask one of the experts to ask good questions.Demo of a new technology. Brownie points if it's a live demo! But make sure you're prepared so that there aren't lots of awkward gaps.Live podcast. Ask another attendee if you can interview them.Science experiment. Design an experiment that the group can test together during the session. It doesn’t necessarily have to fit in the 1 hour session; the experiment could run throughout the event and bear results at the end, or possibly even after the unconference is over.Group brainstorm in a Google Doc. This is a much higher bandwidth brainstorm format than a single-threaded group conversation. Pose some good questions, ask everyone to type their responses underneath each question, and allow people to comment afterwards. Tip: start by spending 3 minutes "brainstorming ways to brainstorm", then pick your favorite 2-3 ideas and spend the session on those.Hot seat. Break into small groups of 3-5 (zoom or IRL), then pick someone to be on the hot seat first. That person chooses a "spicy-ness" level of questions they're comfortable asking. Spicer meaning more vulnerable/personal. For 5 minutes, anyone can jump in and ask questions, one at a time. Switch after 5 minutes. (Thanks to Bhaumik Patel for emailing us this suggestion!) Tips:Break the ice by going first in front of whole group. Choose the highest spicy level.Have sample questions people can ask.If someone is shy, let them know they can skip any questionSuggest no more than 1 minute per answer to keep pace going.Tactics for running a great sessionHere are some creative facilitation moves that might improve the flow of your session. You don’t need to do all or even any of these. They’re just here to give get your juices flowing as you plan.Ask everyone why they're interested. "Let's go around and say a sentence or two about any specific questions you'd like me to address." Good for making a Q&A more targeted to people's curiosities.Intros. "Let's go around and say a sentence or two about why you're here and your familiarity with this topic."Play with the length of time. Unconference boards are typically broken down into 1-hour blocks, but that doesn’t mean your session has to be 1 hour! You could take over 2 contiguous time blocks to make a mega 2-hour session, or you could use just 30 minutes if you don’t need the full hour.Invite specific people to attend your session. Think about who at the event will have interesting things to add to the discussion and ask them if they’d like to attend your session.Promote your session in the group chat. Many unconference organizers will create a group chat for everyone to get announcements throughout the event. 10 minutes before your session starts, you can message the group chat to tell them about your session and who you think would find it interesting.Invite everyone to sit on the floor. This can make the session feel more playful and casual. (You can also just remove all of the chairs from the room beforehand, then they will have to sit on the floor!)Choose an appropriate seating layout. If you want to encourage interactivity, choose a space where chairs are arranged in a circle. If you want to draw everyone's attention to a speaker or a panel, choose a space where chairs are oriented towards a stage.Bring a physical artifact. Having a physical object related to what you’re working on can make what you’re talking about more real. You can think of it as grownup show and tell!Find a cohost. Think about who might have overlapping/complementary expertise and invite them to run the session with you.Discuss a topic you’ve written about in depth before. Some of the best sessions we’ve seen have been writers sharing a quick overview of an essay or book they’ve written, and then giving audience members time for Q&A so the discussion can go beyond what they’ve published publicly. Another variant of this is that you could print out copies of the essay and ask people to read it in silence for the first 5-10 minutes of your session.Oblique strategies. This set of cards with cryptic prompts is helpful for breaking creative blocks. Draw a card at random and it might help stimulate new ideas and ways to approach your work.Create a way for people to keep up the discussion after. Start a group chat, promote a mailing list, or plan a dinner after the event.Limit the number of people in your session. If you want to have a small group discussion, for example, you can tell people "The first 8 people who show up will get to be part of the discussion. If you come after that, you can sit quietly as an audience member" or some variation.Ask someone to be the notetaker. Have them share their notes afterwards with the group or with the rest of the unconference.Common failure modesThe host is under-prepared. This is the most common failure mode. Although unconferences are designed to be casual, you should still take the role of hosting a session seriously. We've seen amazing sessions that required zero prep, but it's a high variance strategy. A host should at least be able to ask the right questions if a conversation falters.The session feels scripted. Long, non-interactive presentations miss what makes unconferences special. The fix is to encourage group participation.Intros take up the whole session. Beware the Law of Intro Inflation: that each intro tends to take slightly longer than the previous one. For a group of less than 10 people, intros usually take about 10 minutes. For 10-20 people, you'll need to ask people to keep it to 2 sentences or less. For a large group of 20 or more people, beware, and don’t hesitate to be the Bad Cop!A few loud voices dominate the conversation. A great facilitator is a great host, which means encouraging quiet participants to contribute and being willing to gently interrupt the long-winded.The topic goes off the rails. If your topic degenerates into a debate about capitalism, a great host will find a way to get it back on track.The format is over-structured. We've seen 45 minute sessions with 15 steps (e.g. 1 minute of silent brainstorming, followed by 3 minutes of talking to your neighbors, repeated 4 times, etc). Sometimes this works, but what usually happens is that participants feel like their conversations are repeatedly cut short.Only a few people show up. This can often be a feature and not a bug, and pivot to a more intimate, tailored conversation. Sometimes these end up being the best sessions, because they give the small group a chance to go deeper. You can also always cancel the session.Too many people show up for your format. The fix depends on the format, but it could involve trying it anyway, pivoting to select an expert panel, dividing the crowd into small groups, etc.First-timers don't participate. Unconferences are wonderfully informal, and you don't need experience to host. If you're shy, try cohosting with another attendee! Alternatively, you can prepare a session and decide after day 1 whether or not to put your session up on the calendar. It can also be encouraging to ask others for their feedback on your topic.How to be a great session attendeeEveryone is responsible for making an unconference great, not just the session host! Here are some ways you can support the host in making each session great: Don’t be afraid to ask questions and add comments, as long as the host seems they would appreciate it. Unconferences are designed to be more interactive than traditional conferences, and it should be more of a back-and-forth between hosts and participants rather than a performer-audience relationship.Help the host keep time. It’s easy to lose track of time, especially when you’re facilitating a great discussion!Share your own experiences, though also make sure you’re respecting the host’s intention for the session and not dominating the conversation.Don’t look at your phone! This one should be obvious, yet somehow it seems not to be…Help us make this post better!Do you have ideas for how to create a great unconference experience?

 Inside Argentina's currency exchange black markets


                  Inside Argentina's currency exchange black markets
                  

September 10th, 2022
In Argentina, your money is worth double if you skip the airport currency exchange and instead go to one of the many black market exchanges hidden throughout Buenos Aires.
These illegal exchanges are called "cuevas" (the word for "cave" in Spanish), and they are a crucial part of Argentina's financial infrastructure. Argentinians are constantly exchanging their pesos (ARS) for other currencies, usually US dollars (USD), and back again because they simply cannot rely on their country's fiat currency. The value of ARS is infamously unstable. The country's money supply has persistently high inflation, punctuated by bouts of hyperinflation. Argentina has seen an average of 100% annual inflation for the last century. In 1989, inflation reached 3,000%!The government has also imposed strict capital controls that make moving money in and out of the country challenging. It is impossible to take USD out of Argentinian ATMs, even as an American with a US bank account.Argentinians who vacation in Costa Rica or pay their child's college tuition in Miami have to pay exorbitant taxes to move money out of the country, or sometimes cannot move the money at all. As a result, these sorts of transactions require an illegal workaround.ARS has a pegged exchange rate, meaning its value is not set by market demand like USD but rather is set by government mandate — and the pegged exchange rate almost always overstates the value of the peso. As a result, there is a thriving black market that sets a floating, informal exchange rate called Dólar Blue. These two rates are often dramatically different: as of early 2022, the official ARS to USD exchange rate is 110 to 1, while the informal is 215 to 1. If you bring $1 USD to a legal exchange, you get just 110 ARS pesos, whereas you’ll get 215 ARS pesos in return for that same dollar at a cueva.As a result of these challenges, there is a lot of demand to move money around without the government’s visibility. Illegal money movement is so common that it's discussed as openly and casually as people in the US might discuss what bank they use.
This backdrop makes Argentina a poster child for cryptocurrencies. The argument from crypto proponents is that Argentinians have personally experienced the problems of centralized fiat currency for generations, so they're especially receptive to the case for decentralized currencies that their government cannot meddle with.
Crypto enthusiasts are correct in many ways. I know an Argentinian grandma who barely uses a computer, yet as soon as she heard about Bitcoin from her grandson in 2016, she instantly said "Money the government can't touch? Help me buy it right now," and she's been holding it ever since. (An understandable reaction when you've seen your country go through 5 different currencies in your lifetime.) 
I've also seen firsthand how crypto has transformed the way the black market operates in Argentina. When I first started visiting the country on a yearly basis in 2018, cuevas generally only advertised exchange rates between ARS and other fiat currencies, such as USD and the euro (EUR). Now, they've added the exchange rates between BTC, ETH, TRON, and other cryptocurrencies to the menu because more and more of their customers are demanding it.
However, the specific ways crypto is used in Argentina are quite different from how many people who are building out the crypto ecosystem originally imagined it. 
For example, crypto enthusiasts often imagine a world where individuals control their own wallets directly — storing the cryptographic code on their local computers or phones, not using a third party, like MetaMask.
But the reality on the ground is quite different: Argentinian crypto users use intermediaries and centralized apps to access crypto. This is especially striking given the reasons Argentinians use crypto in the first place, which you’d expect to make them especially receptive to the value proposition of decentralization. 
The peso lost almost all its value in a generationIf you'd saved $100,000 USD worth of pesos in 1995, they would be worth about $310 USD today. In the mid 1990s, 1 ARS = $1 USD; as of July 2022, the value is 322 ARS = $1 USD. Anyone who held onto pesos in that time would have had their life savings obliterated. 
Argentinians have learned that it's much better to save in other countries' currencies, and the favorite for decades has been USD, particularly in the form of $100 bills. In 1995, a paper from the Federal Reserve estimated that "Argentina has received as much as $40 billion in net shipments of U.S. currency, or well over $1,000 per capita," and the number has likely only increased since then.Argentinians have also learned to not trust banks, even with accounts denominated in other currencies. In 2001-2002, the government enacted something called "el corralito", shutting Argentinians' access to their bank accounts for almost a year. When they could finally extract money again, they found that (a) their USD deposits had to be exchanged for pesos and (b) pesos had lost 2/3 of their value. The lesson the Argentines learned was that they couldn't trust banks or any other government-regulated financial services, because at any moment the government could just stop them from accessing their money.
I've seen more $100 dollar bills in Argentina than I've seen in my entire lifetime in the US. $100 bills make up 80% of all US currency by value and 34% of all bills in circulation, according to economist Edgar Feige, and there are more "Benjamins" floating around than all of the $5 and $10 notes combined. This is unintuitive to most Americans – $100 bills are a rare sighting, at least for me. This is not unintuitive to Argentinians, whose family has probably saved stacks of $100 bills under mattresses for generations. 
Bricks — actual bricks, not stacks of cash — are another common savings mechanism, especially for working-class Argentinians. The value of bricks is fairly stable, and they're useful to a family building out their house. Argentina doesn't have a mortgage industry, and thus buying a pallet of bricks each time you get a paycheck is an effective way to pay for your home in installments. (Bricks aren't fully monetized, in that I don't think people buy bricks and then sell them later, so people only use this method of saving when they actually have something they want to use the bricks for.)
As you can imagine, there are challenges that come with saving in wads of $100 bills or stacks of bricks. For one thing, they take up a lot of space. Worse, your life savings are also at constant risk of theft, damage, and fire. If something does happen, the bills are not insured or protected by any institution; they’re just gone. 
As a result, Argentinians are interested in alternatives for storing their money, especially those that are both out of the clutches of their government and safer than storing piles of cash at home.
Crypto is starting to make it easier for Argentinians to saveIn the US, critics often make fun of crypto enthusiasts by pointing out that if you store your crypto on a hardware wallet and then lose the disk or the password, you're hosed. They scoff at crypto’s volatility and difficult user experience. They rightfully point out that most Americans won't make this tradeoff when institutions like banks can store the money for them securely, and without risk of losing the money. 
The tradeoffs are very different in Argentina: when your alternative is storing boxes of money in the attic or under your mattress, an unobtrusive hardware wallet sounds like a pretty good idea. Instead of carrying around suitcases of cash when you want to buy a house, you can just carry a USB stick with your private key to complete the transaction. When reflecting on crypto’s volatility, a common sentiment is "I would rather have a digital asset whose price goes up and down than a currency whose only real trend is down."
When most people think of crypto, they tend to think of bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). However, these are not ideal savings instruments because they are highly volatile and the transaction fees remain expensive. 
As a result, BTC and ETH are not so common for daily use in Argentina. Stablecoins such as USD-T, USD-C, and TRON are a more popular solution because they are pegged to a more stable currency (usually, USD).
Notably, the stablecoins popular for savings are also much more centralized. The Tether Foundation (which issues USD-T) has blocked transactions, and so has the Centre consortium (which issues USD-C). While TRON is technically not centralized, its cofounder has said that its architecture is not as decentralized as other blockchains’. 
They are attractive to Argentinians because they are not under the control of the government, not because they are decentralized and truly permissionless.Remote work is a way to decouple from the local economyAt the same time that crypto is changing how people use money, remote work is becoming increasingly common for Argentinians, because it allows them to earn in other currencies besides the peso. 
Remote workers sometimes set up bank accounts abroad so they don't have to bring them back into Argentina (and thus under the watchful eye of the government). They hold funds in places like Payoneer, PayPal, Mercury, or Estonian and US bank accounts, and withdraw just enough in Argentina to pay for the day-to-day expenses. Sometimes these are set up legally, and sometimes they are not.
USD and EUR have historically been the most popular currencies for remote work, in part because most of the remote jobs come from the US or Europe, and in part because those currencies are quite stable and accepted worldwide. 
However, overseas accounts remain out of reach for many people — setting up bank accounts abroad generally requires traveling there, which is expensive and time-consuming. 
Crypto is starting to help a small but growing number of remote workers in Argentina. Crypto allows them to move their money around from within Argentina, rather than having to use an intermediary in another country. This can save them trips to Estonia, the US, or wherever they would’ve had to open their bank accounts. 
If done covertly, it can also allow them to avoid Argentinian taxes (though this also requires coordination with their employer, which many employers are not willing to do, because it increases their liability). 
Argentinians who use crypto are increasingly untethered from the local Argentinian economy and increasingly plugged into the global cloud economy. Crypto is providing new solutions to problems that Argentina has faced for generations, and many Argentinians are excited about its potential to make it easier and safer to make, use, and store money.
Crypto is more practical than cash for many transactionsDistrust of the formal financial system is part of everyday life in Argentina. On every payday, the first stop many Argentinians make is to the cuevas (the illegal money exchanges), where they can swap their ARS for USD. 
This solves one problem — they’re no longer holding onto the hot potato that is the Argentine peso — but creates many other problems.
For one, stacks of bills are difficult to transport. This increases the energy cost necessary for any transaction. For example, an American friend of mine considered buying an apartment in Buenos Aires many years ago, but he balked when he realized he’d have to stuff a suitcase with $100 bills and fly them to Argentina in order to meet the seller’s expectations. He decided it was not worth the hassle.
It’s also dangerous to transport physical bills. Criminals know that people often carry cash, which makes muggings more attractive in Argentina compared to countries where most transactions are done on credit cards. 
The cuevas themselves have serious security problems, too — they have to transport sometimes millions of dollars in USD to and from their offices every day, so they end up having to move the location of their offices often so that other criminals don’t catch wind of where their couriers will be going in and out of their operation. 
Crypto is starting to help Argentinians deal with these problems. When making a big purchase, like a house, you can just carry a USB stick with your private key to complete the transaction, instead of having to transport suitcases full of cash. Like with cash, the government doesn't have to be the wiser that the crypto transaction occurred, enabling buyers and sellers to avoid capital controls and taxes. 
From talking to locals, it sounds like this is still rare, in part because both sides of the transaction have to agree to doing it in crypto. It also requires a high level of technical comfort, user experience is poor, and volatility is high. 
However, Argentinians have a lot of experience finding gaps in complex systems and then taking advantage of them fully, so I expect adoption to grow rapidly as word spreads that this is possible.
Another problem with cash is it may require a trusted third party that both the buyer and seller are comfortable with to hold the funds in escrow. Because many of these transactions are under the table, participants have little recourse if things go wrong, so it’s crucial that the third party is trustworthy. 
Smart contracts, programmed on the blockchain, have the potential to take out this third party and instead allow the buyer and seller to use a neutral contract that holds funds in escrow until both sides have agreed the transaction is complete. I’ve yet to hear of an Argentinian who’s done this, but it’s a big opportunity to solve a major problem in the ecosystem.
Crypto has also become central to the cuevas’ businessThe cuevas I spoke to said that crypto has made it much safer and cheaper to transfer large sums of money on the backend.
One key use case is to evade the government’s capital controls so that they can bring money in and out of Argentina. The government has made it impossible to extract USD from ATMs (yes, even if you're an American with an American bank account denominated in USD), so historically a major way that USD bills entered the country was through the crossing the physical border between Argentina and Uruguay. 
Uruguay is Argentina’s much more economically free neighbor, and it doesn't have restrictions on USD, so there has been a large flow of dollars across the river between the two countries. 
However, this was expensive and risky, since the cuevas had to smuggle large quantities of physical cash across the wide Rio de la Plata river. Crypto, especially USD-C and USD-T, has made it much easier to move that money around: now, the cuevas can move dollars in and out of the country from their highrise offices in Buenos Aires, rather than having to get onto a boat.
Another use is to pay someone in USD (usually in a stablecoin) in exchange for physical pesos. This is especially true for the "wholesalers" called "cuevas mayoristas," who are responsible for delivering large amounts of cash to smaller retail cuevas. 
Historically, these wholesalers have had motorcycle couriers who biked all around the city delivering stacks of pesos or dollars to smaller cuevas around town. These couriers wear custom-made vests tucked under their coats that are specially designed to carry the maximum number of bills without looking visibly bulky, to avoid the attention of law enforcement and criminals who might realize that a juicy payday is tucked into every nook and cranny around their chest and legs. 
Crypto has helped reduce this risk by giving the cuevas a way to move USD around without having to physically transport it on humans, who are prone to getting robbed. These couriers are still an important part of the business because Argentina is mostly a cash economy and thus people still need their physical pesos, but crypto has reduced the risk of loss dramatically by reducing the number of dollars they need to carry alongside the pesos.
Most Argentinians interact with crypto through intermediariesFrom talking to several cuevas and to my Argentinian friends, it sounds like it’s still uncommon for a typical person to use crypto to move money around directly. More likely, they go to a cueva and the cueva does the transaction for them, and the person doesn’t realize that the cueva was using crypto behind the scenes to do it.
I find this fascinating because one of the big assumptions of crypto proponents was that when crypto is adopted widely, everyone will control their own wallets and addresses. But in Argentina right now, it’s more common for consumers to interact with a centralized business that itself depends on the decentralization of crypto to exist, rather than for the consumers to interact with the blockchain directly. 
Another way to look at it is that the cuevas’ use of crypto on the backend enables people to more easily access dollars and other assets, even if they aren't interacting with crypto directly themselves.
In practice, this may end up having similar effects as the world where every person has their own hardware wallet because if the centralized cueva they depend on misbehaves or goes under, the decentralization of the blockchain that the cueva uses allows the end customer to just move over to another centralized service that is layered on top of the blockchain. 
But I could also see it working similarly to how we access the internet today. Technically, the internet is a decentralized service that you can connect to without going through an intermediary like Facebook or Google, but in practice almost everyone goes through those giants to access the web, and they layer lots of other centralized services on top that make it very difficult to eject from their ecosystem.
Even cuevas have picked convenience over decentralizationIt’s also fascinating to see the tools people and cuevas use to interact with crypto. Every cueva manager I met said that they and their customers prefer TRON over BTC or ETH or other more well-known cryptocurrencies, primarily because the transaction fees are so much lower. They said their customers don’t send them crypto that often, but when they do it’s usually TRON from a Binance wallet. They were surprised when my friend tried to send them ETH directly from his wallet.
The fact that they use TRON and Binance was notable, because both of these are centralized services without the best reputations. TRON’s design is technically decentralized, but its cofounder has described it as "centralized" because it depends on such a small number of super representatives, who are responsible for keeping track of the transaction history in the TRON ecosystem to validate transactions. 
Binance, a crypto exchange, is completely centralized, meaning that any balances that anyone has with Binance are stored on a central database that Binance controls, rather than on a permissionless blockchain. This means that Binance can freeze accounts if it chooses to, which sounds an awful lot like the situation the Argentine banking system was in during the 2001 "corralito," which left millions of Argentinians without access to their savings for nearly a year.
This ambivalence for decentralized cryptocurrencies isn’t limited to consumers. Of all the cuevas I spoke with, only one actually manages their own keys. Every other cueva I know uses Binance as their primary wallet for crypto, both for day-to-day transfers and for holding their reserves. Many of them are holding hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in these reserves, which could easily get shut down at any time since what they’re doing is explicitly illegal.
This is striking because it doesn't match up with the story that many crypto maximalists push about decentralization. Enthusiasts talk all about how important decentralization is, and given their unfortunate financial history, Argentinians more than most should appreciate those benefits. 
And yet, there they are, holding their reserves in a centralized app that could get shut down tomorrow, theoretically just as easily as the banks were during the 2001 corralito.
The way I explain this to myself, it seems that the key characteristic that draws Argentinians to these relatively centralized cryptocurrencies is that the government doesn't control them, rather than being completely decentralized in a way that no one controls them. 
To me, this is evidence that they are not bought into the philosophy behind crypto, but rather the utility of crypto. And insofar that the utility and philosophy are discordant, the more you'll find that the theories of crypto enthusiasts don't match reality. 
The revealed preference of these cuevas is that they care more about convenience than absolute decentralization. 
What makes this so odd is that a lower-risk alternative is fairly straightforward and only slightly more expensive — instead of using TRON through Binance, they could use TRON directly, which would only cost them $0.50 USD per transaction. This might not make sense for individuals moving small amounts of money around, but the cuevas are often storing hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in reserves in Binance, and so fifty cents on top of transactions of that scale is virtually nothing. It seems like a worthwhile insurance policy to avoid having your money in a centralized institution that is widely distrusted.
Unless I'm missing something, cuevas’ use of Binance seems very short-sighted, especially to store their reserves. My best guess of what’s going on is that they still haven’t learned all of the gotchas involved with crypto, simply because it’s so early. Additionally, the business owners often depend on younger employees to handle "the crypto stuff." An Argentinian friend of mine jokes that when you ask a cueva to do a crypto transaction, they call to the back of the office and bring out their "crypto guy," who’s usually like a 17-year-old kid with a smartphone who knows the basics of the Binance app. 
I'm curious to see what'll happen if Binance implodes—will the cuevas lose big, and if so, what will they learn? I could see it going one of two ways. On one hand, it might spook them away from crypto in general. On the other hand, it might make them appreciate decentralization more, and teach them that they weren't taking advantage of enough of crypto's unique properties.
~
Crypto has quietly transformed the way many Argentinians move money and access the global economy. The volume of transactions going through crypto is growing rapidly, and it’s increasingly out of the government’s control. However, the way that has played out is quite different from what many crypto enthusiasts have imagined.
Decentralization is a worthy goal, but in practice it seems that most Argentinians don’t care that much about it, at least not in the way purists talk about it. They’re more worried about whether the government can get their hands on their money; as long as the answer is "no", they don’t seem to care much about who else has control over it.
At first, I was surprised to see so many Argentinians using centralized tools to access crypto. But upon reflection, I realized this is exactly what we should expect from human psychology: people implicitly value convenience over preparing for long-tail risks — like the risk of a stablecoin becoming unstable, or an exchange collapsing or being seized by the government — and centralization makes it easier to provide that convenience. 
It’s not until something goes terribly wrong that we start to invest in protecting ourselves from the downside. And plenty has already gone wrong in Argentina’s traditional financial system. So if Argentinians aren’t rushing to embrace decentralized currencies, that says a lot about what we should expect from the rest of the world.

The Chengzhongcun  Urban Traces of the Village

Essay by John Joseph Burns
 
‘To get rich is Glorious’
 
Much of modern China stems from the economic reforms brought in by Deng Xiao Ping in the late 1970’s and since that time an unimaginable and unprecedented expansion has occurred in its urban areas. The vast majority of the urban development we see being developed can be described as the ‘Great Street’ and ‘Vertical Block’ (Hassenflug 2010) which can be argued is in its pace of development creating generic and often soulless urban environments lacking in a sense of place or urban community. This is why looking for traces of the past or lingering urban forms here may be seen as a futile exercise.
Indeed this drive towards progress isn’t just expanding existing urban areas but creating entirely new cities, and in some cases mega-cities. The prime example of Deng Xiao Ping’s fundamental belief that ‘to get rich is glorious’ is the city of Shenzhen, located across the border from the Hong Kong in Guangdong Province. Since 1978 Shenzhen has now expanded into one of the world’s true mega-cities with an unofficial population of around 14 million. This means that what is effectively a modern prosperous metropolis has been created from scratch in a mere 30 years. If you were to look at areas within Shenzhen such as the CBD (Centre Business District) of Futian District you would see the typical urban signatures of any modern city such as grand highways and towering skyscrapers.
However the process of creating Shenzhen, and expanding other urban areas within Guangdong such as Guangzhou and Zhuhai, has had a surprising and fascinating consequence. As Shenzhen expanded it swallowed up the surrounding agricultural land in order to develop an urban landscape. This land was forcibly purchased from the local farmers in order to develop, essentially leaving the local villagers without any real means to sustain themselves. The only thing the villagers owned was their ‘village land’ on which they lived and which was being surrounding by the apparent progress of generic urban development (Song, Zenou & Ding 2003).

Re-Building the Village
China, however Communist it may claim to be, is in fact a modern capitalist state, but there is a hangover from Mao’s time which is completely contrary to the idea of a free market and that is the dual land ownership policy which is still prevalent in China today. Simply put all land is divided into two distinct groups, urban land owned by the state and leased to developers for development and rural land which is owned by a village collective made up of the local inhabitants (Song, Zenou & Ding 2003).
What this means in our story of the development of these urban-locked villages is that the local villagers themselves retained control of their land and by consequence their community. This land despite being surrounded by state owned urban land was in fact a rural piece of land meaning it could be developed independently from the city itself. But the question remained what were the villagers meant to do with this land?
The answer is as pragmatic and capitalist as you can imagine, left with their land as their only asset and seeing a need for affordable housing for rural migrants flocking to the new city they built low income housing (Yan 2008). The form in which they built this is what is truly fascinating; because of the rules governing rural land they could only develop family homes, approximately 10m x 10m. During the thirty years of development these evolved and expanded vertically becoming eight story high residential towers separated by narrow village scale alleyways. The height of these little towers being capped at around eight stories due to the simple fact they don’t have elevators in them. This creates a unique architectural form of the ‘handshake building’, so called because you can reach out and shake the hand of your neighbor.

What is produced is a dense urban landscape, such as Shui Wei Village in Shenzhen which is based on a set of rules developed for rural settlements and a rural scale layout. In fact when they are observed there is no trace to suggest they are a village, they look urban and are urbanized in every sense. However they still retain their villager population and their village communal collective, now rebranded to fit in with the capitalist way forward as a ‘village holding company’. They had become a ‘village-amidst-the-city’ or the Chengzhongcun.

Unregulated Assets
At the time of this expansion upwards and increased density, the mid 1990’s, the city authorities were willing to ignore these Chengzhongcun as they provided low income housing which allowed the rural migrants vital to the creation of the city somewhere to stay (Wu & Webster 2010). However by becoming a magnet for low-income migrants and being independent from the city as a whole lead to lower investment in basic infrastructure and the quality of the built environment is not of the highest quality. Coupled with the fact that these Chengzhongcun seemed to have a higher rate of crime has produced an image of almost near slum status. 
These areas aren’t slums but compared to the brand new ‘fully planed’ developments around them which consist of gated residential high-rises and commercial shopping malls they don’t appear far off. Instead of considering them slums they should be considered as unregulated assets. They are vital to the overall housing needs of the city and they provide small scale economic opportunities which are not catered for in the larger developments (Yan 2008). In fact it is because these areas have not been planned that they are valuable. The local villagers weren’t developers and were taking a pragmatic approach to their own survival; they went from ‘growing crops to growing homes’ (Song, Zenou & Ding 2003).
But in order for these Chengzhongcun to have survived for so long and to have prospered there must be some fundamental benefits of their composition other than their low-income rooms for rent. They are an asset, but more than just an economic fix that the government didn’t allow for, they have other benefits unique to their spatial dynamics.
 
A Rural Urbanism
The Chengzhongcun are an easy target for the city authorities, with a large low-income rural migrant population, reports of widespread crime and poor infrastructure (Campanella 2008), but from an urban point of view they are infinitely fascinating. This is because they are not a completely new form of urbanism or even a form which is based on previous principles or rules. They are an organic and pragmatic continuation of a rural Chinese spatial layout. The trace of the once existent village remains in the urban layout but hidden in the scale of the urban development.
When viewed amongst the cityscape the Chengzhongcun present a very different set of spatial conditions for daily life to carry on in compared to the great streets and vertical blocks of the rest of the city. Fuxin Village shows a fully ‘urbanized’ village set in a strict grid with replicated ‘handshake buildings’ which provide the built fabric. But when examined with a little scrutiny these Chengzhongcun can be seen as a microcosm of urban life, an antonymous urban block.

Each Chengzhongcun has its own school, hospital, village holding company office, local history museum, public gathering space (some even have their own amphitheater for outdoor performances). Apart from just these public services the area is alive with bustling small businesses which populate the ground and even first floors of the ‘handshake buildings’. The high density of these varied activities brings a sense of unity and consolidation to the overall environment. It may seem at first that the incredible density which characterizes these areas would be a problem, but which is the factor that actually serves to make them a success living environment.
An issue which the surrounding city has, which the Chengzhongcun doesn’t, is the distance its inhabitants have to travel to certain amenities, such as from their homes to the supermarket or their workplace. The high density and varied land use within the Chengzhongcun allows for its residents to be walking distance from everything they need, including employment. This scale means that the local villagers have retained their almost insular village lifestyle but have the added benefit of having a mega-city and the benefits that brings on their doorstep.
However this density must be brought into context of what it is like to live within one of these urban landscapes. The Chengzhongcun is a vibrant place which is alive twenty-four hours a day and there is a constant hum of activity. The ‘handshake buildings’ over look one another and it is easy to see directly into your neighbor’s living room. These facts should not be considered a negative, but they are the consequences of living at such a high density. It can be argued that such a model of living would not be acceptable in a Western society but in the Chinese context and culture this model is perfectly acceptable and actually thrives.

The boundaries between private and public within the Chengzhongcun as so blurred that even your own home becomes part of the public realm being overlooked. It can be said that this layered living actually reinforces a sense of inclusion and a sense of belonging almost, a sense of belonging to a place and a community. Unlike living in a faceless gated high-rise were you are sealed in your own apartment, living in the Chengzhongcun binds you to a place, you are constantly aware of the environment you are living in and constantly feel part of a wider social group. This is perhaps how a social trace of a village community has remained despite all physical traces of the village disappearing.
The constant flow of daily life spills out onto the alleyways and brings with it a vibrancy which can only come from people living on top of other people. The constant social interaction and the constant feeling of an urban society that is ever present within your life. The fact that everything you need from supermarkets to workplaces to entertainment is literally round the corner. These are elements that a mega-city designed in zones of activities and connected by vast transport links can’t replicate and these are the exact characteristics that give the Chengzhongcun their atmosphere and sense of place.
 
Traces of the Past – Superficial & Meaningful
When viewing these Chengzhongcun they appear fully urbanized and little remains of their rural past, but there are urban and architectural fragments which show the history that is inherit in these places. Many of these Chengzhongcun retain an ancestral temple which in some like Xiasha Village is given pride of place or in Nantou Village where the original village gate and in Huanggang where original houses are hidden amongst the ‘handshake buildings’. These built fragments of a collective past have been important enough to retain and maintain through urbanisation.

These elements add yet another unexpected layer to these Chengzhongcun that adds to the duplicity inherits in the nature of these areas. In order to survive they have had to pragmatically strip away their past to become sustainable but have retained small fragments of history which have been deemed important to them. Again this simply reinforces the sense of village community.
However retaining some small village temples is a minor yet superficial way of retaining your culture. What is more fascinating is that the gridiron layout of these Chengzhongcun is not merely an enforced urban form which best utilises the available land, it itself is a form of conservation which can’t be immediately observed. If we consider villages like Huang Bei Ling which hasn’t fully been urbanized yet it is clear to see the gridiron pattern of development which the ‘handshake buildings’ is based on is in fact taken form pervious village layouts. This means that the alleyways, which are extremely narrow has been an inherited inherent Chinese feature brought forward organically. It isn’t only that it is acceptable to have high density in a Chinese context but that density has always been present and the social acceptability of density is much greater than say in the West at present.

Not much of the physical past may remain within these villages, apart from a few preserved ancestral temples and some built fragments but that isn’t actually what is important to survive. What can be said to be the real important traces of the past is the spatial dynamic, perhaps not vertically, but in terms of the appropriate scale and relation of building to building. When examined these new urbanized villages are built in clustered grids just as the original village was. The true trace has been ingrained into the pragmatic urban response to surviving forced urbanisation. This is why these Chengzhongcun aren’t merely slums packed as tight as they can be, they have an urban form which has developed and which has been tried and tested and accepted by its inhabitants.

Collectivity through Individuality
Only in China can the most extreme form of urbanisation be said to have a
rural community at the heart of it. The Chengzhongcun are a fascinating phenomenon, they are an example of an organic Chinese urbanism in which density and scale have shown that a successful urban community can be developed that is not the standard commercial podium and vertical block that characterize the modern Chinese city. In fact an urbanism with community and social interaction, one which has grown out of a rural beginning can sit just as comfortably within the context of that most 21st century form of a mega-city like Shenzhen.So how can you best describe a Chengzhongcun? Well, I would describe them as Collectivity through Individuality. In terms of all scales, from one-to-one details to the overall layout of ‘handshake buildings’ there simultaneously exists this feeling of a strong collective community and yet a sense of personal expression. What I mean is, even in built form, each ‘handshake building,’ although individual and unique, combined with the overall mass presents a visual and spatial cohesion. This nature reflects itself in every social aspect as well from the idea of ancestral history to individual family shrines, from the Village Holding Company to individual family businesses within the ‘village’. Perhaps this is the ultimate clash of an inherited communist collective system with the individualistic free market translated into the built form of Chengzhongcun.
One thing I can conclude with certainty is the value of the Chengzhongcun. I believe if you truly want to understand contemporary China then you should try and understand the Chengzhongcun. The traces of history mixed with pragmatic development, the hap-hazard approach and determination to achieve progress, the self-regulation and social cohesion, the density and intense atmosphere of social interaction are all elements that are present at all levels of Chinese society. Here in the Chengzhongcun they are exaggerated and amplified given an insight into the Chinese mindset. For me the Chengzhongcun are in their way a summary of China at this moment in time. To have architecture achieve this is quite special, it was organically produced from the people themselves and the value lies with the villagers and migrants who live in these places, the people who produce the vibrant lifestyle and preserve the ancestral heritage and create their shared communal living. It is that quintessential Collectivity through Individuality that is so appealing and produces these fascinating communities and fascinating communal urban space that is uniquely Chinese.

May 31st, 2018
Today I learned of the existence of Copenhagen Suborbitals, the "world's only manned, amateur space program". From their website:
Since 2011, we’ve built and flown 5 homebuilt rockets and space capsules from a ship in the Baltic Sea, and some day one of us will fly into space. It’s all crowdfunded and nonprofit, and has only come this far because people all over the world donate money that pay the materials, tools and rent. Our goal is simple: To fly an amateur astronaut into space and safely back. It’s a unique dream and we can’t think of a more fun and exciting project. When Edmund Hillary was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest he replied: "Because it’s there".
Space is defined by the Kármán line at 100 km above Earth, so the plan is to fly a space capsule with our astronaut straight up to just over that altitude, from where it free fall straight back and land by parachute in the sea. Copenhagen Suborbitals is the only space organisation that launches rockets from a sailing platform in international waters, since it’s virtually impossible to get permission to do it from the ground in any country.
I love that this exists. It's a little insane—it seems like the sort of project dreamt up over a few too many beers, one friend saying "Wouldn't it be so cool if we made a rocket?" followed with the response: "Well, why not?".

Who knows if this one specifically will work. That's almost besides the point (though I'm certainly rooting for them!). What I like about it is that they took a challenge that's an idiom for something impossibly hard (Copenhagen Suborbitals is literally doing rocket science) and decided to see just how possible it was. I'd love to see more small groups of people take it upon themselves to try things that everyone assumes to be impossible. Much of the time the pessimistic consensus is right, but every once in a while you get a lot further than anyone expected. And even if it doesn't succeed it sure makes a great story!

                  Notes on the streetcars vs buses debate
                  

September 3rd, 2018
This was originally published in Oct 2015.

It's a controversial question whether streetcar (also known as trams, trolleys) or bus rapid transit systems (BRT) are a better investment to solve cities' challenge of offering short-distance transit options. The two offer similar stop spacing, and both share the road with cars. However, they differ greatly in their cost structure, flexibility, and public image. Some notes on the subject...

The argument for buses
Buses are much more cost-effective.An alternatives assessment in Washington D.C. compared an extension westward from the H Street line to Georgeton. It found:Construction costs of the bus line were ~2/3 that of the streetcar, and ongoing maintenance was ~1/3. (The streetcar option would cost $348 million to build, with annual costs of $9.1 million. The "premium bus" route which in some places would have a dedicated lane would cost $214 million to build, with annual costs of $3.3 million.)Streetcars last longer. In a recent Portland plan, streetcars cost $3.5 million per vehicle and last 30 years; buses cost $430,000 per vehicle, but last only 15 years. The amortized costs are $117 thousand and $29 thousand per year for a streetcar and a bus, respectively.The streetcar would move 6-14% faster than the bus, and it can carry more riders per trip.Rachel Dovey of Next City described streetcars as the "Lululemon yoga pants or iPhone Whichever—a Whole Foods version of public transit serving Yuppie developers and tourists more than residents who actually need to get around".Buses are far more flexible and in turn much lower risk.A bus system can be introduced, adjusted, and removed far more cheaply and easily than streetcars. If transit need declines or shifts to a different neighborhood, it is very difficult to adjust streetcar lines along with that demand. A streetcar system can accomodate only critical changes. In contrast, buses can iteratively adjust their routes according to need.Introduction of a bus system requires less buy-in from the community, because their construction is much less intrusive and permanent than fixed track streetcars.Streetcar tracks in the road are a hazard for cyclists.
"Where a streetcar is faster or more reliable than the bus route it replaced, this is because other improvements were made at the same time -- improvements that could just as well have been made for the bus route," notes public transit consultant Jarrett Walker. For example, streetcar projects often replace bus pullouts with island platforms, which solves the problem of the public car merging back into traffic. However, this street design change could just as easily and more cheaply be made for existing bus routes without entirely replacing the existing bus infrastructure. He notes that packaging the improvements as a part of an exciting new streetcar project can be a good strategy for pushing them through, but they are "logically independent".The argument for streetcars
Positive cultural associations and aesthetics.Streetcars offer a smoother and quieter ride than buses.Steel tracks make it easy to find stops and to see where the streetcars are headed. This is particularly comforting for newcomers to a city.Fixed tracks make the entire experience feel more predictable and controlled than buses.It's hard to deny that streetcars are cute, especially relative to buses. Riders love the historical aesthetic, and streetcars don't have the stigma that buses carry for serving typically lower income communties. Blumenauer explains that streetcars play to people's "nostalgia for a slightly different time".Opponents argue that these aesthetic characteristics are trivial and petty. However, transit officials are always looking for ways to make public transit more attractive for middle class commuters who overwhelmingly depend on cars even for short distances within most American cities. The comparative comfort and friendliness of streetcars shifts ridership from automobiles to public transit more effectively than stigmatized buses. If widely adopted, this could hugely decrease congestion and the environmental impacts of Americans' dependence on cars, which many argue is worth the extra cost.
"People who wouldn’t get on a bus at gunpoint will take the Metro. And the streetcar’s even friendlier because it’s aboveground."

– Earl Blumenauer, Portland's former commissioner of public works

Streetcars may promote economic development more effectively.A 2008 report by Portland's transpit department found that developers built out 90% of the allowable density within one block of the streetcar route, while they built out just 43% on properties three or more blocks from the route.Before Portland's line was built through the central business district (CBD) in 1997, just 19% of development occurred within a block of today's streetcar lines. Today, 55% of development within the CBD occurs along that streetcar corridor.A D.C. planning study found an expected 5-12% increase in property values along proposed streetcar corridors. However, the report notes this also posed "the possibility of dislocation [in] neighborhoods with lower household incomes and higher propotions of renters". Streetcar proponents argue that increased demand will be balanced by new development, but the density regulations featured by most American cities are sure to offset this phenomenon in certain neighborhoods, resulting in increased rental prices.#transit

December 29th, 2018
January 28, 2016  By Tiago Forte
We’ve been told for years now that what our parents and kindergarten teachers told us is not, in fact, true — we are not each and every one of us special unique snowflakes destined for greatness. In this essay I want to offer a new theory of productivity for those of us who, despite all the evidence to the contrary, still believe there is something valuable about our particular point of view. I will argue that the fundamental driver of creative work today is not values, goals, or processes, but unique states of mind.

Two identical snowflakes, via the NYTLet’s start by taking this idea to unreasonable extremes: hyper-advanced aliens and digital souls.
My favorite alien race is The Festival from Charles Stross’ sci-fi novel Singularity Sky. It is a civilization evolved thousands of years beyond our own, for whom space and time and matter are mere playthings. Having long ago outgrown the drudgery of science and progress, they use their godlike powers to roam the universe in a carnivalesque menagerie of spaceships, partying through each galaxy in search of intelligent life.
What The Festival are looking for is not life for its own sake, but unique stories. They’ve reached the conclusion that only the life narratives of sentient beings hold intrinsic, ultimate value. In exchange for the stories of an Earth-like planet’s inhabitants, they supply "cornucopia machines," unimaginably advanced 3D printers that can make anything on demand. The result is predictable: everyone immediately makes weapons and annihilates each other (amusingly, this story was cited by a senior lecturer in war studies at King’s College as inspiration for a proposal to undermine the Taliban by giving every Afghani a cellphone). This series of events is entirely satisfactory from The Festival’s point of view: they value stories more than life itself, and Extinction by Overabundance is a satisfyingly ironic one.
In Altered Carbon and its sequel Broken Angels, Richard Morgan describes a future society where people’s minds and memories are stored on small chips inserted at the base of the neck. These "digital souls" are bought and sold in "soul markets," dingy street fairs displaying baskets of chips categorized by function: hackers, artists, mothers, assassins. Some minds are highly prized and come at a premium; others can be bought in bulk. Older ones fall in value, but eventually rise again as they become antiques sought by people who want to experience extinct states of mind.
The story revolves around traditionalist Catholics who are being targeted for murder. They don’t believe the true soul can be stored on a chip (Luddites!) — thus their refusal to be "resleeved" into new bodies means they cannot be resurrected to testify against their murderers in court, making them easy victims. The plot device that unfolds is a common trope in sci-fi: the problem (or in this case, crime) can only be solved by a particular personality, a unique configuration of beliefs, memories, perspectives, and quirks that can be virtualized, but never simulated.
Both these stories hint at an idea found in both sci-fi novels and current artificial intelligence debates: that subtle shades of subjective consciousness are the only irreducible, indivisible things in the universe —  the quarks out of which souls and narratives are built. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, the implications of this idea can shed light on a much more immediate problem: productivity, from the day-to-day "checking of boxes" kind all the way to the "living a generative life" variety.
Let’s rewind a bit. Productivity as we know it is based on delayed gratification, which described a world that was predictable and structured. It was clear what you had to do and in what order — it was just a matter of scheduling and pain tolerance. But delayed gratification is obsolete in a world dominated by VUCA, because the pain you’re pulling into the present might not even be necessary, and the gratification you’re pushing into the future might never materialize. It is not at all clear what must be done and in what order; in fact, it becomes ever more clear that most of the tasks we execute don’t make much of a difference, while a tiny percentage randomly and dramatically influence the course of our work and our lives. It makes sense to invest more and more resources in making that distinction, because the absolute fastest way to complete a task or reach an objective is to realize you don’t have to.
As the number of things we have to know and do to achieve that traditional level of security has exploded, a new generation of process-first productivity frameworks has emerged with step-by-step flowcharts and diagrams to help us decide between them. These frameworks sidestep questions like "What COULD I do?" and "What SHOULD I do?" in favor of a much more tractable, interim one: "What CAN I do?" This is most clearly embodied in the concept of "contexts." It says that the governing organizational principle of your To Do list should be the context you find yourself in at any given moment. Instead of one massive To Do list that you have to decipher every time you glance at it, you should divide the list into "context lists" based on the tools at your disposal, the location you find yourself in, your energy level, the person you’re with, or other constraints. You only look at one of these lists at a time, since there’s no use seeing tasks that require a phone call when you’re on a flight, or seeing difficult creative tasks when you’re exhausted on a Friday afternoon.
But access to tools, locations, and people is no longer the primary constraint in doing valuable work. Nor do "energy levels" come close to capturing the subtleties of human motivation. I believe we’re entering a new era: Mood-First Productivity. States of mind, or more colloquially, moods, are bubbling up to the surface as every external constraint on work falls away, one after the other.
A good example is melancholy, which research and old literature indicate is associated with creativity, but is not easy to create on demand. Another is the "New York state of mind," that inspiring mixture of sophistication and grittiness. It is inspiring, but also expensive (requires a plane ticket), illegible (who can define it?), affective (not based in facts), and ephemeral (comes and goes).
This leads us to a definition for "state of mind":difficult or expensive to reproduce (in contrast to simple emotions)illegible and more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts (in contrast to cause-and-effect habits)primarily somatic and affective, not intellectual (in contrast to belief systems or worldviews)temporary and ephemeral (in contrast to mindsets or attitudes)Other examples of mood states that fit this definition include ennui, nostalgia, transcendence, optimal drunkenness, motivated curiosity, petrichor after-rain smell, flow states, Burning Man, and eustress (just enough stress to motivate you to get things done).
A given state of mind is difficult to reproduce even for someone who’s experienced it in the past, often requiring elaborate rituals or particular combinations of past experiences (or drugs). They often elude those who seek them for purely instrumental ends. Long meditation sessions can produce some highly useful states (for example, enhanced focus ability), but reaching that state is terribly expensive in terms of time investment. This is why you’ll be disappointed if you do meditation only for specific outcomes like "increased attention span" or "Big Picture thinking." It only makes sense as a more fundamental firmware hack, with any side benefits counted as lucky bonuses.
What makes this interesting in the business world is that states of mind, unlike productivity frameworks and business models, are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to imitate. Cultural states of mind powerfully resist measurement and analysis, because they flow through the little understood channels of the human subconscious. A new crop of "culture summits" and "culture analytics" companies has arisen with new step-by-step frameworks and measurement tools for "creating a good culture," but let’s just say I’m a skeptic.
States of mind drastically influence the amount of energy it takes to complete a given task, which gives them leverage. When you’re in Errand Mode, running an additional errand not only doesn’t take much extra energy, it actually increases your energy as you feel the delicious alignment of necessity with inertia. Similarly, we often forget that the first stage in reaching that "state of flow" we all crave is actually struggle. You cannot reach the state of "optimal experience" — what Daniel Goleman describes as "a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task" — without that initial feeling of anxiety and fidgetiness. This is the true toll of constant interruptions: with each distraction you stop and start the process again and again, never quite getting past the struggle stage to the flood of mood-enhancing neurochemicals.
There are tantalizing hints everywhere of an awakening around the importance of states of mind for creative knowledge work.
For example, Sarah Perry recently described "borrowed-scenery creativity," the practice of using background scenery as an element in your composition. I cannot think of a better example of a "background" to mental processes than moods.
David Allen, in the 2015 revision of Getting Things Done, describes the long-term path to GTD Mastery: "…optimally taking advantage of self-created contexts and triggers to produce creative ideas, perspectives, and actions that wouldn’t normally occur." What is a "self-created context" if not a purposefully created state of mind?
But my favorite one comes from Josh Waitzkin, in The Art of Learning:
"In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus."
The key words there are "feeds itself." Learning new facts and gaining new perspectives is valuable as raw material, but the moment of creative breakthrough is almost always driven by a mysterious internal process variously called the Muse, the Resistance, and the Gift. Only internal feedback loops can reach the speed and internal coherence necessary for the act of synthesis.
There’s also research support. This HBR report and this Scientific American article describe studies showing that unusually creative people are characterized by "their ability to mix seemingly incompatible states of being depending on the task, whether it’s open attention with a focused drive, mindfulness with daydreaming, intuition with rationality, intense rebelliousness with respect for tradition, etc." (also called "blends of emotions"). Affective engagement — the extent to which people are open to the full breadth and depth of their emotions — was found to be a better predictor of artistic creativity than IQ or intellectual engagement. Meanwhile, Gallup reports that 87 percent of global workers are either unengaged or actively disengaged from their workplaces.

How I view "blends of emotions" – even starting with a limited number of basic emotions, each small overlapping section is potentially a unique state of mind, suited for a particular kind of work, via ImgurThis leads to one of my more controversial beliefs: that in the near future companies will offer their employees a full range of psychotherapeutic, psychosomatic bodywork, cognitive behavioral therapy, and related services as a means to expanding their emotional engagement and enhancing their performance. They’ve caught on to the power of external spaces and experiences as a means of enhancing perceptual filters, and this inner work will be a natural counterpart. The emerging organizational framework of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) seeks to "evaluate the overall resourceful state of workers" in terms of self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope — this is the right idea, but I think these are better described as ephemeral states of mind, not some sort of commoditized resource.
My point here is that I believe states of mind are not just cool trips, but concrete competitive assets. Their irreproducibility makes them a good candidate for the "stash of hoarded unfair advantages" that makes entrepreneurship hard. The more states you have access to, and the better you are at juggling them from situation to situation, the more you will be able to leverage intellectual knowledge with more-difficult-to-Google tacit knowledge.
For me personally, giving states of mind their due has helped me understand how misfortunes, undesired circumstances, and mid-life crises can become the seeds of great strengths: people avoid these things so aggressively that the states of mind they impart are rare, and valuable. I used to regret growing up in insular suburban Southern California, but have come to treasure what it gave me: naïveté, the ability to throw myself into new things with evangelical zeal, which I trace directly back to my upbringing in an evangelical Christian mega-church and a conservative social bubble. I’ve left behind the beliefs but fortunately retained access to the state of mind. Likewise, the most useful book I’ve ever read isn’t a non-fiction self-help tract. It is a historical fiction novel called The Source, by James Michener. It follows a fictional archaeological expedition as they dig up an ancient settlement in modern-day Palestine. At every layer they uncover an artifact, and each chapter tells the story of that artifact, from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War all the way back to the first hominids. Reading that book again and again as an impressionable teenager, it slowly gave me a sense (or state of mind) that history is inherently epic and meaningful. Whether you agree or not, it is a useful state of mind to have at your disposal during moments of existential dread.
I’ve also come to appreciate that every state of mind is highly adapted to a specific context, like a specialized tool. The two foreign cultures I’m most familiar with are Brazil (part of childhood) and Ukraine (Peace Corps) — they each represent radically different but effective responses to environments of great uncertainty. Brazilian culture says that the social reality is the only reliable reality, which is not a bad guide to what research tells us is essential for happiness. Eastern Ukraine has more of a grim, stoic determination — excellent for intellectual pursuits. I once sat in the living room of a Ukrainian family in a small village, being schooled at chess by one of my English students. His mother yelled from the kitchen, "Vlad! Stop playing that game and do your homework!" in exactly the same tone of voice an American mother would use for video games. I thought: how useful a state of mind it must be to think of chess as a guilty pleasure, instead of a chore? And we wonder how the Slavic world continues to churn out world-class mathematicians and scientists with a fraction of our education budget.
So what do we do with this information? We’ve muddied the waters beyond simple prescriptions like "follow your passion" or "develop useful skills." Mood-first productivity may even seem disheartening, like we are slaves to our emotions. But I think states of mind can shed new light on an old idea: that we are actually different selves across time, and reaching our goals requires getting them to cooperate. The main difference between these selves is not information content. It is in their respective states of mind—how they feel about themselves and their place in the world.
This excellent paper on "Self-Organization in Communicating Groups" by Francis Heylighen at the Free University of Brussels (which I’ll be borrowing from liberally) describes the four requirements for any group of independent "agents" to reach a goal. I want to use this framework to ask the question: What if we thought of our different selves as literally completely different people, with different priorities, skills, and attitudes? How could we use principles of self-organization to get them to work together toward common goals, assuming they are driven primarily by ephemeral states of mind?
The four requirements are:Alignment: getting the selves to push in the same direction, so they’re not fighting against each otherSpecialization: getting the selves to complement each others’ efforts by focusing on the activities they are best suited forWorkflow: getting the selves to hand off tasks to each other efficiently, so they can be completed in stages over timeAggregation: the assembly of the results of the previous activities into a final productIf we consider that our numerous selves have very different priorities, aligning their actions becomes more important, and harder. Instead of forcing all of them—past, present, and future—to line up with an unchanging predetermined outcome (a "mission" or "purpose"), it makes more sense to start with what excites your current self right now, and then work from there to define that motivation in increasingly subtle shades over time. The more precise your understanding of what exactly excites you about any particular project, the better your ability to generalize it to other projects and topics — to thread and follow that particular needle winding through the haystack of life.

Assuming these numerous selves have different skills, it makes sense for them to specialize. But that means we need a mechanism for matching each self to the right task. There are two basic ways of doing this: learning how to change your mood to match the task at hand, and to change the task at hand to match your mood. Both are useful under different circumstances. Changing your mood to match the task is the realm of self-talk and environmental cues, like the Cathedral Effect — a team working in a high-ceilinged room will use more abstract and integrated ideation, while a team in a low-ceilinged room will use more discrete and concrete approaches. Changing the task to match your mood is the goal of distributed, self-organizing tools like kanban boards and ticketing systems, where each person works on whatever matches their skills and state of mind at that moment. Personal kanban boards are an example of applying these tools to a team of selves, instead of a team of people.

Because these different selves show up rather unpredictably at different times, workflow is required to coordinate their actions across time. Heylighen provides a clue: "There is no need to plan when a particular agent should execute a particular task, as long as enough agents are available so that a sufficiently skilled one is ready to take over soon after the previous task is finished." That’s a hefty requirement. This means that Calm but Focused Me needs to be able to hand off whatever he’s working on to another instance of Calm but Focused Me in such a way that both the current progress and the state of mind are preserved as accurately as possible. Because these two instances are often separated by days, weeks, or months (in an environment of numerous simultaneous projects and constant emergencies), this handoff cannot rely on storing these states in memory, nor can it deteriorate over time.

This requirement is the real motive for an iterative summarization approach to note-taking (briefly, summarizing notes, and then summarizing the summary, etc. in a pyramid-like structure, using formatting that allows you to see each level of summarization separately). It’s relatively time-consuming, but I’m willing to put in all of that effort because, when the creative mood appears, I want to be able to integrate as many sources as possible before that temporary state of mind passes (or the responsibilities of real life come knocking). I’m time-shifting as much mundane reading and summarizing as possible from that future, precious, creative state of mind to other, more common mental states: Delay on BART, Relaxing After Dinner, On a Plane, Dentist’s Appointment, etc.
In other words, the true purpose of note-taking is transporting states of mind (not just information) through time. This is why pictures, sketches, and diagrams often work better than text. We don’t usually think of them as notes, but songs, smells, and tastes work even better. As HBR puts it: "A visual model becomes one of the most effective tools for minimizing alignment-attrition; a visualization formalizes an emergent idea and solidifies it at a moment in time." Or as Craig Mod more eloquently says, "To return to a book is to return not just to the text but also to a past self. We are embedded in our libraries. To reread is to remember who we once were, which can be equal parts scary and intoxicating."
There is one bright side to all this hard work: the only way to crystallize a state of mind is to use affective triggers to decide what to take notes on and keep. Instead of making a mini-outline of each book and article and podcast you consume, trying to preserve the logical structure of the argument, just wait in low-power mode for reactions like surprise, delight, intrigue, and outrage. This System 1 processing is much faster, less energy intensive, and more intuitive than the more analytical System 2. To take this approach means your notes will not be neat and ordered, like a Dewey Decimal system for the mind. They will be dominated by the contrarian, by paradoxes, by the inexplicable. Which is exactly the point. Contrarianism is the fastest method for discovering the paradox at the heart of every inexplicable phenomenon.
Aggregation is necessary to turn all these diverse efforts into a final product. Having access to more diverse states of mind allows you to create more diverse definitions of success — a crucial skill for shaping and moving into zones of expanding possibility. If you’ve endured just a taste of Kafka’s maddening bureaucracy, you can be ok with a little extra paperwork. This is Waitzkin’s first level of high-performance — flowing with whatever comes. If you’ve learned how to find boredom useful by, say, keeping a stash of reading material handy at all times, you can find that 2-hour delay to be an opportunity. This is the second level — using whatever comes to your advantage.

What I’m referring to here is multifinality. Whereas multitasking refers to seeking multiple outputs from multiple simultaneous inputs, and is impossible, multifinality refers to attaining alternative objectives from the same inputs, and is eminently possible. Can that ad campaign also be an opportunity to test the relative performance of different market segments? Can this presentation be recorded and used as a business development tool? Can captchas also be used to decipher street addresses? These questions allow you to kill two birds with one stone, each present self making life easier on multiple future selves in an expanding, branching tree of optionality. Crucially, multifinality doesn’t take more time or resources or effort — just a more diverse set of lenses to see that any action can have multiple non-rivalrous outcomes.

If you’ve been thinking it’s strange to think of diverse life experiences and inner work as a means to something as mundane as productivity, you’re right — the reverse is true. It’s more accurate to say that productivity, or creating more value in the world as efficiently and effectively as possible, is one of many paths on a journey of personal growth. We just happen to be lucky enough to live in a time when personal growth makes us better employees, which means our employers will pay us to pursue it.
Many have commented on the rise of chaos and complexity in the modern world, but we forget what the yogis have always known — our inner lives have always been chaotic and complex. States of mind are a better guide to modern work than values (which don’t always motivate), goals (which often change), and processes (which try to prescribe the unprescribable) precisely because moods are the only things that change just as fast as the world around us. I suspect this is where that elusive Level 3 of performance can be found — clearing the in-between space of enough biases, fears, and defenses that our inner inspirations can explode into creative "earthquakes" as efficiently as possible.
The idea that difficult inner work will go mainstream seems far-fetched, I know, but I see more and more evidence. Some of the most talked-about books in Silicon Valley have titles like The Untethered Soul, Radical Acceptance, and Spark Joy. Brené Brown explains on a popular podcast aimed at young male urbanites how vulnerability — "the willingness to show up and be seen when you have zero control over the outcome " — underlies all acts of real courage. Courage, of course, being more necessary than ever, and vulnerability as difficult as it’s always been. This interest in the quality of the experience over mere outcomes reminds me of a quote by Joseph Campbell: "People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life,…[but] I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of life, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive." There’s that uncomfortable word rapture again.
Thinking about the value inherent in every unique state of mind, and how one can actively pursue and assimilate these states, I’m struck by a quote by Picasso: "It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child." You could say that his work was a technology of forgetting. It’s encouraging to realize that many of the states of mind we seek are not "out there" somewhere, to be hunted down and consumed. They are states of mind belonging to our past selves — we wouldn’t crave it if we had never experienced it. We have to go backwards and remember what we once knew, not forwards to some perfected version of ourselves. What would you pay to experience child-like wonder for a day? To watch Star Wars Episode IV for the first time again? To have the ability to snap your fingers at any time and see your writing, your painting, your app with the fresh eyes of a novice?
Your future lies in your past. Learning is forgetting. We’re getting close to a paradox here — a promising sign.
For the comments: what states of mind do you find most useful, unique, or interesting?

 On bounties
                  On bounties
                  

October 12th, 2020
Michael Kaminsky recently emailed me an interesting post he wrote about bounties in open source, and I took the opportunity to write up some thoughts that had been swirling in my head for a while. You can find the (lightly edited) response I sent to him below.
~
Bounties are great for well-scoped, low-context work. For example, bounties work can quite well for things like penetration testing, because it's fairly clear what the objective is (specifically: prove that you can wreak havoc on a system) and the task itself requires no collaboration with the core team of the project (in fact it's even better to have no collaboration, because that simulates a blackhat hacker's circumstances more closely).

However I'm not so bullish on the idea of bounties for ambiguous, high-context work. And my view is that (A) ambiguous, high-context work is much more central to the success and innovation of any sort of project, not just open source ones, and (B) people with the capacity and desire to do ambiguous, high-context work are what open source projects tend to be most sorely lacking.If penetration testing is on one extreme of the well-scoped/low-context spectrum, then defining the vision for a project is an example of a responsibility that lies on the opposite end. There are a lot of types of work in between that may benefit from something akin to bounties, and those are all valuable, but what I'm most eager to solve is "how do we develop more leaders who can give life force to open source projects?"

~

On top of that, there are some challenging dynamics around bounties. Just to name a few:

A. Bounty allotment: Alice is the maintainer of Foo, and Bob is making his first contribution ever. Bob opens a PR to resolve an issue that someone put a bounty on, Alice reviews it, and then she merges it. Who gets the bounty? Does Bob deserve it as the author of the PR? Or does Alice deserve it as the maintainer who created/cares for the project, thus making it possible for Bob to create a PR in the first place? Do you split it in half?

One idea — You could solve this with a concept of equity, where the maintainer gets X% of any bounty and that's determined up front. Determining the right values that various folks get could be tricky, but perhaps the maintainers could just set that themselves from the beginning. This would have a very similar shape to startup founders deciding how much equity they get vs how much their employees may get. I'd need to think this through a lot more before I actually recommended it as a solution, but it's a first pass!

B. The spec isn't the territory: How do you determine if the bounty terms were met? Defining a spec is hard work, and it's never airtight. Plus, the best engineers will reframe a problem you pose rather than following exactly what you describe as a solution. This is a bit of a the-map-isn't-the-territory type of problem. The only way to define a spec completely is to write the code yourself! Of course that's taking the problem to ad absurdum, but it underscores the main point that it could be tricky for the developer and bounty poster to agree to whether or not something was met.

C. Race conditions: What happens if Bob and Charlie both work on the same bountied issue, and then open PRs on the same day? How does Alice choose whose PR to accept, and thus who earns the bounty? One way you could solve this is to tell contributors to "lock" the issue while they're working on it, but then what if they never finish it? Then, it just wastes everyone's time because no one else is working on that issue in the meantime.

D. Honeypot for (more!) low-quality contributions: Lots of maintainers already say that they're flooded by low-quality contributions. (Lots more detail in Nadia Eghbals's recent book, Working in Public. Highly recommended if you're interested in this topic!) Putting a price tag on issues would only accelerate this.
This could be mitigated by making the bounties only visible to folks who are part of the project's organization, people who've already made contributions, or some other filter. My point is just that you'd have to think it through, not that it's a dealbreaker.

E. Project coherence: Another failure mode is that bounties could warp maintainer's incentives and ability to execute on the best architecture. A maintainer might want to make one choice because it's a better architectural decision, but then a bounty for a particular feature that pollutes the roadmap is just too temptingly big. 

Even if a maintainer holds fast, it could incentivize more forks because other developers see that bounty just sitting there, waiting to be satisfied. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing, because then the org that posted the bounty is happy without polluting the main project. But it leads to fragmentation (which is sometimes but not always bad) and likely immense tension within the project.

 Chautauqua: an idea embedded in a place


                  Chautauqua: an idea embedded in a place
                  

July 22nd, 2020
I want to tell you about the place I spent summers growing up. It's called Chautauqua Institution, and it's one of the most special places in the world — and not just because I spent my childhood there. Chautauqua is special because it is an idea embedded in a place.

The place is a small town in western New York, on the edge of the Great Lakes. Chautauqua's human-scale streets are lined with lovingly-tended gardens and charming Victorian cottages. No one locks their bicycles, children romp without adult supervision, and neighbors wave from front porches.

The idea embedded in this place is the Chautauqua movement, which began in 1874. It was an experiment in out-of-school learning, whose purpose was to provide an education and access to the arts to those who didn't have the opportunity attend college. 150 years later, the idea is still going strong. Chautauqua is a place of perpetual learning, one where everyone in the tight-knit community values learning new things and encourages each other to do so. 

"The season": Each summer, the community gets together to run 9 weeks of programs offering a wide range of speakers, performances, lectures, concerts, classes, parades, art fairs, theater shows, children's camps, waterfront activities, and more. Chautauquans live for this 9-week period each year, which they call "the Season".

These events are accessible to everyone in the community, which creates a shared context that shows up everywhere. When you order a cone at the ice cream shop, you overhear friendly strangers talking about the concert you saw last night. When you stop by the post office, the postman asks you what you thought of yesterday's Fourth of July parade. In an environment like this, it feels natural to start an interesting conversation with anyone on the street, because they're likely walking back from the same lecture that you just attended, too.

These programs are enjoyable in their own right, but the real value is that they select for people who care about learning and improving their community. There's a real sense of shared values, and many of the programs are run by self-organizing clubs. Chautauqua is a place created by the ~8,000 people who live there every summer, and they've shaped the place to their values.


Chautauqua's special approach to public goods: This is all supported by the Chautauqua Institution, the organization that operates infrastructure for the community to use. They build and maintain lecture halls, an amphitheater, a cinema, and other buildings specifically designed for the Chautauqua community's purposes. The Institution provides a platform for community-run organization to host events on top of without having to make big capital investments.

For example, my grandma was the president of the Bird Tree & Garden Club, and one memorable event they organized was to bring Jane Goodall to Chautauqua and talk about chimpanzees and preservationism. The Institution lent them a pavilion to host the event (rather than the club having to own a building of its own), but the club raised the funds to bring Jane to Chautauqua without the Institution's help. Chautauqua has a great mix of grassroots efforts that adapt to the community's interests as well as high-quality infrastructure at a bigger scale that only the Institution can provide.
No need to lock up your bike at Chautauqua!
So many memories from sitting on the porch. 😊How it grew: Chautauqua's history suggests a path for how to create more places like it. Chautauqua began as a summer school camp for teachers in 1874, and as they came back year after year, they invested in upgrading their canvas tents to little shacks and ultimately to full-fledged houses. Each step naturally flowed from the previous one. No one made any huge leap of faith. Each investment to make the place a little more livable met a real need of the community that was forming there.

The lesson I take from Chautauqua is that you can solve the cold start problem by building a ladder of commitment that people can ascend one step at a time. Instead of offering to build full-fledged homes right out the gate when there’s nothing there yet, host an annual recurring summer camp that people adore. If they come back year after year, they will naturally start to think "how can we make this more permanent?"
Chautauqua began as a temporary 2-weeks-a-year tent camp. It has since evolved into a full-fledged town with comfortable cottages, colorful gardens, and robust infrastructure.
Chautauqua provided opportunities for women in a time when they had little access to education.
Chautauqua is home to the oldest continuous book club in America, the Chautauqua Literary & Scientific Circle.
Chautauqua is so wonderful, but it's also confusing — why aren't there more places like this? Naturally, spending time here in Chautauqua prompts some questions:How could you adapt the Chautauqua format for different purposes and audiences?What would it take to create a successor of Chautauqua today?What places have you been that are like Chautauqua?Why does the programming at Chautauqua run for 9 weeks of the year? How would it change the dynamics if the season were longer or shorter? How does the rise of remote work and nomadic lifestyles change the the opportunities to build a Chautauqua today?
If you have answers, let me know!

 The silence is deafening

                  The silence is deafening
                  

July 2nd, 2020
Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.

In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.1

As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. 

When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.

It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.

This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. 

A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.

This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. You can break the coordination trap! 2

For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.

This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.

Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them more effective. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.Bringing it into a private space3 like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.
I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. 

But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.

Footnotes
Thanks to Sebastián Bensusan and John Backus for reading and providing feedback on drafts of this essay.
1 The technical term for these silent onlookers is "lurkers".2 Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. EDIT 7/4/2020: My friend Zooko evolved this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: "Imagine a "ಠ_ಠ" button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval."3 Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.

                  Fallacies - Ambiguous Collective
                  
clipping

January 25th, 2019
by David King     To commit this fallacy is to use a collective term without any meaningful delimitation of the elements it subsumes.
     "We", "you", "they", "the people", "the system", "the general public", and "society as a whole" are the most widely-used examples.  This fallacy is especially widespread and devastating in the realm of political discussion, where its use renders impossible the task of discriminating among distinctively different groups of people.
     The term "society as a whole" is an assertion that a group of people somehow becomes an entity endowed with attributes other than those attributes possessed by individuals in an aggregate.  It would be better to use the expression "composite" than "as a whole" as this preserves the awareness that the group is merely a collection of independent elements.
     Social problems are difficulties resulting from the interactions of groups of people.  Before a social problem (or indeed any kind of problem) can be solved, it is imperative that the problem be precisely identified.  To identify a social problem, you must delineate precisely the groups of people who are involved in that problem.  The Ambiguous Collective fallacy prevents this identification.
     An antecedentless pronoun is an example in the singular of the Ambiguous Collective fallacy.
     I often challenge those who commit this fallacy to eliminate from their discussion all general collective terms, and each time they want to use such a term to use instead a precisely delimiting description of the group the term is intended to subsume.  Very few people are able to do this.
     I suspect that quite often an Ambiguous Collective is used as an attempt to make a flimsy idea seem more significant or more valid by making the entities it refers to seem larger or more important.
     One reason this fallacy is so prevalent and difficult to deal with is that it is built into the English language.  Consider the question "Do you love anyone?" The ambiguity involved here arises from the fact that the word "anyone" can denote either of two completely different meanings:

1.  An individual, specifiable human being.  A single, particular person, in the sense that there is some one person whom I love.

2.  A non-selected unitary subset of the human race, in the sense that I love whichever person happens to be in my proximity.

     Here are some examples of the Ambiguous Collective fallacy:

"Last November, 77% of us voted in favor of term limits."

     In this statement, who exactly are the "us"?  The speaker wants to convey the idea that term limits are very widely supported, but if in fact the 77% refers only to those who voted, the supporting subgroup may well be a quite small percentage of the total population.

"We need to train doctors to teach us how to get and stay healthy."

     In this statement, who are the "we" and who are the "us"?  Is the speaker trying to promote socialized medicine by advocating government control of the medical schools?  When he says "we need to" does he really mean "the government should"?  And is the "us" merely a subtle way of saying "me"?

     The economic sanctions against South Africa provide an example of the consequences in real life of the Ambiguous Collective fallacy:

     "I imagine you support your government's sanctions against South Africa?"

     "Of course.  Every decent person does."

     "What about disinvestment of American business from my country, you are all for that too?"

     "I campaigned for it on campus.  I never missed a rally or a march."

     "Even if it means a million blacks starve as a direct consequence?  Your plan is similar to trying to convert a country by withdrawing all your missionaries and burning down the cathedral.  You forced your own businessmen to sell their assets at five cents on the dollar.  But it wasn't the impoverished blacks who purchased those assets.  Overnight you created two hundred new millionaires in South Africa, and every one of them had a white face!  That's maliciously stupid!  We would be grateful to you if your efforts had been failures!"

     Perhaps the most widely-known example of the Ambiguous Collective fallacy is the statement:

"Government of the people, by the people, and for the people."

     In this statement "the people" has three distinctly different meanings: One group of "the people" (the victims, or producers) are ruled by another group of "the people" (the bureaucrats, with their action arm, the police) in order to achieve the goals of yet another group of "the people" (the politicians).

Devon: Hello, and welcome to the fifth episode of the Order Without Design podcast. Today's episode is a little different from the previous ones. It's a conversation between Alain Bertaud and our friend, Anthony Ling. Anthony is the editor of Caos Planejado, a website devoted to building better cities in Brazil, Anthony's home. Most of Caos Planejado's content is in Portuguese, but this conversation between Anthony and Alain is in English, so we figured it would be fun to share it with you all. In Portuguese, "caos planejado" means "planned chaos", which is very much in the same spirit of the name of Alain's book, and this podcast, Order Without Design.I'm really excited to share this with you all because Brazil is a country that has a lot of urban growth that is happening right now and frankly a lot of problems that it is working through. But it is also a place with a huge amount of opportunity to improve people's lives through cities. So I'm really happy to share this with you all and for Anthony to be the host of this podcast because he has a really great perspective, having lived in Brazil for most of his life. You can find the original recording of this episode and many more episodes and articles on caosplanejado.com.
Rio de Janeiro, BrazilAnthony: Alain, I believe you studied architecture in the 1960s in the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris? At the time, maybe Le Corbusier was in his 70s, the Athens Charter, maybe the birth of modern urban planning is from 1933. So how was modernist urban planning and Le Corbusier seen in Paris and urban academia at the time that you were studying?
École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, FranceAlain: Well, he became, let's say in the 60s, he became part of the establishment, really. Being a dissenter in the 20s and the 30s, he was attacking the establishment, the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and in the 60s he was literally a god. I mean he was a bull, everybody was admiring him, going to his conference. To the point that in 1963, the study of architecture at the time were very long, it was eight years, you know after admission, so extremely long, with no intermediary degree, by the way. So in 63 I get a little bored by my study at the Beaux-Arts and I decided to take a year off, I mean nine months off. And I went to Chandigarh to work there because Chandigarh at the time were being built and it was considered to be the best type of planning. So it was a little before Brasilia, Chandigarh started earlier. So I went there, by the way, by hitchhiking from Marseilles which could not be done now. But crossing Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and arriving in Chandigarh. I worked there with a cousin of Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, were there. And suddenly living in Chandigarh, if I had been a tourist, probably I would have been convinced that this was a fantastic city. But I was living there.

Chandigarh, India
Alain: You know, I have colleagues, I had to go to the office every morning and suddenly I realized, oh, all this concept of the self-contained sectors with a commercial area in the center and all these things didn't work, really. Not only planning but the architectural thing, to have what they call brise-soleil, to cut the sun with a slab of concrete, which in fact become like ideators. And also the dust before the monsoon accumulate on this slab of concrete and then the wind blow them up inside the room. I mean, everything was wrong. When I was with my colleague we wanted to go to a restaurant, have a drink or even buy some clothes or something, we would go to a slum area. You know people were building Chandigarh as build a slum because they could not afford to live in Chandigarh. So for me this was an awakening, that all the theory that when i read Corbusier I admired, I think this is completely rational. At the time the utopia was functional, something has to be functional. The shape should follow the function and we should not have ornament or anything, the function itself is the thing.

Alain: So that was a utopia and I realized that it doesn't work, you cannot plan a commercial area and decide what type of shop will be there and where they will be. They happen when... in a way the people who open a bakery or restaurant have more information than the planners, so they know where to put it. And that's why they happen in the slum because then it's not only that it's cheaper, it's because there is a freedom of location. So that was my big thing. And I attended two of Corbusier' lecture there and I found him extremely bitter and negative, by the way. He was a very difficult man. So that was the atmosphere at the time. There was also this saying that, if you believe that everything has to be irrational, of course you have your own rationality from where you are. As a Frenchman of the 20th century, and you think that rationality of course is universal and you should impose it on others who are not... so that's why he came... then a bit later was Philip Johnson or Mies Van Der Rohe or the international style, which said, that, again, is rationality. So it's universal, there should not be an archetype of architectural planning which is specific to Brazil or China or India because rationality, it's like mathematics for instance, we are all using the same mathematics. And so the idea that planning will be like mathematics.

Plan Voisin, a planned redevelopment of central Paris designed by architect Le Corbusier in 1925
Anthony: Yeah, yeah. And Alain, you mentioned back then Le Corbusier, at least when he was beginning, he was let's say challenging the mainstream. What was the mainstream before and how were these ideas seen in Paris? For example, Solly Angel mentions about classic urban planning, right? Commissioners' Plan in New York, Cerdà's, Barcelona expansion. Even Haussmann's renovation in Paris. How were these ideas perceived when you were a student, and what were your thoughts back then?

Alain: We thought they were obsolete. You know? And it's all in a way, it's a bit complex. Because on one hand we were living in Paris and we admired Paris. When you walk through Paris you have so many things which are interesting. And at the same time, when Corbusier say we want to destroy the street, the street should disappear. The idea was so radical that it was attractive, even though it's a complete nonsense of course. And especially when you live in Paris when the streets are, because of the lack of zoning, you have a bakery, a hairdresser but also an art gallery completely mixed up. And that's what makes the attraction of Paris, the variety. So strangely I think people enjoy this anti-establishment, a revolutionary kind of thing. The establishment was still rather powerful, including at Ecole Des Beaux-Arts, but they were paying lip service to Corbusier because those idea were very popular among the young. So they will pay some lip service but continue basically, I would say not classic, but kind of an outcome of Art Deco. But in planning pretty much the continuation of the idea of Haussmann or Cerdà.

Alain: So there was this antinomy. And of course the idea of Corbusier, Corbusier never accept Chandigarh and his possible influence in Brasilia, and never building this city. He didn't have any success in urban planning, really, except in the public housing. The government embraced the idea of Corbusier for public housing. Precisely because the people who live there were not the clients. The client, when you build a new city, are the civil servants who are giving you contracts. It is not the people who are going to live in the city. So there is no feedback.

Anthony: Yeah, and I noticed having been to Paris that Parisian suburbs with public housing and the expansion of the Paris metro area is radically different from Paris and probably has a lot of inspiration in Le Corbusier.

Alain: Yeah that's right, because the government intervened. I don't think that there is a private sector, let's say, response to Corbusier. It's always public because you know in a way Corbusier was asking for norms, uniformity and norms. And that is very attractive for civil servants. When they pass contracts if you have norms, this is simple to administer and life is not simple.

Anthony: And what about Haussmann? Haussmann in Paris, maybe today, is there a consensus view about what was done in Paris? And what are your views? I've seen you talking about maybe what he did, Paris could not survive without it maybe.

Haussmann transformed Paris in the mid 1800s. He sliced through the medieval city's winding streets with grand boulevards to enable traffic to cross from one side of the city to the other.
Alain: Yeah, that's right. You know in a large city you need mobility and before Haussmann it was true that Paris was still a medieval city in a large area. You know to have a real idea, there were very few sociological study, but if you read the novels of Balzac, Balzac described housing. And Balzac wrote in 1830, so you know about 20, 30 years before Haussmann. And he described a lot of neighborhood or people living in some neighborhood. And you see that they were really slum, in the same sense that the slum of London described by Dickens. But the problem was not housing, the problem was really moving around the city. And I think Haussmann solved that in a way. But what was... if you compare Haussmann to, say, Robert Moses for instance in New York, the advantage of Haussmann, Haussmann was a real estate operation, it was not an infrastructure operation. He didn't dig a boulevard just to move, like you would move a highway. It was entirely financed by selling land on both side of the boulevard to the private sector. So it was borrowing money from the private sector in real estate, and that I think is the big difference for Brasilia, for instance.

Alain: Brasilia was not financed by the real estate, it was financed by the Brazilian tax payer. Where Paris Haussmann was financed by people who bought land on both side of the new boulevard, so this had to have value that people would recognize. And that's a big difference between this and public housing built by government in the suburbs. So the charm of Paris, in a way, is that along those boulevard, what was built was entirely demand driven although the boulevard themself were top down obviously. But what was built on both side of the boulevard was demand driven.

Anthony: Right, right. So you mentioned Moses and maybe we can move onto your period in New York, actually.

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: So you say you arrived in 1968?

Alain: Yes, January 1968, yes.

Anthony: I believe that was the year Jane Jacobs left New York to move to Toronto?

Alain: Yes exactly, yeah right. You know she had the trial for rioting or something, and I think she had to pay a fine or something and then she moved to Canada, that year. But say, at the time her fight was very much in the news in New York. There was a newspaper which has disappeared now which was called The Village Voice, but that's a very liberal, you know, everybody in the university or even educated people who read, on top of the New York Times. The Village Voice and there were a number of journalists and also writers who write in The Village Voice. So The Village Voice were really the voice of Jane Jacobs at the time, yes. And their continuation, the...

Anthony: Her works, The Death And Life of Great American Cities is from 1961, The Economy of Cities is from 1969. So she was writing in The Village Voice. Was she already an influence within urban planning circles? Did you read her books at the time?

Alain: No, because they were not published yet. I read them four or five years later. I think she wrote her book when she moved to Canada, if I remember well. I don't remember it. But I read about her and it was more, let's say, it was more anti-Moses than pro-Jacobs, in a way. The theory of Jane Jacobs I think most people became familiar with them about 10 years later. Of course anybody who lived in the village, or was close to the village, you know Greenwich Village and the idea that a highway will cross over Washington Park is... in a way this was not a real estate operation, you see like Haussmann, it was an infrastructural operation. To move trucks or cars from, let's say New Jersey to Long Island basically, that was the idea. The idea that a highway like that I think could be justified if it was underground because it would give value to both sides, for instance.

Alain: But say you cut the highway in an existing urban fabric you will have a decrease in value of real estate. You cut Manhattan into two and probably within a kilometer north and south of the highway you will have a semi-dead urban fabric because all the street would be dead ends in the middle of Manhattan. Where in fact Manhattan is a continuity, it's not even... I mean there are some centers like Greenwich Village or Midtown or Wall Street, but those are linked by a continuity, they are not self-sufficient. It's vectors which goes from Wall Street to Harlem. And if you cut, think, it's like cutting a limb. Some parts would become dead. So the real cost of such a highway if it was justified in terms of mobility would be enormous because you had this, the valuation of real estate on both side. My estimate would be about a kilometer on both sides which would lose complete value. And Manhattan in itself, being cut in two, would also lose value. You will have a fragmentation also of the labor market there because of the difficulty of moving back and forth.

Anthony: We've seen in many large Brazilian cities these urban express ways having exactly this affect and there are some discussions today, maybe tearing down some of them. So this is very close to our reality.

Alain: Yeah, to my dismay I found also that sometimes the BRT, you know the bus rapid transit, has the same effect. I found that in Curitiba, some part of Curitiba, but even more in Bogota. If you look at let's say the real estate on both sides of the TransMilenio in Bogota, you see that it's always very low value, it's equivalent of having a value. It could be maybe solved by some urban design thing which allow more... that's possible. But as it is, I think it is a bit a Robert Moses operation. Although BRT of course branch on people all around, so it has a positive side, obviously, it moves a lot of people at a cheap price. But the real estate issue is not solved in the BRT, especially in Curitiba, I mean some part of Curitiba.

Curitiba in Brazil was the first city in the world to implement a full BRT system.
Anthony: Yes, many of the BRTs we have here are indeed very wide and to cross it they built pedestrian walkways which are not very friendly.

Alain: Right, yeah. So that could be solved I suppose with urban design. In my book I don't treat urban design, the book is long enough like that. But I think it's an important part, a complementary part, you know? Again, a park like Washington Square is very effective although it's relatively small, it's four hectares. Very, very effective because it's a good design. But there are parks which are larger which are not very effective because they are not accessible, nobody goes there. So design is a very, very important part of planning and land use in general.

Anthony: Definitely. So Alain, going back to New York and Jane Jacobs, right? So you mentioned your perceptions today about what was the effect of these expressways going through the city. So back then in the late 1960s, 1970s, were you working at city hall in New York?

Alain: My first job was with Philip Johnson, you know the architect Philip Johnson. And it was an incredible experience because it was in the Seagram Building, you know built by Mies Van Der Rohe, it's one of the best skyscrapers in New York, certainly in terms of design. And coming from Paris where I've never been in a building than eight floors, there were no skyscrapers in France at the time. And also the architects in France at the time wanted to give an image of being bohemian, although they were business like everybody else. So they dressed like Che Guevara and everything like that, and suddenly I end up with Philip Johnson. Philip Johnson was always dressed in the best Italian suits and inside the office you had a thing, there was a Giacometti sculpture at the entrance, there was a Picasso tapestry and a Miró tapestry also at the entrance. It was an incredibly different...

Alain: But I quickly found it very boring, although it looked very good on my resume as an architect because there was again this goal thing, it was exactly the same thing as for Corbusier, people worshiped Philip Johnson and I think he was an interesting guy. He was very witty, but I don't think he had a clue about anything, frankly. So it was very frustrating in a way to work there. So after about five or six months I think I started meeting people and thanks by the way to the American culture which is much... as foreigners, we didn't know anybody but we were very quickly invited by all sorts of people. And so we established a network. We had I think a larger network of friends in New York after six months than we had in Paris after five years. So I found a job then in the city planning department. It was the time of Mayor Lindsay and it was a time of the black panther, black power.

Alain: I think they were... I guess, they never told me that, but I guess I was hired because of my French accent. They were desperate to dialogue with the black community but there was such a, let's say, lack of confidence between let's say the white establishment and the black community. That they found I was a nice intermediary in the sense that nobody in Harlem.... well they were not completely sure I was white and they could not identify me in a box because of my accent. So it was much easier for me to relate there. So first I worked next to city hall in the planning department in downtown, then after that we moved into an office in Harlem and then I stayed in Harlem.

Alain: By the way, trying to sell to the community a completely absurd project. The idea, it was a project designed by MIT professors. The idea was to continue Park Avenue into Harlem and by building a vault over the railway which is under Park Avenue and then moving poor people into this new building on both side of Park Avenue, the idea at the time was very common all over the world was, if you built very nice houses for poor people, then the problem is solved. You eradicate poverty by just building nice housing for them.

Alain: At the time Harlem had a lot of problem, crime and drug addiction was incredible. Basically the building on both side of Park Avenue on you know, Lexington and Madison, many of the building were abandoned and just used by junkies as heroin alley, something like that, the drug alley. So it's not... building new housing there will not solve this problem of crime. Actually it would have been made worse because to communicate between the two part of Harlem, east Harlem and west Harlem, you would have to go under this vault which was even much larger, wider. So will have a little tunnel and tunnels are not very good in an area where are full of crime and drug addicts.

Anthony: So I think Alain, I think by this time Robert Moses was already stepping out of city hall.

Alain: Yes. He was never in city hall, he was never elected. But he was a very powerful, I think the word of [Robert Pierot 00:24:04], the power broker, that's exactly what he was without being elected because he had so many connections with the building industry, the highway industry and politicians. Well, everything he did was not negative, the police had, for instance, so Jones Beach, thing like that were valid things. Except that the highway to go to Jones Beach had very low beaches to prevent buses from using it because he didn't want the rabble of the city to mess up the beaches.

Anthony: So back then you mentioned you were at city hall and some of these projects were still, let's say, we could see them today as a little bit absurd. You mentioned that you when you were at Chandigarh you already had a, let's say, first awakening?

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: So what were your thoughts at the time? How were your views on urban planning evolving and how did you see the way that they were planning Manhattan at the time?

Alain: It was a bit of a continuation from Chandigarh, in a way. When I first worked on this project in Harlem, building this vault and using the air rights to build... there was still in my background as architect, and architects like to build things and especially new things which look different. So first I thought hey, this is great. This is a big project, I can... and again when you live in Harlem and you realize that going, for instance, under the existing railway which crossed Harlem was a dangerous place and people urinated there. You say, my project is going to triple the width of this tunnel. Then you realize, gee, I would not like to cross this. You have to take the subway on Lexington. So I will have to go from my office and go in there. Then suddenly you realize that what looks, as an architects, what looks like a great thing which will make it into a magazine is a terrible thing when you are on the ground. That was a continuity.

Alain: So I started doing things, especially when I was still downtown during my lunch break, I will go to certain place in the Wall Street area and I will try to count how people who were on foot move around the city. When you get out of the subway and you have to go to your office you have an alternative of several routes. Why would you take one route rather than another? So I started following people and noting on a map what they were doing, and I noted that sometime they didn't take the shorter route and they went into the most attractive route. Let's say more diverse where there were more shops, even if they didn't use the shop. So for me this pedestrian view of urban was very important, and I could see that this was something which normally completely neglected by planners. This street view of... for instance say, Philip Johnson built a library for NYU at Greenwich Village and Greenwich Village is interesting because they have so many shops and restaurants and the library, it's a blank wall, very beautiful red limestone. But suddenly it becomes boring.

Alain: So I'm not saying that in the library you should have an opening for a coffee shop or something, maybe you should. The contact between the private space of a block and the street should be as transparent as possible. It should not be a fortress. So I think that's what's interesting and in a way, you mentioned yeah I was critical of some of what my colleagues were doing. And including, by the way, Marie-Agnes, at the time where working also at city hall, but she was working on giving incentives to make plaza like the Seagram Building, I talk about it in my book. Indeed the plaza of the Seagram Building is a success, urban design success, it's wonderful. But you cannot regulate good design, as soon as you regulate it you kill the design.

Alain: So for instance on 6th Avenue, the idea that all the new skyscrapers there will be like the Seagram building with a plaza, so if all the buildings have a plaza there is no plaza, it's just a wider avenue. Then the lawyer take over because the plaza will be private space, that means that if anybody breaks his leg there or do anything the building is responsible for it, not the city, so they can be sued. So the lawyer convinced the architect to make this plaza as hostile as possible so there will be the least people possible, you see? But there is a logic to it, it's not just a conspiracy or bad will, there is a logic to it. And you have to understand this logic, why things do not succeed just through regulation.

Anthony: Perfect, yeah the example of the plaza is excellent. So fast forward maybe 10, 15 years. Jane Jacob's books have come out, her work around some emergent order in cities is maybe one of the first to be written in that kind of writing. And to me it resonates a lot with the work that you have published recently, in a different way. Did her work influence you at the time? And how did you see it?

Alain: Yes, relatively little. After New York we went to Yemen where we spent three years. So in Yemen Jane Jacob's books were not accessible although they were published at the time we were there, but we had no access to them. So Yemen, you know in a way what Jane Jacobs talk about, I had observed those things. Again in Chandigarh were more alive, more diversity than the planned city and things like that. But i didn't have a theory behind it, in a way it was a little anecdotal. In Yemen I observed also the density, I mean at the time the Yemeni were completely unplanned in the sense that people were just aggregating things. My main job in Yemen was really to trace new streets because the city was growing so fast and there was no system really, so I was trying... and so I observed a lot of things, like for instance, density decreased when you go away from the city. For me those were just personal observations, idiosyncrasies of cities. And it's only when I went to Haiti and I worked with an urban economist I realized that all these things that I had observed were in fact, urban economists, they have also observed them but measured them and made a theory of them.

Alain: So it confirmed, it gave a theoretical background to things that I had observed and thought positive. And it was the same thing for Jane Jacobs, in particular her book, The Economy of Cities, I think it's in this book where she talk also about the Turkish city built around obsidian, it had become an obsidian center, so the jobs accumulate. Then when obsidian is not more needed then the city disappear. So again that confirmed my view of the labor market, a city based on the labor market. So if you don't diversify, you start with obsidian but if you do not diversify and the city's not particularly that well located except for obsidian, then the city will disappear. I think that that so... so it was, if you want, I acquired slowly I will say, I won't call it academic knowledge, but say theoretical knowledge by other people while observing very carefully what was going on on the ground. Then I found a convergence with it, you know?

Alain: And a complete divergence, of course, with the idea of international style or even ideas like, at the time the big planners, there was a Greek firm called Doxiadis who built Islamabad, who built a lot of cities. I don't know if they did anything in Latin America, I forgot, probably they did.

Anthony: There were a few plans in Brazil.

Alain: In Brazil, yeah.

Anthony: I believe in Rio De Janeiro.

Alain: oh yeah, of Doxiadis. And those were completely... these were really Corbusier type of thing, in a certain way. A complete rationality, built on formula without much observation of how people live in a city. The idea that you have a shopping street in the middle of a neighborhood because it's closest to all part. Like every neighborhood was completely isolated. A city is a continuity, a street is a continuity. So in a way Christoper Alexander I think have a better understanding in theoretical things than Doxiadis or again the continuation of this thing, the unit, the planned unit completely independent and self-sufficient. And the sector of Chandigarh were like that, there were the sectors which were 800 meter, if I remember well, by a kilometer or something like that. And all the commerce were in a little plaza and a few streets in the middle of the thing. Where in fact commerce thrived where people were moving. So it's good to be in the center like that for a primary school, but not good for commerce.

Anthony: And Alain, look at this, let's say timeline, of urban utopias and ideas, right, I see a change in mindset, maybe beginning with garden cities or modernism where urban planners started to try to, let's say, organize city form, right?

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: And since then, maybe Jane Jacobs is the first one to give a different perspective on the problem?

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: But still after she published her works many planners tried to use the qualities and ideas she describes in her observations as a sort of design manual, right?

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: So trying to regulate mixed income in the same buildings or the age of buildings, right, to give the qualities that Jacobs has described by observation and of a spontaneous outcome, right?

Alain: Yes. Yeah this is the sad thing about it. Again it's the same story as the Seagram Building. The Seagram Building was a good design because it was unique there, and suddenly as soon as you start making it a general rule, then it destroys itself. What is important in Jane Jacobs is spontaneity, at the same time she didn't speak about spontaneous order like that exactly but something like that. She speaks about randomness, you know? And this is what's so difficult to accept for planners, randomness. That in a way we get back maybe to the idea of Hayek or even Adam Smith, individual initiative. People have knowledge, again, how to run a bakery, or a butcher in the case of Adam Smith. That planners don't know where to put, you know, how many butcher shop there should be and where there should be. So to make into a rule that, suddenly you observe that in Paris that you have say, a butcher for every 10,000 people and you say, aha, we are going to plan a city where you have a butcher, I say butcher but it could be anything else of course, a shopping center or something.

Alain: Then you get it wrong because precisely this thing is involving, depending on the way demand evolves. People maybe at a certain time will eat less meat or get their meat from somewhere else than the butcher. So the city should be allowed to evolve on that, I think that's an important contribution of Jane Jacobs', precisely this... so you should have a structure, after all the streets of Greenwich Village, if that was a model, were already there and they never change and she didn't want the street to change. But on these streets you build things differently depending on the way people evolve and technology evolve. And I think that's a message which is the most important, you know?

Alain: So you have a spontaneous order that is made of individuals who are pursuing their own interests, let's say again in Adam Smith's theory, and who have special knowledge of their field like Hayek postulates. Then you have still, you absolutely need a structure which is top down, like Haussmann, on which you branch that. Then the important thing is that the communication between the private and the public, which often is very neglected. I reproach very much urban planners now to spend too much time trying to design what is happening in the private sector and not enough in the area where they are responsible for it and not enough in the designing the public space and especially the relationship between the public and the private space. For instance the opening of shops or if you have a garage how it should open so that you have a still maximum of life on the street and things like that.

Alain: There are some progress, I see now some progress in the design of sidewalk in New York in some area, so that's very good, especially when you have a pedestrian crossing thing like that, I think they have improved it. But I think this is new, this should have been, I think, the main concern of urban planners. I get back also to the question of BRT, I think that BRT suffer from a lack of good urban design, to link the station of BRT with the rest of the city and the way the city communicates across the BRT line, which are just urban design problems. I think this has been grossly neglected, but if you look at the New York zoning plan they go into minute details about the height of building, how far they should be from each other, the size of kitchen, the way the bathroom should be connected, I mean... I'm not talking here by the way about safety regulation, you know fire or sanitation. This I leave it to the customer, you don't know, you have to rely on the firemen to know what is a fire-proof building.

Alain: But anything which is space-use, how much floor space you consume and how it is organized I think the consumer is the best judge to do that. And the shop-keeper too, in New York for instance, in many shop there is a minimum and maximum floor space for some reason. I don't know where it comes from, magic numbers that are coming from a...

Anthony: Yes, exactly. So we've seen, since then, since Jacobs' we've seen a sort of explosion of new utopias, right? From new urbanism and even transit oriented development has a final view on the shape of how the city should look like, right?

Alain: Yes.

Anthony: And my question is, I mean we've seen this since... I mean the garden city, it's like 120 years already right? And when Jane Jacobs came along with these new ideas but her ideas got lost somehow in the middle of the process and we're still not, let's say, in the path of going back to, let's say classical urban planning and I would like to know your views on why this happens. Sometimes I think, is it the fact that we learn urban planning and architecture as the same thing? Is it something else? Why do you think these ideas have endured for so long?

Alain: Yes I think it is very, very difficult for architects and engineers and basically cities are built by engineers and architects and lawyers. It's very difficult for them to admit that there's spontaneous order, that there are certain things that they may not know and they should leave the maximum flexibility of land use because they want to optimize everything. It's easier, for instance if you want to optimize transport, I remember a case in Indonesia where the Japanese were planning a light rail through Jakarta and they have very competent, of course, traffic engineers. They calculated that to make this light rail viable they needed a density along the light rail of say, I forgot now, but say 250 people per hectare on the corridor of say one kilometer of both side of the light rail.

Alain: So there idea was not to maximize mobility in Jakarta, it was to maximize the financial viability of their infrastructure. Now I am not saying that a light rail was not a good idea in Jakarta, but then the objective is a little different. So if the objective is to make the light rail work, not to make it optimum for moving around the city but to make it work, then of course they need to have this higher density there because there was no demand for this high density yet there, to say the area which are not around the light rail should have a mandatory low density in order to... which is a bit, by the way, the plan of Curitiba, in a way it's the same. So you try to maximize the efficiency of infrastructure, you decide on the infrastructure first, then you say the people around this infrastructure should be grouped that way so that my infrastructure will be very efficient.

Alain: This is not the right way to do things. In a way, although a transport system is public sector, but it's the same thing as when General Motors say, what's good for General Motor is good for the country, it's not necessarily true. So what's good for the light rail, the type of land use which is good for the light rail is not necessarily good for Jakarta. So at the same time in Jakarta, another example like that, and I think it answers very well your question, why we had the problem. The World Bank, by the way. We had very competent sewer engineers and drainage engineer and they look at Jakarta and the soil condition and they say, you know in a tropical country like that we do not need... we could get away without having a traditional sewer system, we could have oxidation ponds which are local and a seepage pit. But in order to do that the density would need to be less than 50 people per hectare. So they say the planners should plan a city of less than 50 people per hectare, then we will save a lot on the sewer. You put it in reverse here. Of course you should have a sewer which is the least expensive possible, but to serve the people where they are, not to design a city around a sewer system.

Anthony: No, that's a great example. The example you mentioned with the light rail in Indonesia, I would say it's basically the dominant idea in Brazil today. So the latest Sau Paulo master plan is based on this idea. So they allowed higher density but not that much, [FAR 00:45:12] of four-

Alain: Yes, that's...

Anthony: ... around the main rail and BRT lines. But said okay, outside these areas we will want lower density and within the high density lines we will incentivize smaller units so we will have more people occupying these buildings and we will restrict the amount of parking, so people will also not use the car, they will use the rail or the bus system.

Alain: Yeah, you know again strangely enough, you see at the end of my short article there on the 15 minute city, I have a quotation of Tocqueville which in a way, when you look at the regulation you describe in Sau Paolo, it's people where they're really concerned about making things work. Then they establish rules so that the thing they designed will work without really considering why people in San Paulo some of them will have to use cars. Maybe a doctor, maybe a plumber obviously has to use a car. They say, well it would work so well if everybody walked, you know? And I think that then they put rules which seems not too tyrannical in a certain way, to say, well we are going to reduce parking, mandate... you know again I think parking should not be compulsory. It's a part of real estate and it should be operated privately because in many cities, subsidized parking. And in a way, if you, like in many cities of the world, you say for a shop of this you need that many parking lot. You are subsidizing it because you are obliging people to afford that. So I think it should be a part of real estate, in the same way as you should not decide how many bakery you have in a city, you should not decide how many parking space.

Alain: But it should be market driven, that means it should not be subsidized, if there are people, then... then you should certainly be very careful about the urban design aspect, all this private parking lot where they will probably be underground, communicate with the city so they don't clog the city or be dangerous for pedestrians or anything like that. So that's an aspect that should be regulated, the urban design and the link between the two. But again to me the urban design is mostly in the public area which are not driven by markets, which are not driven by people preferences. You can observe the number of pedestrian in the street and say, well we need wider sidewalks. But the market is not going to give you wider sidewalks, there is no mechanism for that, even if there is a high demand. So here it has to be top down in a certain way. A lot of attention should be given to that, but much less to the size of apartment or things like that, which I think the people can decide by themselves. Certainly there should not be regulation to say what is the number of apartment of this size, of this size.

Alain: In New York we have in fact the opposite, we have, for each block, we have the maximum number of apartments which can be built in each block which is based on a number which was invented in 1962 based on densities at the time where the average household size was around five people. Now it's 1.3 I think in Manhattan or something like that. So it's a completely arbitrary number just coming out of nowhere, like if it was coming from the sign of the Zodiac or something.

Anthony: It's amazing, we still have a long way to go and I think your work is a huge inspiration for us. So Alain, I think your comment on the 15 minute city gives us a good hint for us to move onto questions of some of our supporters. So [Ivandrew 00:49:20], he sent a question through message. He asks if the argument for the 15 minute city couldn't work in fact as a marketing strategy, so maybe not for Paris where that city has already optimized for 15 minutes where it can, as you argued in your article. But maybe in Brazil or United States, Parisian suburbs that have not reached this level of accessibility or mixed use. So his question is maybe this concept would be a good way to summarize a goal for citizens who are not trained as urban planners.

Alain: Yeah I mean it's wonderful to have even a 10 minute city, my problem is not the goal, my problem is the way you achieve it. I think that you achieve, let's say the 10 minute city or the 15 minute city for things like food, schools or things like that. By removing regulation which prevent demand from being met. Do not forget that the 15 minute city depends on densities. If you look at all the plans around the world for zoning, the zoning prevents densities. You never have a zoning which... all the zoning limit densities. Either by floor ratio, by a minimum-maximum number of dwelling unit per hectare, by setbacks, by all sorts of things. So if you want to increase accessibility you have this trade off that you have to have low density to meet demand. There is demand for low density too, there are people who enjoy having a backyard and squirrels in their backyard. So those people are making a trade off and they know if they live in an individual house and they prefer it, they know that their bakery or their grocery store will be at 20 minutes, you know well they can use a bicycle for it if they want.

Alain: But that's linked together, you cannot have a 15 minute city without dealing with supply and demand. So my problem with the planners is that it seems to say, well we are going to plan it that way. You don't plan it that way. And the same for schools, you know I was a... when I read the 15 minute city of Moreno there, I didn't know how schools were built in Paris, frankly. So I checked in it and it was very interesting. It seems that they are very competent civil servants because the schools are state run. By the way, not a municipality but the ministry of education. We are a centralized... you know, Louis XIV's country, we are very centralized. Those civil servants are very, very responsive, and you find more schools in denser neighborhoods of Paris and less school in neighborhood where people are aging. You know? There are much less children. They are very responsive and they close them and they open them depending on the change.

Alain: So I was happily surprised here, they had some good... in a way they were doing good planning. So the 15 minute city. Now if you say, for instance, you should have, especially in the dense city, access to public transport within 15 minutes walk or I would say even 10 minutes walk, I completely agree with that but then you should have a program of that. This is not what Moreno is all about, Moreno's say we have a way, we're designing the city so you will find your job within 15 minutes. I believe that if you move to Sau Paolo or to Paris or to Shanghai it is not to take a job within 15 minutes. You select the best job in the entire metropolitan area for Sau Paolo and the employer is also looking for selecting the best person in the entire metropolitan. So this trade off has to be understood. A job is not an indifferent job, it's not one job. You have a choice and you should have a choice of many, many jobs.

Anthony: Perfect, thank you, thank you Alain. So Maria asks a question about urban transformation in urban fringes. So when rural areas are subdivided into lots or maybe vacation homes are transformed into residential areas, excessively and intensively occupying areas that were once low density. I believe you mentioned some of this in your book about the value of land but maybe you can comment about this to answer her question.

Alain: Yeah I think that again here you have, let's say I simplify. We have two cases. Either the state will not intervene at all and you have spontaneous development but including spontaneous development of streets and major streets. When it's a small access street to a lot it doesn't matter. But let's say if you have new suburbs created in the fringe of a city, one of the most important things is that this new suburb has to be linked to the rest of the city because again, the people who are moving in this area are part of the labor market and they are going to have to work somewhere and not necessarily in their neighborhood, probably not in their neighborhood. So the state here has to intervene and it's a top down thing. To integrate this new neighborhood with a network of transport which links with the entire area of the city. This idea that the city could grow within a self-contained area, you know sometimes you have that in, for instance I've seen that in Korea where they build new cities and they think those new cities next to Seoul are going to be self contained, that people who live there will work there.

Alain: It's not true. It's never happened that way. So you have to link, the state has to establish a link with the rest of the city. Now, that's done, the way that land is subdivided should be, again, entirely demand driven. Once you have ensured that you have set apart the space which will be not under the market which will be devoted to main streets the rest should be demand driven. The problem we have, either we have complete failure of the state who do not develop the infrastructure to link those neighborhoods to the rest of the city, then also you have what you call haphazard development. Which I don't believe, there is nothing really haphazard. You have all sort of building and in a way they respond better to demand because there is no regulation. But then they lack transport. So in the long run that will not be very good for the city. Or you have then the way many American cities or Europeans expand, you have an imposition in advance of one pattern, one type of density which is arbitrary. You don't know what will be the demand for, say, three story walk-up apartment compared to individual houses or townhouses. I think that you should have a type of regulation which should allow the consumer to make a choice to live in a suburb but live in a townhouse, rather than an individual.

Alain: Or, on the contrary to live on a lot of a quarter of an hectare and let's see what happens. I don't see why the state should decide on the consumption of land in any area of the city. Engineers would tell you, ah, but the infrastructure is not there. The job of the state is to provide the infrastructure to support where the people are, not the opposite.

Anthony: With this idea in mind do you think there is a tension between the necessity of the state to provide infrastructure to all areas? And the fact that an individual decision to move into the outskirts of an urban area will, let's say, create a public necessity right? At a higher cost.

Alain: I mean let's say, why will somebody go... the state could say, this is our plan for infrastructure in the future and we are going to expand. You will not get a road here before 10 years, that's possible. But if somebody, let's say, densify an area which is relatively far away from the border of the urban area. Again, you have to ask why would they do that? In a way it would be better for them to be closer, that will give more value. So why do they do that? Sometimes they do that because precisely, I've seen that a lot in India by the way, precisely their regulation at the fringe which oblige them to use more land than they wanted. Then they have to jump over... or sometimes you have a green belt, so on the side of the greenbelt the land is too expensive because they know it's a green belt, it's the last land left...

Alain: So you have to find why the people do that. The idea that people are vicious and are building things in impossible places just to annoy planners is not true. Again very often, sometimes in The World Bank report you see haphazard development. Development which is not under control. I argue with that, any development which happens has it's reason and you have to find why it is there. It is to find cheaper land, why is land so expensive somewhere else? And maybe there are people who are poorer and they settle there precisely because they cannot afford land. So by preventing them from building them you don't make them richer. So how do those people want to participate in the labor market of the city, where do they settle?

Alain: In my book I gave the example, if I remember well, in Mexico City of an informal development on the slope of a volcano which probably should not be built, I agree. But you have to find out why will people build their informal settlement, accessible by motorcycle to the labor market of Mexico City. Why would they build there? If you prevent them from building there and you may have a good reason to do it, I'm not denying it. But then you have to provide an alternative thing so your reflex should not be to prevent things which you find disturbing, but to say why do people move there? Can we provide an alternative at the same price? So you have to monitor the price of this informal settlement and say, if they move closer to the city they have to consume much more land. Then you should have, closer to the city, the possibility of consuming very little land for these people.

Alain: So you have to look at the problem that way. The same way as when people want to close completely the city to cars you have to look, why somebody drives from Manhattan? It's not fun to drive through Manhattan, so why would they drive through Manhattan? And you have to find an alternative, could some of them be provided with an alternative to that? So again the idea that a city is made of people and you have to find out what is best for them rather than design the infrastructure and say the people have to adapt to my infrastructure because really this will be optimum if they do. Sorry, it was a long answer.

Anthony: No, no problem. Do you have time for a couple more?

Alain: Yes I have plenty of time, yes.

Anthony: Great. So we have two questions around this concept of infrastructure and informal housing. One of them is how to address urban areas that have been consolidated with, let's say, favelas and the urban expansion was unplanned. What is the best benchmarks to bring infrastructure to these areas? And another question by [Chris Journey 01:01:43] is, what about areas that maybe are environmentally sensitive areas? We have in Brazil for example houses above lakes or rivers. Do we bring infrastructure to these communities or are these cases where a relocation would be justified?

Alain: Yes. So the first question, it's possible... so area which are already densified, let's say favelas and surrounding area. I think that one of the main problems here is, again, to link those areas with the rest of the city in terms of first providing basic infrastructure. I don't think, by the way, especially in a tropical country or a warm country that housing is as important as infrastructure. So the best thing you can do, in my opinion in a favella, is to bring infrastructure, you know clean water and also the possibility of moving through the favela relatively fast and to access public transport. It might not be possible within the favela to provide it, but say at the fringe of the favela. I think that's the most important thing. So it is possible that in some areas you may have to do a Haussmann operation. In order to link, again, this large area... I can think of that in some area of Mexico City where you have large areas, very dense population and most of the streets are about six to eight meters, no more than six meters. Those people are penalized by lack of access of the large labor market of Mexico City.

Alain: So you may have to have a Haussmann operation here and again, you will have to do it not by cutting a street but probably also relocating people on site by doing a real estate operation at the same time, you know? Not concentrate on the street so that people are relocated on site and that will be part of the cost of the street in a way but you will create wealth at the same time. You create fixed capital. So it's a bit complicated, I'd rather discuss that maybe on a drawing or on a map but that I think... the linkage of a poor area with the rest of the labor market by fast transport is very, very important. Very poor people who cannot afford transport very often are very limited to taking jobs relatively close to where they live, then their salaries are much lower because of that and they have much less also possibility. You know you learn a lot on the job and they have less possibility of learning on the job. So I think that easy access to the rest of the labor market is very important.

Alain: The other question, environmentally sensitive areas. Now there are two possibilities. Either it's area which will always be flood or are necessarily because of... so again if people settle there, certainly it's not because they enjoy spoiling the environment there, it's because it's the only cheap land. So can you provide somewhere, land which is as cheap and is as well located, the question is that. If you don't you expel the people from this area but you have not solved any problem. The area looks better without the slum on it and maybe even ducks will be there or something, it will be very nice. But what about those people? Those people will be worse off. So you have absolutely to find an alternative solution. Don't forget that if they go there it's not because they are ignorant or anything it's because they look around their entire city and they find this. Although maybe they are flooded all the time, maybe they are full of mosquitoes and things like that, not very comfortable.

Alain: But they found that from their point of view this is the best place in the city, so can you find for people like that with this income something which is equivalent and which is not in a sensitive area? So that's the thing. Now, in some area, I remember a case in India where there was a large slum on an area which was regularly flooded and again, the people knew it was flooded. But because it was flooded the land was cheap and that's why they settled there. It was relatively close, they have a good access to the city center through this area. So the city first decided to remove them and put them somewhere far away from the city, where in fact they were relatively close. Then we found if you have a good engineer, we found that by building a [bunt 01:06:29] around this area in fact it will be much cheaper to prevent this area from flooding without relocating people and bringing clean water and a system to remove garbage from this area and things like that.

Alain: So that was also done quite a number of times in Indonesia in the Kampung project that I speak about. So again here you should see if some civil work will not solve the problem of flooding, for instance. If the area is not otherwise sensitive. But some area should stay wet, you know? If they're a wetland or things like that, I have no problem with that obviously. Or say, the slope of the volcano around Mexico City probably should not be built because of the difficulty, the drainage problem that it causes and things like that. So here you have to... but always think. You know the problem sometimes when you address this is to beautify the area and kick the people out and these people are not going to disappear, they are not going to go back to their village, they are going to go somewhere else in the city and create another problem so unless you address the problem of the people, in particular affordability. Land affordability and access to jobs, you are not going to solve the problem.

Flash floods in Jakarta's kampungs
Anthony: Amazing, amazing answer, thank you Alain. I think we have a couple of last other questions. Andrea says that there is a 2004 paper in which you explain that the city of Bangalore restricted FAR in central areas because they believed it would be too costly to build infrastructure large enough to accommodate a large population. Of course this caused the population to spread outwards which increased the demand for infrastructure. Do you know of any cities where this density restriction, because of financial concerns, would make sense? And he believes that many people in Brazil argue against density saying that the cost of improving infrastructure would be too high.

Alain: Look, it's very simple. Look at the cost of land and look at the cost of infrastructure and very often to save, say $10 million in infrastructure, you blow up $100 million of real estate. So there could be a situation where infrastructure in some area is so expensive because, I don't know, mud maybe or earthquake or something. But my experience is always that infrastructure is, when there is demand by the way. The problem is that sometimes planners build infrastructure in the middle of nowhere where there is no demand, then the infrastructure becomes, indeed, very expensive because there is no demand for it. But if you are in a downtown area or say suburban area where there is a lot of demand for housing or whatever, office building, my experience is that it's always cheaper to bring pipes there or to increase the sewer system and things like that. Look at cities like Manhattan or Paris, they had no infrastructure, the infrastructure was built little by little. If Manhattan had decided gee, in the 19th century they had no sewer by the way, so we don't want to spend on infrastructure, the city should expand or you should move to Baltimore or something like that, it doesn't make sense.

Alain: You have to adapt. The problem of course is very often you do not have mechanisms to recover the cost of infrastructure so you have a municipal budget for sewers and you have no mechanism to get it back and it's possible if you increase density you have something like an impact fee or something which will pay for that additional infrastructure. Or you have the system that you have in Texas where you have bonds which are repaid by property tax in the long run. But there you need a relatively sophisticated financial system of course to do that. So I think that it's not that infrastructure is too costly when there is demand for area, it's just that you have no mechanism to recover the cost of infrastructure. You know, it comes from one pocket where the money's going in another pocket, so you don't do it. I cannot imagine a case where there is a high demand for infrastructure where the price of the real estate will not largely compensate the cost of infrastructure.

Anthony: Alain, your answer was on point as I think our last question was exactly on this topic. So Arthur asks about Latin American cities with budget constraints and how could infrastructure be provided. You gave us some light on it already. What do you think about selling building rights, other finance mechanisms cities could use.

Alain: Yes, let's say... the problem of course when it's the government who sell it, all to establish a price which would kill the market, because you could price it in such a way that it doesn't kill the market, then nothing happens. I think that now if we talk about Brazil there is a financial system in Brazil which is deep enough to be able to finance cities. Cities I'm sure are able to issue bonds, for most cities, and probably this is the best way to finance. This means that you have a property tax or some income which will guarantee the bonds of course, on which the bonds will be placed. So I'm not really an expert on municipal finance, frankly, but it is true that the financing of infrastructure is a very important thing and very often cities are broke. When in fact you look at the price of real estate in the city you don't have the feeling that people are broke, after all if they pay this amount for real estate there is money circulating there and there is no doubt they should pay for infrastructure.

Alain: I think that one example, again I'm not an expert on that, but one example that I find very convincing is what is used in Texas. I think it's called MUD, municipal urban district, and it's a way of issuing bonds which do not necessarily cover a specific... it can go over even several municipalities. But the bond covers the infrastructure. So when you are in a suburban area you have a district, the district is specific to the infrastructure which may go across several suburban boundaries. And this seems to work very well and that explains in large part why housing in general in Texas is much cheaper than in other parts of the United States. Because of those bonds you are able to develop enough infrastructure to... and by the way, they also, in the city of Houston, they revise periodically also now the land use so that they increase sometimes density if they feel there is a demand for smaller apartments or smaller plots, they are able to do that.

Anthony: One of our supporters Eric just messaged us saying that municipalities are restricted from issuing bonds in Brazil.

Alain: Oh really? Ah yes.

Anthony: Unfortunately.

Alain: Because the state do not think that they are able to repay them, right?

Anthony: Maybe, maybe.

Alain: So maybe there are other mechanisms than bonds but I think that when cities are able to issue bonds and they know that they will not be bailed out by the state, I think that might be the best, look maybe I'm biased, again I'm not an expert on municipal finance.

Anthony: There is an instrument in Brazil which I find interesting that cities can specify an urban area and they sell building rights and with the proceeds they will invest in that urban area and the price is not set nominally by city hall, it's an auction and these building rights titles are sold in the open market, so that's an interesting way to avoid the price definition.

Alain: Right, yeah, that's interesting. And I suppose that in those areas then they establish also standards of urbanization, right? Because the building rights are based on the private parts of the development, obviously.

Anthony: Yes, yes.

Alain: Yes it's a bit like what Hong Kong used to do, I'm not so sure now in the last three years, if they skipped doing it. But that's Hong Kong used to do in the past to develop and that's why you had suburbs in Hong Kong with very high densities because that's what people were ready to pay to get as close as possible to the center of Hong Kong and to public transport. Because with the density of Hong Kong, Hong Kong can function only for about 80% of people who use public transport. Let's say about 500, 600 people per hectare. So yes, that's a solution. I had a case, strangely enough in Iran, I work in Iran after the revolution, and there was a mayor of Tehran who was desperate for money and to respond, again, to density. He did exactly that, he auctioned the rights to build and he financed infrastructure like that and the central government was critical of it but I look at the outcome of it when I was there and I felt it was... it's a little primitive, let's say, but it works in producing an enormous amount of floor space which was obviously affordable because it was all private.

Hong Kong
Alain: People are always asking for a compact city. It created a compact city by itself without having to regulate it or things like that. And the fact that it was auctioned, if it was set by the government you will always expect  that there would be an area where there is no demand and they put a very high price but here it was obviously demand driven. So again, being demand driven is very important.

Anthony: I'm personally surprised about these mechanisms because with all of the density restrictions most big cities are sitting on a pile of cash, right?

Alain: Yes, yes, exactly.

Anthony: They could easily finance themselves in many different ways.

Alain: A guy like Trump, the way he made some of the money was to buy land in Manhattan which was zoned for industry or something like that. The steel industry land in Manhattan and they thought you will be crazy to create an industry in Manhattan. So this land has very little value, it's used usually for storage. And if you know how to change, so you buy it, if you know how to change it so it has a potential value of hundreds of millions of dollars but you buy it for $50 million. You wait, it takes maybe 10 years with very expensive lawyers to change the zoning if you know... I'm not implying corruption even, just a process you know? The board president, the community, whatever. After 10 years suddenly it becomes commercial or residential and you have made a bundle. But it all goes to the developer and the lawyers because you have to have very skilled lawyers to do that. But the city was sitting on it and not doing anything with it.

Anthony: Yeah, yeah. And the cities have a lot to learn with real estate developers.

Alain: Why do New York maintain manufacturing in Manhattan where there is no demand for manufacturing? Again, some people believe that manufacturing jobs could come back to Manhattan and that you will have... so the union, a number of people believe, well if we maintain them then we will have good jobs, manufacturing, instead of having only services. I mean it's a myth, it will not not happen. It just transfers money from the city to developers and lawyers. I apologize for the lawyers here. I have great respect for zoning lawyers.

Anthony: Well, that's fine, that's fine. Alain, we're passed the time we had scheduled, but it was a great pleasure to talk to you.

Alain: Same here, thank you.

Anthony: We're done with questions for now, but I don't want to take too much of your time. It's always an honor to connect with you and we have many big fans of your work here with us, so thank you.

 Strategically ignorant


                  Strategically ignorant
                  

April 1st, 2018
Effective software developers know how to manage their ignorance. Studying the inner workings of each dependency and every layer of your stack is a luxury you often can't afford, so it's important to know how and when to make leaps of faith.

More than any explicit technical knowledge, this intuition is perhaps the biggest thing that differentiates experienced programmers from inexperienced ones. When I first started coding, painful awareness that I didn't understand how every piece worked paralyzed me. I felt like I couldn't possibly move forward until I had a grasp of everything my task depended on. Now, I realize that's just part of the job.

Now of course you don’t want to idly accept that fate! It's worth diving in when you can in order to learn more of the layers at play. Curiosity is valuable and rewarded—the best developers are those who can't help but go down rabbit holes of technical arcana, the ones who love to reverse-engineering systems, the ones who are never satisfied with the depth of their knowledge. 

But you can't always do this. Sometimes, you just don't have the mental bandwidth, and sometimes deep knowledge of  the marginal tool or library works is not important to achieving the goal at hand. Technological complexity is a fractal, with each layer in the stack giving way to another infinite layer of interestingness. People build entire careers on distributed systems, chip designs, programming languages, core libraries... the list goes on and on. A key component of strategic ignorance is differentiating when diving in to learn something more deeply is productive towards your goals versus when it simply feels virtuous. (The hard part is that you have to decide what that means!)

When to apply this strategic ignorance is less a transferrable set of rules than an intuition. As far as I know, it can only be learned with time and learning from mistakes.
Each layer shown here is an entire career in and of itself. And many dozens of careers, if you zoom in to that layer. You just need to decide which level you want to focus on for now.After all, that's the real magic of software engineering: building abstractions on top of one another, starting from electrical signals, silicon, and transistors on to bits, registers, and machine code on to virtual memory, higher-level languages, and libraries. Understanding the systems underlying your code is valuable, but it's not a blocking prerequisite to being productive. Allowing yourself to be swallowed into the infinite cycle of "I need to learn more before I can start" certainly will block you, however.

Once you realize that the complexity of technology is scale-free—that every layer has as much nuance as one abstraction above it—you can accept that ignorance is normal, and you can move on and actually write the software you set out to build.

                  Travel photos are underrated
                  

June 9th, 2019
I snapped many photos while wandering Haifa last week, as I always do whenever I see something new or interesting while exploring a city. I was with my friend Tyler, who conspicuously does not take photos while exploring a new place. I asked him why, and his answer was, "It's a distraction, and I can find better images online."

The first half of his answer really resonated with me. I too find it distracting to document something in the midst of experiencing that thing. It disrupts the "flow" of a moment, and when you zero in on something, it narrows your field of vision and can cause you to miss other interesting details just outside of the frame.

The second part of his answer made sense, too. During that conversation, we were facing the famous Bahá’í Gardens. I'd snapped a photo just moments before, and he's right that the photos of the gardens I found online are far more spectacular than whatever I shot with my cell phone (despite what the Shot on iPhone ads may lead you to believe).

To pile on the anti-photo train just a bit more, I'd add that taking photos can be rude to the people you're with. Live-documenting a moment—whether in the form of incessant photography, live tweets, or even old-fashioned pen and paper notes—subtly signals "I care more about how my future self reflects on this moment (or, worse, what the internet thinks) than about the experience you and I are sharing right now." 1


Google Images has a sea of stunning photos of the Bahá’í Gardens (left). My photography (above) doesn't quite compare.In other words, I agree that photos can be distracting and unnecessary, not to mention borderline rude. So why do I take photos?

I love capturing the little moments of daily life that happen at street level as I'm wandering around a city, whether it's a new one an ocean away or my own neighborhood in San Francisco. These are very different from the photos of the Eiffel Tower that every visitor to Paris has somewhere in their phone camera, different from the ones you'll find on travel guides or city government websites. You can't easily find the pictures I want on Google Images. I've yet to find a consistent good source of photos capturing exactly what it is that I find interesting on a city street, the sort of thing that I want to include in my City Reviews exploring the effects of infrastructure, culture, geography, and history on the day-to-day life of people living in that place. The only alternative is to capture them myself.

Even if I don't use the photos directly, they also help reconstruct my memory palace later. I enjoy reflecting on the places I go and researching more deeply the observations I noticed there, but I often lose the pointers to those memories in my mind. The memories are there, but they're hard to retrieve without some trigger to resurface them. Flipping through my photo album can jog my memory and take me deeper down a rabbit hole. 2

Photos also capture only a small part of how it feels to be in a place and time, so it really matters to me that I know exactly the context of where a photo was shot for me to be able to appreciate the place-ness of that photograph. When I'm writing about an Urban Chasm I experienced in Barcelona or a Narrow Street for People in Saigon, I want to recall the fabric of the city around it to begin to understand how it fits into the city system as a whole. I don't want just any Parisian street corner; I want the specific Parisian street corner where I noticed all of the woven plastic cafe chairs facing in on the same little square, like an audience facing the stage of a ballet that's about to begin, and how it was a little oasis of calm despite a major boulevard one block away because of the geometry of the buildings and the crooked little streets.


I have my own interpretation on how the world looks and feels, as do you and everyone else. The details that jump out to me differ from what will jump out to my mom, which differ from what will jump out to an architect, which differ from what will jump out to an economist, and so on. Photos are a little window into how a person perceives the world. Selfishly, I want more little windows into the way other people think, and I enjoy opening my own for others to catch a glimpse, too.

It's true that taking photos comes at a cost. But I'm willing to pay that cost3 when it's a matter of capturing something that others might overlook.

Footnotes
1 Of course sometimes that is the right tradeoff, and it can even be a sign of respect in the case of something like scribbling down notes about some insight that your conversation partner.2 Google Maps Timeline is also useful for this purpose. It's invaluable for retracing my steps on a given day and reconstructing my memory of what I did. For example, here's my timeline map for the day in Haifa: 3 The conversation in Haifa did get me thinking. Most of my photos are of the individual perspective type, but whenever I end up with a famous landmark in front of me I'm in the habit of snapping the same predictable pictures as any other traveler. These photos do just diminish the experience of seeing the thing with no real upside, so in the future I will be more intentional to restrict myself to taking photos that I think i'll only get if I myself take them.#photography

October 29th, 2019
Back in 2015, I wrote a blog post called Dropbox: the First Dead Decacorn. At the time, it was the most widely shared take I’d ever written. I learned several things from writing this piece, and none of them had to do with Dropbox: I learned, for instance, that a great way to get people to click on your blog post is to make them mad. I also learned about a company called Social Capital, after my soon-to-be-colleague Ray reached out to me about what I’d written. I’m certainly thankful I wrote it.  
Today, Dropbox is not dead. I’m glad! I certainly never wanted the business to do poorly. I used it all the time back then, continue to have friends who work there, and generally would rather not cheer for companies to fail; that’s not a great look. But I think it’s fair to say that the take didn’t turn out to be egregiously wrong. (Dropbox had last raised at a $10 billion valuation the year before, and currently trade at an 8 billion dollar market cap. So over the last five years that’s a -4% annual return, compared to the S&P at around 10%. Not dead, but hardly what I think most people pictured the next 5 years to be like.) 
Relatedly, I do believe that the main idea in the blog post turned out to be correct. Dropbox was the ultimate file product. But it also hit right at Peak Files. Files aren’t the focus going forward. At the time, I wrote: 
"Files are discrete objects that exist in a physical place; the internet is pretty much the opposite of that. … Dropbox might be the pinnacle of file management, but Slack is the beginning of what comes next. I don’t think files are going to completely disappear; not anytime soon, anyway. They’ll certainly still exist as data structures, deep inside our servers and our phones, for a very long time – and yet most people will be indifferent to their existence." 

I got to thinking about all this the other week after hearing news that Yahoo Groups was shutting down, and wiping out two decades of content – sending online communities and archivists into a scramble to preserve their spaces and history before it all disappears. It’s a huge bummer, for sure; and also a reminder of a hidden price we pay for modern technology. Everything is amazing, but nothing is ours.  
Up until the mid 2000s or so, it felt like the collective goal of software and the internet was to create digital versions of all the stuff that worked well in real life – documents became Word, slides became Powerpoint, and mail became email. It’s also why files are called files, and why we got rid of them by dragging them into the trash can. Software was pretty skeuomorphic in design and in function. The file as an atomic unit for productivity made sense. It’s a solid, distinct object you could understand, and that was yours. You had to take care of it, name it properly, and save it in the right place, just like a paper file.  
But for the last ten years, we’ve been undoing all of that. The constraints of mobile, plus a new generation of users that’ve never really known life without the internet, meant the benefits of skeuomorphism were no longer worth the cost. Ditching it as a philosophy, both in design and in function, freed us to go out and reinvent everything as a service. Abstract everything away into databases, links and logic, and provide it as a consumer service with all the topology and complexity hidden out of sight.  
We love services. Services free us to be pure consumers, seeking exactly what we want for as little friction and overhead as possible. So long as everything works, trading ownership for access is an attractive deal: everything under the hood just gets magic-ed away, and provided for us as a service. No files, no updates, no maintenance; just access. 
This isn’t just a software thing, by the way. New technology generally reorganizes our consumption away from ownership and towards access. 100 years ago, music came from a piano, then it came from the record store, and now it comes from Spotify. 100 years ago, food came from a farm, then it came for a grocery store, and now it comes from DoorDash. There’s no denying that this is forward progress for the consumer. You would not want to go backwards. But there’s a cost. The more you can access, the less it’s yours. 
I joke sometimes that my generation’s version of "Sorry I’m late, the car broke down" is "Sorry I’m late, the car got lost." It makes me laugh because cars are obviously better than they used to be: they don’t break down like they used to, they’re safer, and best of all, you don’t even have to drive it anymore. You just push the Uber button and somebody comes and picks you up. But it’s also not funny, because we’ve all experienced the particularly modern frustration of seeing the Uber drive in the opposite direction, spin around 4 times, then cancel. Access feels like the real thing, until it’s taken away from you.  
Look, all technology breaks sometimes. I’m not saying that new is bad because it’s buggy; I promise you, the old stuff broke too. You probably do not want to go back. But there’s a difference between "the car broke down" and "the car got lost". One is a fragility of things: if you drive a car, you need to take responsibility for keeping it in good shape. It’s a scarcity problem. But the latter feels more like an abundance problem: it’s fragility of something, I just couldn’t put my finger on what. 
Right as I was thinking about all of this, I came across this fabulous post by Simon Pitt from a couple weeks ago that had the answer. 
Computer files are going extinct | Simon Pitt
The whole post is good, but one thing he wrote hit me as a perfect gem of an idea, not just about files and software systems but about technology in general:  
"The other day, I came across a website I’d written over two decades ago. I double-clicked the file, and it opened and ran perfectly. Then I tried to run a website I’d written 18 months ago and found I couldn’t run it without firing up a web server, and when I ran NPM install, one or two of those 65,000 files had issues that meant node failed to install them and the website didn’t run. When I did get it working, it needed a database. And then it relied on some third-party APIs and there was an issue with CORS because I hadn’t whitelisted localhost.
My website made of files carried on, chugging along. This isn’t me saying that things were better in the old days. I’m just saying thatyears ago websites were made of files; now they are made of dependencies."
The last line really hit a chord with me: that’s exactly it. Worlds of scarcity are made out of things. Worlds of abundance are made out of dependencies. That’s the software playbook: find a system made of costly, redundant objects; and rearrange it into a fast, frictionless system made of logical dependencies. The delta in performance is irresistible, and dependencies are a compelling building block: they seem like just a piece of logic, with no cost and no friction. But they absolutely have a cost: the cost is complexity, outsourced agency, and brittleness. The cost of ownership is up front and visible; the cost of access is back-dated and hidden. 
Files feel like a good bellwether for what’s happening. We’re in this funny in-between time right now where our phones are fully in the future: apps are services kind of by definition, and it’s really hard to access the file system. But our computers are still kind of in the past: to me, at least, the two most important navigational anchors on my computer are the desktop and the downloads folder.  
One of the funny outcomes of this half-mobile half-desktop world is where our de facto file system remerged. In absence of a coherent, logical file system across these two worlds, we trampled down a desire path and made our own: our email inboxes. I (and many of you, I’m sure) use my email inbox the way we’re all supposed to use Dropbox: it’s a ubiquitous, universally understood way to move stuff around, store and retrieve it. Gmail is the new Finder.  
Email as a file system is inefficient, terribly designed, and full of friction. Repeatedly emailing yourself copy-and pasted information and attachments called presentation_final, presentation_final2 and presentation_final_final is nobody’s idea of a good time. But you know why it works? Dependency minimization. It’s air gapped from the rest of your work: no software update or edge case is going to screw things up so badly that it goes into your inbox and deletes your emails. You can always get to your email, and that attachment will always be there. It’s a universally adopted format. Most importantly, your inbox is yours. 
I think there’s a really strong, counter-trend bet to be made here over the next few tech generations. If the world is going to get reorganized into services and dependencies, so be it; but find what’s air gapped, and find what’s ours. People are smart enough to tell what’s solid and what isn’t. Product teams who go out of their way to give us real, tangible objects we feel that we can own will find a great deal of success.  
One example of a software company doing the right thing today is Figma. They’ve built an incredible user experience for multiplayer design software – a domain that’s been fully SaaSed – by taking out the excessive, "everything must be live access" type of dependencies in favour of simpler, stabler architecture that works fabulously and feels solid, like something you can trust. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ecosystem is having a real effect on how people think about ownership versus access, as people learn about how to store and manage their private keys, and by extension, come to realize everything that access isn’t.  
I’m fully confident that we’ll continue to invent great software that reimagines how the world can work. But I’d love to see more teams embrace the idea that less friction isn’t always best. If the current trend of technology is sweeping us in a direction of "everything is amazing, but nothing is ours", Technology that’s Actually Yours could be the next great counter-trend. #technology

 America's hidden urban laboratory: the South


                  America's hidden urban laboratory: the South
                  

June 14th, 2023
America hasn't built many walkable places in the last few decades, but there are a few exceptions. While collecting a list of these special places, I was shocked to discover that most are in the Southeast. 

My mental image of contemporary southern development did not include an appreciation of urbanism, walkability, and public spaces. On the contrary, it conjured images of massive highways and repetitive suburban sprawl. 

There certainly is a lot of that type of development too, and yet almost all of the best new urban fabric in the last few decades has happened south of the Mason-Dixon line.
A map of New Urbanist villages that I've been collecting. Notice the clusters in South Carolina, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle.This clustering in the South makes more sense now that I've studied the question of why the US doesn't build more walkable neighborhoods and towns. The first, obvious answer is that the South generally has less land use regulation than the Northeast and the West Coast, giving real estate developers more latitude in how they build. 

A prime example is Seaside, the 80-acre village in Florida that kicked off the New Urbanism movement in the early 1980s. The stretch of the Florida Panhandle where Seaside sits was such a backwater that the county didn't even have a Planning Department when Seaside was first getting built! As a result, the creators of Seaside had an incredible amount of freedom to build to their vision.


Seaside, FL was built in the 1980s but feels like a classic small town built before the car. One of my favorite details in Seaside is the secret walking paths winding through each cluster of homes.
But as I've learned more, I don't think this concentration of new walkable places in the Southeast is just about more open-minded regulation. Notably, even though Texas bars counties from imposing zoning codes, Texas doesn't have many of these places (at least that I know of). And yet the development that has been sprouting up all around Texas is rarely mixed-use, even though there is nothing standing in developers' way from a zoning perspective. If the lack of good new walkable places was just a function of restrictive land use policy, you would see more of this type of development in unincorporated parts of Texas counties!
I think another critical factor is that Seaside served as a model of success, which became the seed of a growing community of practice throughout the region. Seaside provided a example for developers and public officials to point at and say, "Wow, that model of development worked out great in the neighboring county. Let's build something like that here, too." People are much more likely to learn about models of development that are close by rather than across the country, because they're easier to go see in person and it's more likely that someone they know has been there. 

Planning departments are risk-averse, and they have lots of reasons to be that way. They get little credit when they approve an unconventional project that the public loves; meanwhile they get an earful if they approve one that the public hates. As a result, having a successful example of a new development model nearby makes it a much easier ask for an official to take a swing at a big idea.


Fun fact: Seaside was the movie set for The Truman Show!Nearby role models are possibly even more important for developers. One aspect of real estate that I didn't appreciate before is just how driven by comparables the industry is (known in the industry as "comps"). Developers are constantly asking themselves "What other projects in this region have succeeded? Which have failed?" and then shaping their projects to match the successes and avoid the failures. As a result, the industry is very self-referential and self-reinforcing. What gets built today is typically just a slight variation of what got built yesterday. Changing the zoning and building codes is risky, non-deterministic, and political; meanwhile it's much more straightforward to just do what's already been done.
Besides land use regulation, financing projects with debt is another Great Filter that kills innovative projects, or at least nudges them in a more conventional direction. Lenders are understandably risk-averse, because they get no upside if the project does spectacularly well. If a developer's bold bet pays off, the lender gets the same amount of money as if it did just ok; meanwhile the lender can lose all of their money if the project fails. As a result, lenders will often insist on making the project as similar as possible to something that they've already seen work. To lenders, boring is a feature not a bug.

The obvious way to avoid this Great Filter is to simply not use debt. However, leveraging a project with debt makes returns much more attractive to equity investors, so it's often necessary to make a project competitive as an investment. If real estate were funded by pure equity rather than debt, I think we would see a lot more experimentation. And indeed, the most innovative real estate projects are often funded by wealthy individuals with deep pockets who don't need to bring on debt to fill out the capital stack. If a project is special enough that it makes for outsized returns even without debt, then it can work out very well for investors in the end too. However, getting that multiple with debt doesn't require innovation in the end product, and thus feels safer to many investors.

Those rare innovative projects that do get built have outsized impact on the industry, because they can prove out a model that more conservative capital can then invest in. Seaside, FL was originally built by a single developer with a crazy idea and a piece of land he already owned, which gave him time and autonomy to build his vision. By contrast, most developers are working on literally borrowed time, so they don't have the luxury of experimenting with a new model.

But then once a place like Seaside has proven out a model, then other developers can take those learnings and apply them to projects with more conventional investors and lenders. As Seaside took off, nearby communities popped up along the Florida Panhandle following their playbook, including Alys Beach, Rosemary Beach, and Watercolor. Disney also took note of the Seaside model and built Celebration, FL following many of the same design principles. Developers just over the border in Georgia and South Carolina began to take note too, building beautiful places like I'On, Newpoint, Palmetto Bluff, Trillith, Serenbe, Habersham, and beyond.
Alys Beach, Florida
Rosemary Beach, Florida
Habersham, South Carolina
Serenbe, Georgia
Palmetto Bluff, South Carolina
These design patterns, loosely referred to as "New Urbanism", are slowly spreading from the South into the rest of the country. As you can see from the map at the top of this post, there are some lovely places popping up in Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, and beyond (and those are just my count – it's very likely that I'm missing some!). 

However the South is still the epicenter of this community of practice, and I can count on one hand the number of New Urbanist communities that have been built west of the Mississippi or north of the Mason-Dixon line. If we can show more people that these places are existing and thriving, and expand the community of practice beyond the Southeast, we will see more wonderful places built across America.

March 23rd, 2019
I recently spent a day at Sea Ranch, a strange and beautiful place. Sea Ranch is a planned community with a distinctive architectural style: simple timber-frame structures clad in wooden siding, and gardens all planted with native flora. The Sea Ranch Design Committee enforces strict design rules on all 1,800 homes along that 10-mile stretch of the Northern California coast. The result is a cohesive, calming aesthetic unlike anywhere else I've been.

Depending on who you ask, Sea Ranch is either the beautiful manifestation of a bold vision, or it's an exclusive dominion controlled by rules put in place generations ago. My view: both interpretations are correct. 
How did this eccentric place come to be? In the 1960s, a small group of architects bought the property, envisioning a community that harmonized with the environment. The guiding principle was to "live lightly on the land," inspired by the lifestyle of the native Pomo Indians. The architects created a strict master plan prescribing "clusters of unpainted wooden houses in large open meadow areas and not allowing fences or lawns." In the 50 years since, these guidelines have shaped Sea Ranch into something truly special, a sanctuary of natural beauty and subtle good taste.

This master plan is the key attraction, but it's also a major source of conflict. In 1972, California voters saw the private development as a threat to public coastal access, and, in direct response to Sea Ranch, they passed the Coastal Initiative to ensure public access to the state's beaches. With this regulatory change, the real estate developers who'd financed Sea Ranch wanted out.

This loss of control had a predictable result: The northern part was not developed according to the original plan. "Some folks say that there are essentially two Sea Ranches: the tasteful, quiet southern part and the suburban golf-playing northern sector," wrote Kenneth Caldwell in Archpaper. On one hand, this was a tragic collapse of an independent, bold vision. On the other hand, it was a victory for the freedom of the rest of the community to enjoy the coastline as they wished. Both interpretations are accurate, and both are important.The plan for Sea Ranch is an example both of an individual's singular vision and also of collective conformity necessary to execute that vision. It reminds me of the dramatic storyline in The Fountainhead about Cortlandt, a housing project designed by protagonist Howard Roark. When Roark learns that his design was compromised, he heroically dynamites the buildings to prevent the subversion of his vision. One interpretation: a case for individual expression. Another interpretation: Roark imposed his wishes on others regardless of the impact on their lives. Again, I sympathize with both interpretations. The divergence from Roark's brilliant vision was tragic, as was the destruction of what was built.

The Objectivists I know usually assert the first interpretation, emphasizing the moral power of individual genius. In their rhetoric, they defend everyone's right to have the freedom to execute the kind of vision that Howard Roark represents. Unfortunately, this goal of universality is impossible to achieve—if everyone were a lone visionary, their plans will conflict, and there will be no one to support them in implementing those plans. 

It's interesting that Ayn Rand chose to make her protagonist an architect, a profession whose work so deeply affects communities. The standard interpretation of The Fountainhead is as an allegory showing that freedom and self expression are a human birthright. But if Rand's sole intention was to glorify individual genius, why didn't she choose some other type of creative expression instead of architecture? When an architect designs a building, it affects the entire community. Many other forms of self-expression—sculpture, literature, or music—have effects that are far more contained. Why didn't she make Howard Roark a sculptor or a painter?

My reading is that this was a deliberate choice. I think that Rand understood very well that there is a tradeoff between the primacy of one man's vision and others' submission to that vision, and she was happy to bite that bullet.

What I takeaway from The Fountainhead is that Rand believed that some people are visionaries whose gifts the world should not suppress, and others are not worthy of that epic responsibility and should submit to the heroes' plans. I'm not sure if I agree, but I am quite sure that the universal individualism that most people ascribe to Ayn Rand's writing does not fit with the story she tells.

Sea Ranch's "enforced tastefulness" is even more invasive than the design of Rand's fictional housing project—an entire village of homeowners is submitting to the vision set by a few architects in 1965. The rules are rigid, prohibiting anyone's creativity but a small group of architects, long gone from the community. 

Yet as I wandered along the pristine, rugged cliffs, winding between the stunning homes that are each unique and yet formed a coherent whole, I had a hard time not feeling gratitude that there was a brief window in time in which architects reined over Sea Ranch. The place is special, and it would not be what it is today without that strict control. The important question to ask is: Was that worth trading off the independence of everyone else? That question is one I still don't know how to answer.

Thanks to the friends who've been part of the journey with me through these ideas over the past few years. You know who you are. ♥ 
Notes

I must admit that I haven't read The Fountainhead since high school. It is quite possible that my memory of it is simply a Rorschach test that reveals what I've been thinking about recently more than it does about what Ayn Rand meant to tell the world. 🙂

Finally, I usually try to balance the number of images with the actual amount of text in my essays, but the architectural style of Sea Ranch is so striking that I can't help but share more photos: #cities

 Digital vs analog error correction

                  Digital vs analog error correction
                  

May 3rd, 2020
The purpose of this writeup was to summarize something interesting I learned recently, to make sure I understood it. I figured others might find it interesting, too.
~ ~ ~

Digital signal processing corrects for errors better than its analog counterpart. This is one of the reasons why modern electronics are always digital.

Concretely, let's say you have a digital component that expects either 0V or 10V, and it outputs the same value it received as input.* In practice, we live in a noisy world, so the input it receives may not be exactly 0V or 10V. If the digital component receives an 8V input, it'll correct that error by "rounding up" and out 10V. Similarly, if the digital component receives a 3V input, it'll round down to 0V. It does not propagate the error but rather improves it before handing off its output as input to the next component. 

Another way to put it: digital components are resilient to minor errors coming in, and then they take that signal and construct the result within a more strict range. The outgoing result has less error than the incoming signal. The error bars of the input are bigger than the error bars of the output.

By contrast, analog inputs cannot do such a correction on a range, because they work by giving a continuous range of values rather than discrete values. This means that you cannot "round up" to the nearest accepted value, because all reals are accepted! Thus, as you chain analog inputs and outputs, you lose fidelity at every step, because you cannot correct for errors with confidence.

* You can think of this as the "identity component".

This FAQ is intended as a reference, covering the basic facts and current status of the project. My hope is that this document will help startup city builders learn from the path Próspera is carving. It covers a range of topics:infrastructure in Próspera and its neighborsHonduras' unique legal autonomy frameworkinstitutional structure of Prósperataxes and tariffsPróspera's business modelpolitical environment in Honduraslocal context, economy, and culture of Roatán, the island where Próspera is locatede-residency and physical residencycurrent population of Próspera and what made them to decide to move there... and more!

February 5th, 2022
I just spent a week in Panamá City, and figured I'd share my observations in case they're useful to anyone else interested in similar questions.

The purpose of the trip was to research locations for a gene therapy/stem cell clinic that my friend is planning to start. I also explored a few of Panamá's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as part of my ongoing research about startup cities, as well as to learn about the opportunities they offer for businesses like my friend's clinic.

The fact that this was a goal-oriented trip actually made it even more fun. I recommend this as a way to organize your travels. For me, travel is most satisfying when I have a concrete goal—in this case, "where's the best place to open a gene therapy clinic in Central America?"—because it forces you to actually learn about the place rather than take whatever path just happens to be pre-paved for tourists. You bump up against real constraints in the real world, rather than interacting with some manicured narrative of what the place is about. Best yet, you learn about what its future might be, not just the past.

Another reason I was excited to visit Panamá was that I lived in a tiny rural village called El Águila in 2010 as part of a high school exchange program. I hadn't been back in 12 years, so I was excited to reconnect with my host family. It was fascinating and invigorating to see how the country had changed!
But I'm getting ahead of myself. I've broken down my field notes into three sections:Stem cells, biotech, & regulationSEZs & new city developmentsPanamanian urbanism, economic development, & general observationsI. Stem cells, biotech, & regulationWe learned some conflicting information about the legal status of commercial stem cell treatments in Panamá, and I'm still trying to sort it out. If you know a doctor or lawyer who specializes in this area, I'd love to hear from you.

Before the trip, I did some online sleuthing to get some background on the issue. Highlights:Panama passed a law in 2004 making embryonic stem cell work illegal, which at the same time opened the door to legally working with adult stem cells in ways not yet approved in the US.Dr. Riordan at the Panama Stem Cell Institute has performed "over 10,000 procedures" using stem cells to treat autism and many other conditions since they opened in Panamá in 2006. (Parents' Guide to Cord Blood)They sell commercial stem cell treatments (e.g. they charge $13,000-$18,000 for autism treatments) so they're not just doing clinical trials, which you're not supposed to charge for.The article says that the clinic and lab are "fully licensed by the national medical authorities and adhere to international standards".The clinic registered a clinical trial for autism in 2014, which included 20 participants.The clinic was originally based in Costa Rica, but it moved to Panamá in 2006. (Stem Cell Transplant Institute)It appears that they moved because they were not allowed to perform treatments because "efficacy and safety were uncertain", although they were "allowed to store adult stem cells extracted from patients’ own fat tissue, bone marrow and donated umbilical cords".Stem cell treatments have since been approved by Costa Rica's government, and there are active clinics that offer these treatments to patients.BioXcellerator writes that "not only is stem cell therapy legal in Panama, it is quickly becoming one of the global leaders in research of non-surgical therapeutic options for care."
My general understanding from that pre-travel prep was that commercialization of stem cells is legal in Panamá, and that it's a small but growing industry. However, when I got boots on the ground, I began to hear different things...Firstly, there are very few stem cell clinics here. From talking to several medical professionals, I was only able to learn about two in the entire country: Stem Cell Institute and Cordon de Vida. This was surprising to me, since some uses of stem cells have been legal in the country since 2004 (as described above) and I'd expect droves of doctors to take advantage of the opportunity to serve medical tourists who can't get these treatments in the US.I met with a Panamanian orthopedic surgeon who's considering starting a stem cell clinic for medical tourism. He didn't seem terribly concerned about the legal status, though he hadn't opened the clinic yet so he may not be aware of the hurdles.
I met with "the only stem cell researcher in Panamá" to understand her perspective on the technology's legal status.She's opposed to commercialization of stem cells in Panamá for anything that (a) doesn't have lots of clinical trials first and (b) hasn't already gone through approvals through the Panamanian FDA.She considers it illegal to sell stem cell treatments in Panamá, since they don't meet either of those criteria.However, it's not really enforced so there are several commercial stem cell clinics that have popped up charging for "clinical trials", which you're not supposed to doShe's extremely excited about the future of stem cells, but just thinks it's too early to be offering them in a commercial setting. She believes that the technology is still at the stage where it's only ethical to use it in clinical trials, in which the patients do not pay for the treatment.She hopes that Panamá becomes a center for medical tourism because it is on the cutting edge but not because it's a haven for people escaping the US FDA.
Misc/related thoughts:I've heard there is a shortage of medical professionals in Panamá, which could be a barrier to becoming a medical tourism hub. Additionally, Panamanian labor law states that "only 10% of your business workforce can be filled by foreign workers", which means the shortage can't be solved by simply importing talent from elsewhere.Stem cell treatments are legal in Costa Rica and Colombia, so I'm planning a trip to those countries as well to dig into similar questions. If you know anyone I should speak to while I'm there, please let me know. I'm also open to other suggestions for places that welcome stem cell treatments.
My overall takeaway was that you could probably start a commercial clinic and possibly operate without problems for years, but you may get shut down or fined at some point in the future by the government. If anyone knows more details about this or can correct me, please reach out!II. Special Economic Zones & new city developmentsI visited three of Panamá's SEZs. I also met with a lawyer who specializes in Panamanian SEZs, which gave me a very helpful bird's eye view of how the legal frameworks that support the SEZs work.

Each SEZ in Panamá is different, but the general similarity is that they all provide benefits to their tenants such as:higher quality infrastructure than what's typically found outside of the zonea cluster of talent that is concentrated in a single focal pointspecial pre-built facilities (e.g. laboratories or warehouses)tax exemptions on tariffs, remittances, VAT, local direct taxes on capital, corporate income taxspecial immigration and labor incentives (e.g. ability to expedite visas)
I visited three SEZs: Ciudad del Saber, Panamá Pacífico, and Porta Norte. 

Project #1 – Ciudad del Saber ("City of Knowledge" in English)business model: non-profit foundation whose revenue comes from renting out facilities to businesses/institutionsit's been self-sufficient for many years now, though it started with a land grant from the government in 1998; took a credit line with a local bank for first 10 years + the EU gave matching funds → CDS paid all of this off by year 7120 hectares / 300 acres, 200 buildings (mostly built for the former Clayton US military base and now adapted to new uses)the idea was to "exchange soldiers for professors, bullets for books"rents out some housing (~100 houses I think), but it's not a central focusfocus on housing research, innovation, and NGOsbusinesses need to apply, meet a bunch of criteria, and get approved by CDS' board of directorstenants in CDS needs to support "innovation" in some way — they won't accept purely commercial operations, but they'll accept businesses that have a research componentthe board only meets 4x per year, so it takes some time to get established in CDSorganizations based in CDS include:stem cell manufacturer MediStemthe Red CrossUniversity of South Florida has a medical research labe.g. Dell wanted to put a call center at CDS, but CDS said "no" because it didn't have an innovation component and they established elsewhereCDS is considering hiring a liaison to help medtech companies within the zone to interact with Panamá's Ministry of Health, though that role doesn't yet exist

Henry, the founder of Porta Norte, gave us a tour of the construction siteThere are several different SEZ regimes in Panamá. To me they were an odd patchwork rather than something designed with an overarching vision in mind, though I suppose that's true of most things. Each of them has a complex set of constraints and rights that overlap with each other in unintuitive ways. This is my rough understanding of how they fit together, though please note that there is a lot more complexity to exactly how they work:A 1948 law created the Colón Free Zone. It provides tax incentives to entrepreneurs, and it was the first Free Trade Zone in the western hemisphere. I've heard it's falling apart and no longer considered cutting edge, but it was trailblazing in its time.A 1998 law created Ciudad del Saber which endowed a non-profit foundation with land. The non-profit rents facilities to "innovative" businesses, research institutions, and NGOs and is required to reinvest any profits back into the infrastructure of the zone.A 2004 law created Panamá Pacífico, which gave a private developer the right to buy up large swathes of land at a fixed price over the course of 40 years as it develops a warehouse area, a business park, and a residential area.A 2011 law allowed developers to apply to make their property a Free Trade Zone, regardless of where it is in the country. Before this law, if you wanted to start an FTZ, you had to get special legislation passed to get that status (e.g. the laws that enabled Colón and Panamá Pacífico). Now, it's just an application process (albeit a long and somewhat nondeterministic one, to my understanding).The land for the proposed FTZ must be at least 2 hectares, and it must be enclosed.There are now 20 FTZs in Panamá.This is the type of FTZ that Porta Norte is applying to become.
High level takeaways:Panamá has a unique situation that it has large swathes of land near the city. That land had previously been dozens of American military bases from when the US owned Panamá Canal. This gave the Panamanian government prime real estate to use for the development of SEZs. By contrast, most developments of that scale have to happen in farther off parts of a country, because the land closest to population centers has generally been consumed already.Having "innovation zones" that are specially decreed by the government to have special privileges seems to make them inflexible in what they're able to do, and as a result they end up being "overfit" to the needs of that time and in turn become obsolete quickly.The ongoing decay of Colón Free Zone seems to be an example of this. From afar, it seems to be an issue of being bound by rules that weren't flexible enough to adjust with the times.Although they both appear to be thriving, Panamá Pacifico and City of Knowledge gave me a sense of sterility and over-prescribed order that makes me worry that they may be inflexible in the future as the world changes around them.
Side note – The Open Zone Map is a useful resource for learning more about SEZs worldwide.III. Panamanian urbanism, economic development, & general observationsEconomic development: Panamá has achieved tremendous economic development since I was here as an exchange student 12 years ago. I got to see it up close and personal, because I reconnected with my host brother, Sami, and he has transformed his life since I saw him last. Seeing the progress they've made was one of the happiest experiences I've ever had. El Águila (the rural village where I lived in 2010) didn't have a paved road when I lived there. Since then, they've built a road that connects it to the rest of the country. While it used to take 4 hours to get to Panamá City from El Águila, it now takes 2-2.5 hours.When I lived there, El Águila didn't have running water, glass for windows, or electricity. Now they have all of those things.My host brother is now a lab technician at a biology research institute. He started out as a construction worker when he moved to Panamá City, but he loved biology, so he decided to do extra training on the side to learn how to work in a lab. He now works at Panamá's premier tropical diseases institute, Instituto Gorgas.Between 2010 and 2019, Panamanians' income more than doubled, as measured by PPP (Purchasing Power Parity).In 2010, Panamá's PPP was almost $15,000.In 2019, Panamá's PPP was almost $33,000.In 2020, Panamá's PPP sadly plummeted to $27,000 (I assume due to the pandemic), but hopefully they'll bounce back when the 2021 numbers come in.One of my Panamanian friends recently went to the passport office, which gives people in line a different colored slip depending on whether they are renewing their passport vs getting a passport for the first time. When he looked around, almost everyone there was getting their passport for the first time. He saw this as a great sign that more and more Panamanians are getting rich enough to travel abroad for the first time.
Me & Sami, my host brother
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of Panamá, USA, Mexico, ChinaUrban formBy and large, Panamá City is uncomfortable to walk around, but there is some really beautiful old colonial architecture. Also if you're into Miami-style modern high-rises, you'll definitely find something pretty comfortable. Casco Viejo is a beautiful old town. It's similar to Old San Juan in Puerto Rico if you're familiar with it, though at night it feels more unsafe and it's smaller and thus closer to slums.La Cinta Costera, the park that runs along the waterfront, is really lovely. Walking along the coastline at dusk is one of my favorite memories of Panamá City.It reminded me of South Pointe Park in Miami Beach, except with Brickell as a backdrop rather than South Beach's art deco buildings. There's a lively outdoor food court area that reminded me of Singapore's hawker stalls. It's right on the marina, so you can savor your ceviche while watching the fishermen haul in the corvina its made out of.Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the other parts of the city that I saw as much. I saw two types of neighborhoods primarily: (1) soulless high rises with huge setbacks, lacking trees (especially for what's needed in a place where the sun is so intense!), and separated by a sea of parking and traffic and (2) cramped, low-grade buildings packed in with informal slum housing made of tin and scraps.Comparisons to other cities you might be familiar with...Panamá City reminded me a lot of Singapore, except it's not as clean or safe and generally not as well done. Singapore's urbanism isn't really my style, but I see what it's going for, and Panamá is aiming for something similar.The Latin American city I'm most familiar with Buenos Aires, and so I find it a useful comparison point. Buenos Aires certainly has serious problems too, but its nice areas a much larger than Panamá City's nice areas. It's surprising if you just look at the PPP for each country, since Panamá's PPP is 50% higher than Argentina's. It's a good reminder that wealth as measured by PPP is not perfectly correlated with all good things (though it's certainly correlated with a lot of good things!).Even in the modern high rises, there were lots of haphazard details, e.g. I tripped over a step into a bathroom in fancy lawyer's that clearly didn't followed any building standards that would be typical in USA. This might be chalked up to my clumsiness though. 😉 There were also lots of surprisingly narrow hallways in miscellaneous places, which would definitely not be up to American fire codes but may be up to code here.Casco Viejo, the old part of Panamá City, is a beautiful neighborhood. Some of the buildings are abandoned however and have squatters, so you need to be careful when walking there at night.La Cinta Costera, the waterfront park, was one of my favorite spots in Panamá City.Unfortunately I didn't find any other neighborhoods I really liked. It was generally very car-oriented and barren of trees, which are so so so important when you're walking in 90℉ / 32℃ heat with 90% humidity.Panamanians are building a ton!They're building the Panamá City Metro and making great progress.The first line of the Metro was built in 3 years between 2011-2014, and the first phase of the second line was completed in 4 years.By contrast, it took NYC 10 years to build just 3 stations for the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway. (And that was just the construction! The original proposal was made 100 years ago, and an initial attempt at construction began in the 1970s.)In the region around Porta Norte, there are tons of other developments occurring at the same time. Those seemed to be more traditional suburban communities, but still exciting to see the country build so much and develop.

Panamanians have a very global, outward-looking culture:There is much more Asian influence in Panamá than I expected. I saw a lot of Chinese immigrants when I was here 12 years ago, but they didn't seem very assimilated, at least not in the countryside where I was living. In Panamá City today, most high end restaurants you go to are some sort of Panamanian-Asian fusion. Both Sami (my host brother) and Henry (the founder of Porta Norte) said that they eat Chinese style foods often. My trip also happened to coincide with Chinese New Year, and there was a huge celebration that took over the entire neighborhood where I was staying.From the people I spoke with (which admittedly is not an unbiased sample, though I did speak with people from all sorts of professions and income levels), they are all very positive towards global trade.Panamá was effectively a US colony for many years, so I thought perhaps there would be negativity against Americans, but the people I spoke with generally love America and want closer ties with it both economically and culturally.

Fun factsI learned that Zonians refers people associated with the Panama Canal Zone. The Zone was a political entity which existed between 1903 and the absorption of the Canal Zone into the Republic of Panama between 1979 and 1999. People born in the Zone received both Panamanian and American citizenship. John McCain is probably the most notable Zonian.Two routes were under consideration for the Panama Canal: Nicaragua & Panamá. A major selling point in favor of Panama was the flat arch of Santo Domingo Church. The centuries old arch is so structurally unsound that the builders knew Panama couldn't possibly have earthquakes.
As always, if you know something you think I might not know, give me a holler! I'm eager to learn more about Latin America, SEZs, biotech regulation, and the intersection of all three.

I hope these notes were helpful, or at least interesting, to you. If you ever need a consultant to investigate the legal or economic situation in another country like what I did in Panamá, let me know. I might be able to help.

 Messages sorted by:
[ date ]
[ thread ]
[ subject ]
[ author ]Now that PEP 572 is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a
PEP and find that so many people despise my decisions.

I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process. I'll
still be there for a while as an ordinary core dev, and I'll still be
available to mentor people -- possibly more available. But I'm basically
giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL, and you all will be on
your own.

After all that's eventually going to happen regardless -- there's still
that bus lurking around the corner, and I'm not getting younger... (I'll
spare you the list of medical issues.)

I am not going to appoint a successor.

So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A
dictatorship? A federation?

I'm not worried about the day to day decisions in the issue tracker or on
GitHub. Very rarely I get asked for an opinion, and usually it's not
actually important. So this can just be dealt with as it has always been.

The decisions that most matter are probably
- How are PEPs decided
- How are new core devs inducted

We may be able to write up processes for these things as PEPs (maybe those
PEPs will form a kind of constitution). But here's the catch. I'm going to
try and let you all (the current committers) figure it out for yourselves.

Note that there's still the CoC -- if you don't like that document your
only option might be to leave this group voluntarily. Perhaps there are
issues to decide like when should someone be kicked out (this could be
banning people from python-dev or python-ideas too, since those are also
covered by the CoC).

Finally. A reminder that the archives of this list are public (
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/) although membership
is closed (limited to core devs).

I'll still be here, but I'm trying to let you all figure something out for
yourselves. I'm tired, and need a very long break.

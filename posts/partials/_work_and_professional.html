<h3 id="the-stanford-review">The Stanford Review</h3>
<p>I am Editor Emeritus of <em><a href="http://stanfordreview.org">The Stanford Review</a></em>, a bi-weekly paper that publishes investigative news and opinions articles. Some of my favorite subjects to think &amp; write about are healthcare reform, the interplay between privacy &amp; technology, tax policy, rationality, artificial intelligence, and the Second Amendment.</p>
<h3 id="section-leading">Section Leading</h3>
<p>I am a section leader for Stanford&#39;s introductory programming classes, CS 106A and 106B, in which I teach Java and C++ to students with little to no prior coding experience. As someone who came into college with no prior exposure to programming, it&#39;s particular rewarding to see my students progress because I remember being in their position only a few years ago and know firsthand how much a little push from supportive friends can propel someone forward into the world of computer science. Teaching has also given me an even better understanding of the fundamentals of CS and an ability to communicate with people about technical problems.</p>

<h2 id="books-podcasts-blogs-that-i-like">Books, Podcasts, &amp; Blogs that I like</h2>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve shifted away from just reading text (paper or otherwise), as I&#39;m always trying to optimize my time and I&#39;ve discovered that it&#39;s easy to find time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks throughout my day while I&#39;m getting dressed or walking to my classes. Currently, some of my favorites include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Broker-Robert-Moses/dp/0394720245"><em>The Power Broker</em></a> is the biography of Robert Moses, who was the NYC Parks Commissioner from the 1920s through the 1960s. Moses is more responsible for reshaping the entire face of New York City than any other individual, and his thinking influenced urban planners nationwide and beyond throughout the 20th century. Over the course of his career, Moses personally conceived and completed projects costing 27 billion dollars, more than any other US government employee ever. These projects ranged from highways and bridges to housing complexes and city parks, many of which required bulldozing entire neighborhoods and in turn displacing hundreds of thousands of NYC residents. Despite the immense impact he&#39;s had on the field of urban planning, Moses was never elected to public office. The book is not only a look into Moses&#39; fascinating life but also a unique perspective on American history and urban planning during that half century. Aside from the intensity of the story itself, the research that went into this masterpiece is just awe-inspring. The author Robert Caro is the best researcher-writer whose work I have ever read. His exhaustive series on LBJ is also fantastic; although it&#39;s more well-known and even more ridiculously in-depth than The Power Broker, I enjoyed the story about Moses a bit more because his impact was more concrete and on a more understandable scale. Also, <em>The Power Broker</em> is a story about taking a seemingly insignificant position and wielding it in a way that massively amplifies its power, whereas LBJ&#39;s story is more about climbing the ladder until you&#39;re at the top. As a side note, the narrator for the Audible recording of is fantastic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/"><em>You Are Not So Smart</em> podcast</a>, which explores self delusion, common logical fallacies, and the influence of cognitive biases on our thinking.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://hpmor.com"><em>Harry Potter &amp; the Methods of Rationality</em></a>, an alternate universe in which Harry is a child prodigy raised by scientists and &quot;enters the wizarding world armed with Enlightenment ideals and the experimental spirit&quot;. I highly suggest the <a href="http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/">HPMOR podcast</a>, which can be found on <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>, among other places. My fitness this winter can be attributed more to this audiobook than any other single thing-- I&#39;d start off on a run or walk with my dogs and realize hours later that I&#39;d burned through 10 chapters and it was getting dark out. Long story short-- HMPOR is fantastic.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/radio/freakonomics-radio-podcast-archive/"><em>Freakonomics Radio</em></a>, a weekly podcast that discusses &quot;the hidden side of everything&quot;. My favorite episodes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/12/11/the-troubled-cremation-of-stevie-the-cat-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/">&quot;The Troubled Cremation of Stevie the Cat&quot;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/11/13/why-do-people-keep-having-children-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">&quot;Why Do People Keep Having Children?&quot;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/10/09/how-to-raise-money-without-killing-a-kitten-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/">&quot;How to Raise Money Without Killing a Kitten&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hayek&#39;s <em>The Road to Serfdom</em>, which argues that when economic power is centralized in central planning by the government, it almost inevitably results in tyrannical dictatorship and the creation of a repressive society.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://99pi.org"><em>99% Invisible</em></a>, a podcast about design, architecture, and urban planning. In a parallel universe I would have loved to be an architect, so this podcast is my weekly dose of how buildings and spaces affect the history around them. 99pi makes me consider aspects of cities I donâ€™t normally think about, and it&#39;s particularly fun to listen to while walking through the SoMa district in San Francico on my way to work each morning. The episodes are nicely bite-sized too, about 25 minutes each.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://npr.org/sections/money"><em>Planet Money</em></a>, a podcast that deep-dives into some aspect of the economy twice a week. In one episode, they documented the process of creating an off-shore company, and in another they put $1,000 into shorting the US stock market. Tragically, I finally finished the hundreds of episodes recorded since Planet Money debuted in 2008, so now I have to actually wait a few days between each episode!</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Cryptonomicon</em> by Neal Stephenson, a cyberpunk novel that follows the intertwined exploits of a cryptanalyst working alongside Alan Turing in the 1940s, a morphine-addicted marine in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and a nerdy programmer in the 1990s who creates a safe haven for data in a world where government and corporations seek to control the flow of knowledge. Think <em>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> mashed up with <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em>, and you get <em>Cryptonomicon</em>. This book manages to be extremely fun and thought-provoking at the same time.</p>

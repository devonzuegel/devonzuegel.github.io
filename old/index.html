                  prior exposure to programming, it&#39;s particularly rewarding to see my students progress because I remember
                  being in their position only a few years ago and know firsthand how much a little push from supportive friends
                  can propel someone forward into the world of computer science. Teaching has also given me an even better
                  understanding of the fundamentals of CS and an ability to communicate with people about technical problems.

                      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Broker-Robert-Moses/dp/0394720245"><em>The Power Broker</em></a> is
                      the biography of Robert Moses, who was the NYC Parks Commissioner from the 1920s through the 1960s. Moses is
                      more responsible for reshaping the entire face of New York City than any other individual, and his thinking
                      influenced urban planners nationwide and beyond throughout the 20th century. Over the course of his career,
                      Moses personally conceived and completed projects costing 27 billion dollars, more than any other US
                      government employee ever. These projects ranged from highways and bridges to housing complexes and city
                      parks, many of which required bulldozing entire neighborhoods and in turn displacing hundreds of thousands
                      of NYC residents. Despite the immense impact he&#39;s had on the field of urban planning, Moses was never
                      elected to public office. The book is not only a look into Moses&#39; fascinating life but also a unique
                      perspective on American history and urban planning during that half century. Aside from the intensity of the
                      story itself, the research that went into this masterpiece is just awe-inspring. The author Robert Caro is
                      the best researcher-writer whose work I have ever read. His exhaustive series on LBJ is also fantastic;
                      although it&#39;s more well-known and even more ridiculously in-depth than The Power Broker, I enjoyed the
                      story about Moses a bit more because his impact was more concrete and on a more understandable scale. Also,
                      <em>The Power Broker</em> is a story about taking a seemingly insignificant position and wielding it in a
                      way that massively amplifies its power, whereas LBJ&#39;s story is more about climbing the ladder until
                      you&#39;re at the top. As a side note, the narrator for the Audible recording of is fantastic.

                      the city, I had learned about the hippies on Haight Street and the gay-friendly culture of the Castro, but
                      this book opened my eyes to a whole new level of richness in the city&#39;s history. I learned gems like the
                      fact that Jim Jones and The People&#39;s Temple (of the infamous 1978 Jonestown koolaid massacre)

                      >. As a result, Moscone appointed Jones as the chairman of the SF Housing Authority Commission, and Jones
                      gained access to California politicians like Governor Jerry Brown, SF Supervisors Dianne Feinstein and
                      Harvey Milk, and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. In exchange for his cult&#39;s political support, these figures
                      supported him and The People&#39;s Temple up until the day the news came in of the mass suicide at
                      Jonestown. This shocking episode is just one of the incredible stories I learned about San Francisco&#39;s
                      history from <em>SOTW</em>, and it completely reshaped the way I think about the city. From Jonestown and
                      the Zebra Murders to Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, I can sum up what I learned in a brief sentence: SF
                      during the span of the 60s and 70s was the real Gotham City.

                      describes the steady decline of violence over the course of human history. I was initially skeptical of
                      Pinker&#39;s thesis, but I can&#39;t see any way that you wouldn&#39;t be convinced of his argument after
                      reading through the exhaustive research in this book. As a bonus,
                      <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em> will leave you extremely optimistic about human progress, though at
                      the same time you&#39;ll be horrified by how people have treated each other throughout most of human
                      history.

                      childhood (wayy better than <em>Harry Potter</em>...). The books&#39; writing is so good and its themes are
                      so enduring that I still reread them every once in a while. These books also carry the honor of being the
                      best-quality audiobooks I&#39;ve ever listened to; rather than just one narrator reading the entire story,
                      each character in <em>HDM</em> is read by a different actor from a famous London Shakespearian troupe, and
                      DAMN they do a fantastic job. Some of my best childhood memories are road trips with my family, listening to
                      the series on our way to Yosemite.

                      <a href="http://hpmor.com"><em>Harry Potter &amp; the Methods of Rationality</em></a> takes place an
                      alternate universe in which Harry is a child prodigy raised by scientists and &quot;enters the wizarding
                      world armed with Enlightenment ideals and the experimental spirit&quot;. I highly suggest the

                      attributed more to this audiobook than any other single thing-- I&#39;d start off on a run or walk with my
                      dogs and realize hours later that I&#39;d burned through 10 chapters and it was getting dark out. Long story
                      short-- HMPOR is fantastic.

                      argues that when economic power is centralized in central planning by the government, it almost inevitably
                      results in tyrannical dictatorship and the creation of a repressive society.

                  Many of the people I&#39;m closest to I originally met because their personal websites and tweets were
                  interesting and I figured they were probably pretty cool, too. I highly recommend it as a strategy for meeting
                  cool people. Here are a few of the blogs that have influenced me the most:

                      Scott Alexander&#39;s <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com">Slate Star Codex</a> has (benevolently) forced me
                      to reconsider my views more than any other single source of information and thought. His background as a
                      clinical phsychiatrist (he is currently finishing up his doctor&#39;s residency) is different from that of
                      most of the people I talk to, and that alone is very refreshing. He comes to issues ranging from feminism to
                      the state of pharmaceutical testing with extremely original perspectives. In particular he has piqued my
                      interest in meta-analysis of science. Not only are his ideas fantastic, but I&#39;m blown away how prolific
                      he is. He blogs multiple times a week, bordering on every day, and yet each post consistently makes me
                      totally reconsider the topic at hand. Scott also just seems like a genuinely good person who wants to make
                      the world a better place with his work. My intellectual development over the past year would have been much,
                      much slower without Slate Star Codex in my life. I hope you check it out!

                        My friend Michael Nielsen described what&#39;s so wonderful about Scott&#39;s writing:
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>
                            Most essayists try to develop a story with a neat conclusion. But Scott develops 5 stories, all
                            potentially the truth, all somewhat in conflict, and he tries to push them all through to the end as
                            powerfully as possible. So his essays aren’t about pushing a conclusion. Rather, they’re about
                            exploring (and relating) several different ideas about where the truth may lie, to the best of his
                            ability. It’s a very powerful literary form.
                          </p>

                      Since we&#39;re already on the topic of Michael... <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/">his site</a> is also
                      wonderful! The blog spans topics like Machine Learning, digital explanations and representations, and
                      incentive structures within academia. When I first discovered it, I spent the better part of a weekend
                      reading it all the way through and tweeting questions, comments, and my favorite quotes at him. Highly
                      recommend!

                      <a href="http://99pi.org"><em>99% Invisible</em></a> is about design, architecture, and urban planning. In a
                      parallel universe I would have loved to be an architect, so this podcast is my weekly dose of how buildings
                      and spaces affect the history around them. 99pi makes me consider aspects of cities I don’t normally think
                      about, and it&#39;s particularly fun to listen to while walking through the SoMa district in San Francico on
                      my way to work each morning. The episodes are nicely bite-sized too, about 25 minutes each. While the
                      content of the show is great, the most unique part is that the podcast is just beautifully done – it is
                      really a piece of audio art, with so much more depth and richness than traditional radio, and Roman
                      Mars&#39; (the host) voice is like velvet.

                      twice a week. In one episode, they documented the process of creating an off-shore company, and in another
                      they put $1,000 into shorting the US stock market. Tragically, I finally finished the hundreds of episodes
                      recorded since Planet Money debuted in 2008, so now I have to actually wait a few days between each episode!

                      historians whose areas of expertise are the 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s respectively. Each episode takes a
                      single theme (e.g. &quot;Body Politics: Disability in America&quot;, &quot;Banned: A History of
                      Censorship&quot;, &quot;Fear Tactics: A History of Domestic Terrorism&quot;), and over the course of an hour
                      they use that theme as a lens to look through a range of time periods in American history. The show is very
                      high quality, and I&#39;ve learned a lot of things about US history that I likely never would have learned

  <div class="post-content"><p>The news is saturated with stories and opinions on guns, and the attention on the<br />issue is heightened with this past year’s dramatic shootings in Aurora and Newtown.<br />Understandably, the response to these horrors involves great emotion. However, in our<br />dialogue about violence and gun ownership, we need to set aside our fears and biases<br />and look at where the facts lead us.</p>

<p>Here in the Bay Area, the general response to gun ownership is an automatic “no,” and<br />the Stanford campus is no exception. Our campus sees minimal violence and our main<br />exposure to firearms is through the news, where killings are stories rather than the<br />cases with peaceful endings.</p>

<p>This anti-gun bias is reflected in campus policy and state law. On its website,<br />Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) states that “all [firearms]<br />are prohibited on Stanford Campus … except for sworn police officers,” and California<br />has mandated absolute firearm bans on all college campuses. These policies assume<br />that guns are fundamentally harmful. Remembering that a weapon is simply a powerful<br />tool that can be used for self-defense as well as for harm, we need to reconsider<br />Stanford’s “Gun-Free Zone” policy.</p>

<h2>Gun-Free Zones: A monopoly of force</h2>

<p>Absolute bans are ineffective, as criminals carry weapons regardless of their<br />legality. Worse, Gun-Free Zones are uniquely attractive targets, as a monopoly of<br />force is in the hands of whoever is willing to break the law, and police response is<br />often too little and too late.</p>

<p>When Seung-Hui Cho shot his first two victims at Virginia Tech in 2007, the police<br />unsuccessfully searched for the shooter for two hours. Cho remained in public spaces<br />on campus for that entire time and even went to the post office to mail writings and<br />recordings to NBC News. He then walked to a building of lecture halls at the opposite<br />end of campus, chained the three main entrance doors shut, and killed 30 people in a<br />second attack lasting roughly 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The rampage ended with Cho’s suicide. With over 200 rounds left, “he was well<br />prepared to continue,” said State Police Superintendent William Flaherty. Unarmed,<br />the victims had no hope but to make barricades and wait for the police to arrive,<br />which happened well after the massacre was over.</p>

<p>The shootings at Columbine and Sandy Hook also ended in the perpetrators’ suicide,<br />not police intervention. According to a U.S. Secret Service study into 37 school<br />shootings, “Over half of the attacks were resolved or ended before law enforcement<br />responded to the scene. In these cases, the attacker was stopped by faculty or fellow<br />students, decided to stop shooting on his own, or killed himself.”</p>

<p>It is wrong to disarm an individual when effective protection cannot be provided in<br />compensation, and relying on police officers and security guards has proven to be<br />insufficient. When targets of violence, people have the right to options beyond<br />waiting for help to come.</p>

<h2>The right tool for the job</h2>

<p>It is generally agreed that self-defense is a valid response to violence. However,<br />when faced with an armed attacker in any situation, fighting back with nothing but<br />your fists is the worst option. Victims need a tool that can level the playing field<br />against all sorts of attackers.</p>

<p>According to a 1997 study of National Crime Victimization Survey data by PhD<br />criminologist Gary Kleck, &quot;robbery and assault victims who used a gun to resist were<br />less likely to be attacked or to suffer an injury than those who did not resist at<br />all or those who used any other methods of self-protection.” The probability of<br />serious injury to a female victim is 2.5 times greater when no resistance is offered<br />and 4 times greater when resistance is offered without a gun. The same study showed<br />similar trends for male victims, though the magnitude of the statistics was<br />diminished.</p>

<p>As a 5’ 3” girl, I am going to need a better tool than my fists if I get grabbed one<br />night on the way home from my physics lab. Some friends of mine carry mace or Tasers<br />for this very reason. While they are better tools than wrestling, they can be<br />ineffective and even counterproductive. Pepper spray can rebound into its user’s eyes<br />to disable his own along with those of his assailant; one-use only, Tasers are<br />ineffective against more than one assailant and don’t work through thick clothing;<br />and both have a very limited range.</p>

<p>With the limitations of other options in mind, a concealed handgun is a much more<br />effective tool for self-defense. Along with overcoming the technical weaknesses of<br />pepper spray and Tasers, guns pose a much greater deterrent to criminals. Many<br />incidents involving a victim with a gun end without a single shot. When someone draws<br />a concealed gun in self-defense, the criminal simply retreats 55.5% of the time,<br />according to Kleck.</p>

<p>Before discussing concealed carry permits, it is crucial that I am clear on what they<br />are and, more importantly, what they are not. Concealed carry permit (CCP) holders<br />are not vigilantes with the duty to protect; in fact, it is strictly against laws and<br />their training. There are consequences for acting unless they themselves are in<br />immediate danger. Extending to campuses, the right to carry would simply allow CCP<br />holders the same abilities and responsibilities they have in most other places.</p>

<h2>More Guns, more crime… right?</h2>

<p>While faculty, staff, and students deserve the same rights to self-defense in their<br />place of work and study as others have, it is an understandable concern that allowing<br />concealed guns would lead to more accidents and crime. Fortunately, this concern has<br />not been realized.</p>

<p>After a combined total of one hundred semesters, none of the twelve colleges across<br />the country--Colorado State University, Blue Ridge Community College in Virginia, and<br />ten public colleges spanning 30 campus in Utah--that allow licensed individuals to<br />carry on campus has seen a single incident of gun theft, accident, or violence,<br />including threats and suicides. In addition, all Utah educators have been able to<br />carry concealed weapons to work for the past 12 years, in which there have been no<br />accidents or shootings in the schools.</p>

<p>CCP holders are statistically a very law-abiding group. According to each state’s<br />Department of Public Safety, .007% of Florida CCPs over the last 25 years and .005%<br />of North Carolina CCPs over the last five years were revoked due to a firearm-related<br />crime. The felony rate of CCP holders in North Carolina is .017%, more than 20 times<br />less than the national rate of .35%.</p>

<p>Not only are people who carry concealed weapons less likely to commit crimes, they<br />can also prevent and stop them from happening.</p>

<p>In a mass-shooting, the perpetrator is looking to have complete power. &quot;They&#39;re the<br />puppet master,” said Dr. Mary Ellen O&#39;Toole, a retired FBI profiler. “They&#39;ve got the<br />control, the power, the weapons.” If potential targets are armed, they are far less<br />tantalizing. The Aurora shooter had a choice of seven movie theaters within 20<br />minutes of his home. The one he ultimately chose wasn’t the closest but rather the<br />only one that that banned concealed handguns. Holmes chose the theater in which his<br />victims were most vulnerable.</p>

<p>In isolated attacks when the attacker’s motive is a more tangible gain--a mugging,<br />for instance--the possibility of an armed target will cause the attacker to rethink.<br />A wallet is not worth the risk of being shot.</p>

<p>Beyond preventing these crimes from happening in the first place, there are countless<br />examples of CCP holders ending attacks early and widening the timeframe for escape<br />and police response. Here just a few examples of mass-murders ending early due to<br />armed victims: in 2007, a shooter was stopped by a CCP holder in a Colorado church<br />after killing two people; in April 2012, a knifing spree in a Salt Lake City mall was<br />stopped by a CCP holder when he drew his gun and told the attacker to drop his<br />weapon; and just a few weeks ago in early December, a shooter at a Clackamas mall<br />stopped his spree and killed himself when he saw a 22-year-old CCP holder pull his<br />own gun. Stories of isolated self-defense from the past month alone include: an Ohio<br />gas station clerk shooting a robber; an AutoZone employee scaring off a robber with a<br />gun; and a pastor pulling a gun on a burglar who broke into his church.</p>

<p>Violence elicits particularly strong fears and emotions. When discussing the role of<br />guns in our society, we need to rein in those fears and emotions, base our decisions<br />on facts and statistics, and remember that guns are tools that can save lives, too.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content"><h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Alzheimer&#39;s is the <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/local/survey-alzheimer-s-most-feared-disease-in-america/article_7d9dfa65-2483-5927-9bcb-44a2e38babf7">most feared disease in America</a>. All terminal illnesses bring loss and grief, but memory-robbing dementia is particularly upsetting. Our memories are the basis of our identity, and each time we lose one we lose a little bit of ourself.</p>

<p>However, even the healthiest memory has gaps. In fact, people are unable to remember most details of their life, and the all of the memories we do have are at least somewhat inaccurate. Every time a memory is recalled, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/how-many-of-your-memories-are-fake/281558/">we reconstruct it</a> by telling a story about ourselves and integrating things we really do remember in detail. <a href="https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusBernsteinInHealy05.pdf">Memories can be contaminated with events that never happened</a> and planted in someone&#39;s mind if they are exposed to misinformation or asked suggestive questions.</p>

<!-- The following excerpt, which is from a short story called [*Lenny Hearts Eunice*](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/14/lenny-hearts-eunice), captured this transformation and associated terror perfectly: -->
<blockquote>
  <p>At every moment our brains and synapses are being rebuilt and rewired with maddening disregard for our personalities, so that each year, each month, each day we transform into different people, utterly unfaithful iterations of our original selves.</p>

  <p>â€“ from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/14/lenny-hearts-eunice"><em>Lenny Hearts Eunice</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The realization that our mind does not simply record and retrieve information but instead <em>constructs</em> it is deeply unsettling.</p>

<!-- This discomfort initiates two kinds of responses. On one hand, the fallibility of our memory forces us to reconsider our sense of self and the world around us. On the other, we seek ways to overcome the shortcomings of memory. -->
<h2>Oral Cultures</h2>

<p>In his short story <a href="http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang"><em>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</em></a>, Ted Chiang describes our current state of memory as a sort of &quot;private oral culture&quot; and imagines a future in which new technologies continue to extend and augment our identities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each of us is a private oral culture. We rewrite our pasts to suit our needs and support the story we tell about ourselves... But that era is coming to an end. As [memory prostheses] gain widespread adoption, we will be replacing our malleable organic memories with perfect digital archives. We will have a record of what we actually did instead of stories that evolve over repeated tellings. <strong>Within our minds, each of us will be transformed from an oral culture into a literate one.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early civilizations were oral cultures, in which traditions and knowledge were subtly modified as they were passed from one generation to the next. Their histories were gradually adjusted over time to suit the needs of the present. As a result, these cultures understood the past differently from literate cultures like our own. As civilizations adopted the use of writing, malleable organic histories were replaced by precise written ones.</p>

<p>Ironically, the act of recording the past made it possible to have multiple interpretations of the same events. Literacy give us a way to pin an idea down, enabling analysis and a shared starting point for debate. Records enriched the importance and complexity of the past by giving us new tools to reflect upon their meaning.</p>

<p>Literacy has evolved to encompass far more than just the written word. People now express themselves and understand others through a vast set of media, from indie films to symphony orchestras and performance art to Snapchat. Culture has been captured, disseminated, and analyzed for generations, but the vast majority of individual perspectives has been irretrievably lost. Humans have developed technology to record tradition and knowledge for millennia, but only now have we begun to record and analyze individual experience.</p>

<h2>The Entire History of You: The Bad</h2>

<p>I recently watched a short film called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2089050/"><em>The Entire History of You</em></a> which depicts a future in which everyone has a perfect catalogue of memories captured by a &quot;grain&quot; embedded in their skull. Everyone can play back &quot;re-dos&quot; of their memories and share them with friends.</p>

<p>Intuitively, the idea of having a grain is beautiful and enticing. The ability to reconstruct every moment with perfect accuracy sounds like a superpower that could solve many of our personal and societal problems.</p>

<p>However, the film shows a dark side of this technology. The story follows Liam, whose obsession with re-dos transform his small prick of jealousy towards his wife&#39;s ex-boyfriend Jonas into full-blown paranoia. Liam seems unreasonably possessive throughout the show, but in the end we discover through footage of various recorded memories that he was right all along. Fi and Jonas had cheated on him eighteen months ago, suspiciously close to the time their daughter was coceived. In the end, the truth comes out, and Liam&#39;s life is ruined.</p>

<p>As we move ever closer to this reality of ubiquitous recording, <em>The Entire History of You</em> raises fascinating questions about the benefits and costs of this sort of technology. Technology is just a tool, with the potential to amplify our flaws as well as our virtues. A firearm can be used for self defense or rebellion against a tyrannical government, but a mass murderer can use that same weapon to terrorize a school or movie theater. Automobiles offer a whole new level of freedom and mobility, but they are also a source of immense social problems like pollution, segregation, and car accidents. Similarly, media technology has the potential to extend and enrich human experience, but it also comes with great responsibility to manage that superpower of enhanced perception.</p>

<p>It is up to us to decide whether the advantages of prosthetic memory outweigh its sacrifices. Meanwhile, the effects of information technology are far more subtle than that of concrete technology like guns and cars. This abstraction makes it all the more important that we think hard about its effects before plunging into the future.</p>

<h2>Truth and Justice</h2>

<!-- *The Entire History of You* emphasises the dark side of prosthetic memory, but it also eludes to its advantages in the realm of security and justice. When Liam boards a flight, he provides access to the last few days' memories to the airport security staff, ensuring that none of the passengers plan on causing trouble. When he attacks Jonas later in the episode, the "Grain-Free" woman is unable to record the events and share them with the police on the on the other end of the line, revealing the costs of not embracing the technology. We may not have grains implanted behind our ears like the characters in the film, but smartphones, dash cams, and police body cams have already radically changed how the justice system works. -->
<p>Reliance on organic memory does not always surface the truth and serve justice. Eyewitness testimony is shockingly inaccurate. <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/free-innocent/improve-the-law/fact-sheets/dna-exonerations-nationwide">73 percent</a> of convictions overturned through DNA testing were based on eyewitness testimony, and memory researchers have discovered that questioning can significantly alter witnesses&#39; testimony.</p>

<p>In one study, people watched footage of car accidents. Afterwards, those who were asked, &quot;How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?&quot; gave higher estimates than those with whom the verb &quot;hit&quot; was used, and those who were told that the cars had &quot;contacted&quot; each other gave the lowest estimates. Those asked about cars smashing into one another were more than twice as likely as others to report seeing broken glass when asked about the accident a week later, even though there was none in the video.</p>

<p>In another study, U.S. soldiers enrolled in a survival school endured abusive interrogations as part of training. Afterward, many were shown a photo of someone who looked nothing like their interrogator, and interviewers insinuated that the person depicted was the culprit. <a href="http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/04/5227/">84 percent misidentified their interrogators.</a></p>

<p>Our judicial system has a tragic history of pretending that human memory is infallible. It depends on eyewitness testimony as a source of truth rather than what it really is â€“â€“ an unreliable, constructed narrative. If we could instead use perfect recordings of events, justice would be far more achievable.</p>

<p>Adoption of prosthetic memories could also foster greater trust and accountability in society. Police agencies have begun to experiment with on-duty body cams, with promising results. They report decreased use of force and fewer complaints from residents, and on-officer video cameras improve officers&#39; behavior and relations with the public. One <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-015-9237-8">study</a> found that &quot;officers are more proactive with this technology without increasing their use of invasive strategies that may threaten the legitimacy of the organization&quot;. In short, officers are more cautious and risk averse when wearing body cameras. The researchers concluded that officers thought more carefully about criminal policy and procedures when on duty, because video evidence creates the potential for greater scrutiny by supervisors or members of the public.</p>

<p>The benefits of artificial memory extend beyond the public sphere into the private one, as well. My greatest hope for artificial memory is that it helps us develop a stronger culture of self-reflection and acknowledge our own fallibility. We&#39;re generally terrible at accepting criticism from others, because our immediate reaction is to be defensive rather than open-minded. However, it is critical that one get an honest picture of themself in order to take a personal inventory, reflect, and improve. If we had technology like a grain, we would be able to make many of these observations in private, where we could have a more measured, thoughtful response.</p>

<!-- > Digital memory will ... change those stories from fabulations that emphasize our best acts and elide our worst, into ones that acknowledge our fallibility and make us less judgmental about the fallibility of others.
>
> â€“ Ted Chiang.
 -->
<p>Our steady adoption of artificial memory is just the latest iteration of Strand and Weston&#39;s &quot;quest for a kind of objective truth assured by a quasi-scientific procedure and closed, finished perfection&quot;[^RobotCheck]. However, prosthetic memories will never offer a perfect answer to all complex questions. There will always be grey areas and multiple interpretations of the facts.</p>

<h2>Living Records</h2>

<p>The founding documents of the USA are a great example of how even an eduring record leaves many unsettled questions. We have an entire institution, the Supreme Court, set up to interpret the meaning of the Constitution. Despite the fact that the words printed in this document have been unaltered in the 240 years since they were written, our interpretation of those words has changed immensely.</p>

<p><img style='max-width: 100%; margin: 5px 0' src="http://bigvalleygrace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o-SUPREME-COURT-BUILDING-facebook.jpg"/></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon">The Dress</a>), subject of a viral controversy as to whether it was blue and black or white and gold, revealed differences in human color perception that should give us pause before relying on artificial memory as a source of truth. Color is a kind of <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/qualia/">qualia</a>, &quot;the subjective or qualitative properties of experiences ... [that] cannot be identified with or reduced to anything physical&quot;. Each person&#39;s grasp of reality is shaped by a mixture of direct experience, their personal background, and qualia. As a result, a washed out photograph of a dress has multiple interpretations, just as the Constitution has been understood differently by various people over time.</p>

<p><img style='max-width: 50%; float: right; margin: 15px 0' src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a8/The_Dress_(viral_phenomenon).png"/></p>

<p>Not only will prosthetic memory not solve all of our problems, but it will also cause many of its own. Some of these are predictable, but because this technological and cultural evolution will create a world unlike anything we&#39;ve seen before, there will also be many issues that are impossible to predict ahead of time.</p>

<p>For one, artifical memories may further our tendency for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>. Access to information can actually lead to worse models of the world around us, because we selectively seek information to support their existing perspectives of the world. For example, greater scientific literacy is linked to rejecting climate change. &quot;People with higher scientific comprehension use their abilities not to disinterestedly parse the complicated details of climate science, but to better fit available evidence to their preexisting values and group identifications&quot;, found a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n10/full/nclimate1547">study</a> from Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School.</p>

<p>Constant recording may also decrease our risk tolerance and creativity. If we knew that there was a possibility that people could access our own memories or play back footage of us, we would likely censor ourselves, stifle creativity, take fewer emotional and intellectual risks out of fear of embarrassment. In The Social Psychology of Creativity, Teresa Amabile described a study that investigated the effects of an evaluative audience on creativity. One group of subjects believed they were being watched by experts who were evaluating their work. A second group believed they were being similarly evaluated by a non expert audience through a one-way mirror. The third group expected their work to be evaluated afterwards, with no expectation that they were being watched. In the control condition, subjects worked with neither an audience nor an expectation of being evaluated later. The study showed that the presence of others concentrating on an individual&#39;s work disrupts their creativity.</p>

<p>An even more pernicious prospect is that our willingness to change our mind and admit when we are wrong may diminish. If there is a record of our old views, it makes it that much more costly to let it go in favor of a more enlightened opinion. Politicians offer a good model for what we might become under these conditions. They are infamous for evading questions them by raising new ones as a response and for making nice sounding statements with no real substance. But who can blame them? When their every move is being watched and compared against their past selves in search of inconsistencies, it is safest to take a neutral position or ideally stay silent on an issue. This safeguards them from the risk of needing to change their stance in the future or saying something contradictory by accident.</p>

<p>From the outside, it seems like it would be easy enough to just turn off the recording, delete virtual memories, or do away with the device altogether if it would result in a better outcome. After all, technology only increases optionality, since we still have the choice to not use it. However, it is not quite that straightforward. Humans are hoarders, so unless there is an immediate cost to keeping a memory it is unlikely that it would be deleted, for fear that it might be useful or a source of happy nostalgia one day. The film references this tendency by showing that Fi chose to not delete the recording of having sex with Jonas; even though she knew there was a chance that Liam would force her to show him the video at the risk of uncovering the affair, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to delete it because she held the memory too dearly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the game theoretic structure of the situation means that nearly everyone would end up having a grain, even if they would be better off if they all didn&#39;t have one. This sort of technology offers major advantages to its user, enabling them to get ahead of anyone who doesn&#39;t have a virtual memory. There would be more than enough incentive to get onboard to get that competitive edge. Over time as virtual memories grew in popularity, not having a grain would be disadvantaging yourself, equivalent to choosing to be illiterate would be a massive liability in today&#39;s society.</p>

<p>The rise of prosthetic memory seems inevitable. We&#39;re already moving in this direction, and our appetite for sharing chunks of our personal lives through social media only seems to be growing, so the idea that we might be recording and sharing firsthand memories like the characters in Black Mirror isn&#39;t too much of a stretch.</p>

<p>The question of whether or not such a prosthetic memory is a desirable step forward boils down to the question plaguing all advances in technology â€“â€“ do we trust humans to use to tool wisely to improve ourselves and society, or will our irrationality and vices overtake our impulses and make abuse the technology? Following the shift from oral to written cultures analogy, I have high hopes that artifical memory will do far more good than harm. Memory prosthetics will make us historians of our own lives, so hopefully this also enable us reflect upon and curb on our tendency to abuse technology.</p>

### Misc ###

- "We don't normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated," explained Ted Chiang in [*The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling*](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang). "We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound."
- "Their histories don't need to be accurate so much as they need to validate the community's understanding of itself. So it wouldn't be correct to say that their histories are unreliable; their histories do what they need to do," explains Ted Chiang.
- Combined with the horror that when you die, you're consciousness, memory, and entire identity die with you.
- at a dinner party at which Jonas, one of Fi's ex-boyfriends, is also a guest. Liam becomes suspicious of how much attention Fi pays to Jonas, and afterwards he discovers that she had downplayed their relationship, saying it lasted only a week. Over the course of the conversation, she lets it slip that it lasted a month, and later she admits it was six months. that night he watches re-dos of the dinner party repeatedly while drinking heavily.  his jealousy and paranoia.
- couple, Liam and Ffion, whose marriage is destroyed by his suspicion and her betrayal. Liam's small prick of jealousy at the beginning of the episode gets fuel from his obesssion with replaying footage from a dinner party with Fi's friends.
- "inattentional blindness" â€“â€“ Invisible Gorilla test â€“â€“ if people are asked to focus on a video of other people passing basketballs, about half of watchers missed a person in a gorilla suit walking in and out of the scene thumping its chest
    - History of pretending / assuming that human memory is infallible â€¦ maybe perfect recordings of events would aid the demise of usage of eyewitness testimony

### Not yet ###

- New acceptance of technology 
- historians of our own lives.
- This anxiety makes the idea of a prosthetic memory very enticing.
- the reliance on prosthetic memory as a "source of truth" implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully... But this is clearly incorrect
- Pictures are often taken as a definitive record of what happened. Often, when an argument happens on the internet, someone making a claim will be asked for "Pics or it didn't happen".
    - having perfect recordings doesn't necessarily mean all questions will be settled
- biases in sports
    - "The home team gets a knee-jerk defense, no matter the evidence against it â€” and other teams get schadenfreude when the ball deflates the other way"
    - these biases come into play in the most important of situations
    - intergroup discrimination
    - selective perception
    - heavy use of adverbs (e.g. "deliberately kicked") when discussing the other team's behavior

## Dangers ##

- we should look to Shereshevskii as a glimpse at what we might become if we have immediate retrieval of all relevant memories. "Reading a passage of text evoked so many images in Shereshevskii's mind that he often couldn't focus on what it actually said, and his awareness of innumerable specific examples made it difficult for him to understand abstract concepts" (NOT SURE IF I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS)
- breakdown of trust â€“â€“ less reliance on trust â€¦ less reliance on "benefit of the doubt" and "agree to disagree" on past events â€¦ breakdown of relationships
    - pinpointing blame wasn't the answer. Instead, couples needed to acknowledge each other's feelings and address their problems as a team
    - too easy to pinpoint blame, no more need to work on the actual issue and be a "team" â€¦ to easy to "keep score"
- We all make mistakes; sometimes as entire societies we make mistakes â€¦ but both as societies and individuals we need to learn to forgive and forget. Forgetting is an important part of forgiveness.
    - "the relationship between those two actions wasn't so straightforward. In most cases we had to forget a little bit before we could forgive; when we no longer experienced the pain as fresh, the insult was easier to forgive, which in turn made it less memorable"
    - "By fixing every detail of an insult in indelible video, it could prevent the softening that's needed for forgiveness to begin"
    - seeing certain photos on Facebook brings me back to angering times â€¦ brings up raw emotions that we'd nearly forgotten
    - "She and I had many furious arguments during her teen years, arguments that we have mostly been able to put behind us, and now our relationship is pretty good. If we'd had Remem, would we still be speaking to each other?"
    - Even if each of us could have refrained from throwing the other's bad behavior in their faces, the opportunity to privately rewatch video of our arguments seems like it could be pernicious
- ...
- END THIS SECTION WITH (GOOD TRANSITION TO INEVITABILITY)
    - but the reality of the situation is quite a bit different â€¦ access to cookies at home; nutritionists suggest we only stock our house with healthy foods so we aren't tempted to snack on calorie foods.

<p>I love sharing little tips and tricks I&#39;ve incorporated into my workflow, so I&#39;m excited to write up this post surveying the key customizations I&#39;ve made. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I&#39;ve enjoyed writing it.</p>

<p>Better yet, I love learning new ways to better use Sublime!

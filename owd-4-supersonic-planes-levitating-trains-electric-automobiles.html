                    Devon, and in this series I get to talk about cities with the most interesting couple I know, Alain and
                    Marie-Agnes. In our last conversation, we talked about sanitation and public health. It included astonishing
                    stories of their experience with these systems, in the dozens of cities where they've lived and worked.

                    One highlight was when Alain recounted the time that he had his appendix removed in Yemen, and discovered that
                    the doctor had run out of Novocaine. Anyways, I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you haven't heard that
                    episode I highly recommend it. Today we'll talk about transportation. Since thes have lived and worked in so
                    many cities around the world, they have a broad and deep perspective on the factors that affect how
                    transportation systems function in different contexts.

                    So for the first question, some countries are notorious for reckless driving. They treat stop signs as
                    suggestions rather than a rule. The drivers will weave in and out of lanes without signaling. Meanwhile, other
                    countries have a reputation for extremely cautious drivers. What's the cause of this huge difference?

                    I think it's not regulations, it is norms. People in some countries, respect rules by tradition, and other do
                    not. The rules of the road, are about the same in every country. In some countries there is, maybe, a complete
                    distrust of government. I'm thinking of probably one of the worst type of traffic I've seen, is in Egypt. In
                    Cairo, but also in Egypt, in general. And I think that it comes from a mistrust of government, that everything
                    government does is suspect of corruption.

                    It could be also that in countries that have been occupied for a long time by foreigners, people have less
                    confidence in government than in countries which have been self-governing. And Egypt, maybe people do not
                    remember that, but the last time Egypt were governed by Egyptians were by the pharaohs before Ptolemies, and
                    then the next time was when Nasser took over from King Farouk, I think, in 1956 or something like that. King
                    Farouk was imposed by the British in Egypt . And he was originally an Albanian, so he was not an Egyptian.

                    So I think that if you are governed by a foreign power, anything you do against the rule of the foreign power
                    is patriotic, and you are encouraged to break the rules. And I think that breaking driving rules is a bit like
                    that, I think.

                    It's a hypothesis, of course, but the long shadow of history, I believe in that. That people have a narrative
                    of history, and they have a certain attitude, again, norms, who are different from regulation. The fact that
                    you respect some regulation or you don't respect them, and if nobody respect them, it's unenforceable. If you
                    bring a cop from Singapore, and you bring him in Cairo, the guy will become nuts within 24 hours because he
                    will not be able to enforce the law, because everybody break the law all the time.

                    I think you will have to do the opposite. You have to replace the entire driving force of Egypt with
                    Singaporeans, of course you won't have enough Singaporeans, because it's the drivers, really, that make the
                    norms. If you have a policeman who try to enforce a law but he has 100 offenders in 10 minutes, he will not be
                    able to do his job. By the time he writes a ticket, there will be 20 people who have passed the red light
                    without stopping.

                    You were talking about Singapore was so regulated, and people will obey the law. And one time you were saying
                    if you import a number of foreigners in Singapore and they don't cross when the light is for pedestrians, they
                    cross at any time, it happens in many cities-

                    Like I'm doing many times, especially in Switzerland where people are so obeying of the law, and there is no
                    traffic and no one dare to cross the road if the light doesn't come green for the pedestrians. But if you
                    import many people like me in Singapore, the police will be overwhelmed.

                    Overwhelmed, yes, yes. Yes, you see that. But that reinforces, again, the point. Look at the countries which
                    are very respectful of law. You could have Switzerland, for instance. You'll have the Scandinavian countries
                    which has never been occupied by other countries. You will have New Zealand, Australia, also. They are very
                    respectful. They're a country which have a tradition to be self-governing.

                    So in the US, actually, the US contradicts my theory a bit, because New York is not really respectful. But
                    say, other cities are more. But let's say San Francisco, I think, is more respectful of traffic than ... So I
                    don't know. Maybe in the case of New York it's the very large number of immigrants. I understand, if I
                    remember well, something like 45% of people who live in New York are not born in the US. So most probably,
                    they were born in countries which were they were not self-governing in a traditional way. I don't know, I'm
                    trying to justify my theory.

                    It sounds like if you ... According to that theory, then it would predict that the way you learned how to
                    drive, depending on where you were, would then predict how you behaved later. If you learn how to drive in, I
                    don't know, India, which I think has a very, very ... Crazy drivers, then you come to the US, do you think
                    that you would be more likely to have crazy driving norms? Like disrespecting the rules a little bit more? Or
                    do you think we can assimilate quickly into whatever the norms are of the area that you're in?

                    I think you assimilate if you're alone. If you learn to drive, if you have your license in Egypt or in India,
                    but for some reason you move to Singapore or Switzerland, I am sure within a week you'll follow the rules
                    because you'll have accumulated so many tickets, because you are the only one to do it.

                    And so I think it's not so much how you learn, it's more the practice. Let's say you adapt to the norms of
                    your peers, and if your peers are breaking the law in a way ... That's what an Egyptian taxi driver told me
                    one day, when I asked him, "Why do you go through the red light without stopping?" And he says, "Well, because
                    everybody does it." So you see, it's game theory in a way, that you expect other people to behave in a certain
                    way and you adjust your behavior to the way other people behave.

                    Yeah, I was told a story by one of my friends who was from Argentina, and he spent some time in Bolivia. And
                    he said that in Bolivia, there are a lot of intersections where people don't stop at all. They completely
                    ignore the light, keep going, and they'll just go, go, go. And then, as soon as there's a gap, then the other
                    side will start going and go, go, go. And so everyone gets really stuck because if there's enough traffic,
                    then there's just this constant stream and you can never break through.

                    And in that case, I think, I follow the rules pretty carefully when I'm driving in the United States. But if I
                    was in Bolivia and I have to get where I'm going, I think I would probably do the same thing, because
                    otherwise you're just going to be stuck there because you're never going to find that gap at the same time as
                    the green light.

                    Let's say, I think Sweden, for instance, or Singapore, both have pretty strict driving norms, and people are
                    very cautious on the street. What would you do? Let's say you wanted to make their norms more dangerous and
                    you wanted people to be more reckless on the road. How would you cause that cultural change?

                    I would import five million drivers from Cairo. But you have to do it at the same time. If you import them 10
                    or 100 at a time, it won't work.

                    Don't forget that also, in Singapore, like also I would say New Zealand or Switzerland, certainly, it's not
                    only the cops who intervene. It's also the people who look at you. In Switzerland, they will say, "Why'd you
                    cross? It's not your turn to cross," because they expect people to follow the rules. And for them, this is a
                    rule.

                    And so I think it's enforced also by the population, not necessarily only by the cops. You see everybody
                    standing and looking at you and you feel a little bad, self conscious, so you don't do it any more.

                    Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be surprised if the social norms were actually stronger than the
                    policing norms in a lot of places, where you don't do it because you don't want your friends to judge you,
                    more than that you're worried about the police.

                    That's right, yeah. Yeah. In a certain way, that's why in the United States, you mow your lawn, and you feel
                    obliged to mow your lawn if the grass is too high. You feel a little self conscious, also, compared to the
                    neighbor. You are very comfortable having tall grass in your yard, but you feel that other people might object
                    ... And you try not to antagonize your neighbors.

                    Transportation is a really big part of a culture. I think it's something that's kind of underrated, when
                    people talk about the culture of France or the culture of Japan. They usually talk about the food or the wine,
                    or the way people talk and the language, but I think the way people move around really affects the culture and
                    vibe of the city as well.

                    The kinds of interactions that you have with other people are very different if you're in a car versus on a
                    bike, versus on the subway, versus walking around. And you two have lived in a lot of different cities, and
                    worked in even more cities. I'm curious, how does the mix of transit modes impact the culture and vibe a city
                    that you've been in?

                    When we arrived in Yemen, I will say that in Sanaa, there were probably 300 or 400 cars, so very, very few
                    cars. Most people would have either motorcycles, and there were not that many either, and then donkeys and
                    camels. But most people in Sanaa would just walk. The city at the time was 80,000 people, and pretty high
                    density, so you could walk.

                    There is no doubt that if you are one of the few people with cars, you tend to be a little more ruthless
                    because people fear you. They know that they are going to be hurt more than you, and it give a sense of
                    hierarchy, which is very unhealthy.

                    I think also then after that, when people get richer and there are more people having cars, let's say 20% or
                    30%, which is the case now probably in urban India at least. Then you still have the arrogance of the people
                    with cars, saying that, "I have acquired this car. This is new. This give me a certain power over other
                    people," and the feeling that the roads are designed for cars, the cars have priorities.

                    So it give a sense of hierarchy which is very unhealthy. I think that the country which are more middle class
                    and have an older tradition of being rich, that mean the car is not a new thing, probably drive more
                    carefully. When I was in Nepal the first time in 1963, there were no roads between the two main cities,
                    Kathmandu and Pokhara, and people walked the distance. It's about 200 kilometers, if I remember well, between
                    the two cities. And there was a trail, and people were walking. Entire family were walking from one city to
                    another with their luggage.

                    A lot of porters, also. They hire a lot of porters. There no animals, because in the mountains there were a
                    lot of staircase which were carved in the rock in the mountain. So it was a country where just everybody walk.
                    And rich people would have porters, and poor people just carry their own load. It give a completely, also,
                    different attitude. I found it very nice, but I was young and very healthy, and liked to hike, so that was
                    fine. Maybe at my age now I would not find it so nice to walk with a load 200 kilometers.

                    Yeah, we were living in Thailand. You'd be stuck in traffic for hours without almost moving, and then you
                    realize that you were not alone. Public transport was not too well organized. Most of them were kind of
                    motorbike with three wheels, with some seat on the back. Those one were more flexible, and the most motorbike
                    being not as large as a car, so they would be passing in front of you continuously and squeezing in between
                    lines of car.

                    And after then, some time, the city decided to have some bus transportation be organized. And things get a
                    little bit better, but still, the richer people didn't take the public transport. And we were working for a
                    company run by the government, National Housing Authority. And they have the good idea to have an air
                    conditioning bus, very comfortable, so we abandoned our car and took the air conditioning bus. We did not mind
                    riding in the bus and be stuck in the traffic because it was very nice to be in a cool atmosphere and you
                    could read. At that time, we didn't have internet, but I believe now they may have WiFi on the bus and you can
                    start shooting some emails there and there, or reading your email in the bus.

                    Public transport, I should say, is a plus for a city, especially when it's comfortable. I don't see, in New
                    York, unfortunately, me taking the metro or a bus, because they are not as comfortable and you cannot rely too
                    much on the metro. You can, but many time we were ... At one point, living in New York for three months in
                    Manhattan, and we were commuting from the place in Battery Park to NYU, New York University.

                    And many time, we have to calculate the time traveling, saying instead to take 20 minutes, we'll take close to
                    45 minutes. Double the time, because subway were not on time. The subway would stop in between station. You
                    were in the dark. So it's the comfort of public transportation is really a necessity for many people,
                    especially for old people like we are.

                    Right, yeah, and if you have an option that you can afford, that's more comfortable, then you might as well
                    take that. But then it ends up resulting in more of a separation of different types of people, which is
                    probably unfortunate.

                    Yeah. I usually try to take public transport in all the cities I work in, just as an experience and to see. I
                    like to go to the end of the line to see what happens there. Say in some cities like, again, for instance in
                    Seoul or in Beijing or Shanghai, taking the subway is a pleasure. It's kind of comfortable. I remember in
                    Mumbai taking the suburban train, and I could not get out at the stop I was trying to get out because it was
                    so crowded.

                    So after that my Indian friend told me, "You have to know, if you take the train, three or four stations
                    before your station, you have already to move closer to the door. If not, you will never be able to exit, and
                    you'll have to take, after, the train in the other direction in order to get to your station."

                    So you see that you need an experience like that to ... I think it's useful to always ... I mean, if you are
                    interested in cities, to take public transport sometimes. Not always, but sometime, in order to have
                    experience and most people experience, it give you a very good idea of what the city's like.

                    I remember seeing some Tweets about people being quite frustrated, I believe it was with the Board of the MTA
                    in New York, I think. And a bunch of the board members drove to work every day instead of actually using the
                    subway or any of the public transport, which I'm pretty sympathetic to that frustration, because how are you
                    really going to know what the priorities are if you're not using the system?

                    So, Marie-Agnes, yesterday you shared with me an article about the 15 minute city idea that the Mayor of Paris
                    is pushing forward. Can you describe that idea? And I'm super curious to hear both of your reactions to that.

                    Yeah, the Mayor of Paris who get reelected recently, the big program now is to make Paris walkable and have
                    maximum 15 minute from your place you leave, to the place you work, the place you shop, either walking or
                    bicycling. And as you know, cities are not only good like a Club Med, where you do your 15 minutes exercise
                    every day in the morning and 15 minute coming back.

                    A city, ... And Alain may explain better, it's part of his book, the city is job market. It works if you can
                    go from one part of the city to another within less than an hour. And for Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris, if she
                    wants to implement this kind of program, she will have to make a number of street cyclable or pedestrian, and
                    enlarge the sidewalk or do ... And she started already, do convert some of the main interior of Paris,
                    especially along the Seine River, converted to only pedestrian and bicycle.

                    And before it was the two side of the Seine was highways, and now of course the Parisian who were living in
                    the center of Paris loved this idea. But that penalized all of the other people who need the car to provide
                    services to the city. So Alain can jump on it and explain more, but a topic of things, Paris is not Rotterdam.
                    It's not Amsterdam, it is much larger, and the cities need good transportation.

                            The core of Paris is being transformed into a "15-minute city", the idea that every Paris resident

                    Yeah, sometimes it's ... The model is usually Amsterdam, or Copenhagen. Amsterdam is 700,000 people, and
                    Copenhagen, depending the way you count, about a million, million and a half. And it's completely flat. The
                    municipality of Paris is two and a half million people, but it's surrounded by suburbs and it's a city of 10
                    million people.

                    So she's the mayor of the two and a half million people who are in the center of the city, very well served by
                    heavily subsidized public transit. The subway of Paris is really pretty good. The station are renewed and
                    redecorated periodically, and so you could have, if you have a job in Paris, and you live in Paris, you
                    probably ... Maybe 15 minutes would be difficult, but say 20 minutes, 25 minutes would be rather common.

                    Unfortunately, Paris now, the Paris municipality, that means the constituency of the mayor, is entirely
                    gentrified. She's not saying every Parisian should have 15 minutes trip, she's saying only the people who are
                    in the gentrified area, with a transport system paid at 90% by the French tax payer, should be able to have 15
                    minutes.

                    And of course, even that, it's a luxury. She had this idea that jobs will be created a bit everywhere. Jobs
                    tend to concentrate in some area, and less in others. So when it comes to things like the grocery store or
                    schools, or things like that, yes. And in Paris, they are already well distributed, because they're zoning yo
                    prevent shops to establish whenever they like ... There is no zoning which differentiate residential from
                    commercial in Paris, even for an office building. You can convert a house into an office building, or an
                    office building into a house, or a grocery store, without practically any permit.

                    So that's already achieved. What the mayor doesn't seem to understand is that people go to Paris to work, and
                    more and more jobs are in fact outside the municipality of Paris boundary. I think I show that in my book,
                    because that's part of this gentrification. Many companies find that real estate is so expensive in Paris,
                    again, because of the amenities which are there, which are so attractive for people who are rich enough to
                    afford it.

                    So many job have moved outside Paris municipality to the suburbs, where there, of course, they are out of
                    reach from the superb transport within the municipality of Paris. So it's a bit elitist, and strangely enough,
                    she's a socialist but she's a socialist elected by elitist people. By the people who have gentrified the city.
                    So it's a very interesting aspect of politics, I think.

                    Aesthetically, I think it seems sort of for the people, by the people, sort of thing? Just, it sounds nice and
                    it sounds like it's a good thing, it's going to make little villages inside of Paris, so I kind of see how
                    those two things go together even though actually, the results of such a system would be quite anti-socialist.

                    It's very inequitable, because it's the people who can afford a house of a million dollars or more who'll have
                    free transport. And the people who live in the suburbs, the people who are baking the bread and contributing
                    to the economy of the city, eight million people, will be outside this system and will have to drive because
                    some who work in Paris could take public transport. But most of the other from suburb to suburb have to drive,
                    and they will not benefit from this system. On the contrary, they will be penalized.

                    And then there are ... In a city like Paris, you have also a lot of people who absolutely need a car to go
                    around. For instance, if you are an electrician and you are repairing the electricity of buildings and things
                    like that, you cannot take the subway. You have to have a car, because you have your tools, you have your
                    material there.

                          so the Central Business District (CBD) ended up in La Défense where there are fewer land use
                          constraints. This is atypical; in most cities, CBDs tend to develop at the center of the city, not on
                          the outskirts.

                    let's say, if you are delivering beer to restaurants in Paris, instead of doing 10 delivery in the day, you
                    are going to do three because there are so few roads that you can use.

                    And that means that either your salary will be much less or that whatever you deliver will be much more
                    expensive. Probably a bit of the two. So it's not really well thought of, it's kind of a utopian ... And very
                    elitist. It's very elitist, because again, the jobs which remain in Paris, except for the service job, again,
                    in restaurants are corporate jobs. But many of the corporate jobs are the highest paying job. You have
                    corporate lawyers or the headquarter of corporation in Paris, but most of the employees will be in the suburb
                    because real estate is so expensive.

                    So again, it's extremely inequitable. But of course, the name Paris means the municipality. That means there's
                    two and a half million people who are living in the center of Paris, so it's a ... But the gentrification in
                    the last 50 years have been incredible. I mean, if I compare to the time when we were students, there were
                    really working class neighborhood inside Paris municipality. And you don't see them anymore.

                    high end stores like haute couture or a thing like that. So I'm not against it. I think it's a normal
                    phenomenon. But to pretend that this is for the people is not quite true. There is an enormous gentrification.

                    Do you think that Anne Hidalgo, that the mayor, understands this dynamic and she's sort of cynically pushing
                    it forward as a nice political move because the people in her district who voted her in support it? Or do you
                    think she actually just doesn't really understand the dynamics and she believes that this will have a positive

                    I think she's part of what the French call the gauche caviar, the caviar left. It's people who are
                    intellectuals, you know, they are part of the elite. They make a good living. They feel a little bad about it
                    because the French that are always raised on the ideal of the French Revolution, of Liberté, Egalité,
                    Fraternité. And they compensate, let's say they are in a privileged situation by pretending that they are very
                    ... They want to share, they want to be social ... And I think it's, she probably knows inside herself that
                    it's not quite right... But her constituency is this gauche caviar, also. It's caviar left.

                    And so in a way, it's a good way of getting reelected too. The people who have a one or two million dollars
                    house in Paris don't care so much about the electrician who is going to fix their air conditioner or anything
                    like that. I mean, the guy will always come anyways, so that's not one of their problem. And they are very
                    unlikely to go and work in the suburbs.

                    But you could see the anger of people during the Gilets Jaunes, the demonstration. I don't know if you have
                    followed that in Paris, before the COVID. There were these demonstration every weekend. People were coming
                    from the suburbs or from the province to Paris, and they were trashing monuments, but also high end
                    restaurants, high end shops. And that was really this anger. I mean, I don't think this was legitimate.
                    Vandalism is never justified. But there was this anger against this enormous gentrification that benefited
                    from enormous subsidies.

                    I will add that also, she was elected because there is a big movement, as in many other countries, the Green
                    have been electing Hidalgo because she promised also to have more green space in a city in Paris, and she's
                    converting parking into parks. Not bad, but the things are, the people, the Parisian, love the idea to have a
                    park next door. That makes apartment more valuable because you have a park next door. So the movement of Green
                    are also pushing this idea of having transport, having less car in the city, and go by foot and go by bicycle.

                    It will be worse than them, I mean when ... The contrast between the life in Paris and the life in the suburb
                    will be much, much larger. Suddenly over there, it's so ... Because Paris is full of monument which are
                    extremely well maintained. There is a large central government budget to maintain those monuments. For, let's
                    say, the bridges on the Seine, some of them which were built in the 19th century, have golden decoration on
                    it. And this gold is reapplied.

                    barrier. These "fuseaux de protection", which protect the view from one area of Paris to some monument, the
                    Arc de Triomphe or the Louvre or a thing like that, make Paris like a theater in a way.

                    It's very beautiful. It's a very ... But, of course, it prevents any addition of floor space within Paris. So
                    as the economy develop, and business cannot expand within Paris because you have this absolute limit to the
                    floor space which is there. Corporations tend to keep their headquarter in Paris for the prestige,but for only
                    a few offices and conference room.

                    Now with the Internet, you could have the ruling elite of a company in a building in the center of Paris where
                    90% of the worker are in some lousy suburbs, at 20 kilometers from there. And it doesn't affect the management
                    at all, because they communicate by internet and so all the information is transmitted even faster than it was
                    when they were all in the same building. So this is convergence of things, it's quite interesting, and the
                    effect it has on social segregation.

                    That's fascinating, yeah. I mean, it sounds like the tradeoff that the municipality has made is to preserve
                    central Paris as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with the gold plated bridges, and the
                    monuments with the great view throughout the whole city. But then there's this cost of pushing jobs and people
                    outside of the city core.

                    The French are very proud of Paris, because it's only large city in France. Paris is 10 million. The next
                    cities, Marseille and Lyon, both of them are one million. So it's a huge drop, and that's because of the
                    centralization of the French system, centralization which came at a time of themonarchy, but was even
                    reinforced at the Revolution.

                    And the French Revolution took place in Paris. It was really a Parisian thing, and it was imposed on the
                    province to the point that they were provincial states, which would be the equivalent of states in the United
                    States. For instance, Provence or Gascony, where entities traditionally which were rather large. And the
                    Revolution destroyed all of that, and divided the country into 90 departments.

                    So imagine if the United States had Washington DC, and then everything else would be a county. You will have
                    the federal government and the county government, without states. You will have an enormous centralization of
                    power, by necessity, and this is exactly what happened in France. So this centralization of power, then,
                    resulted in even a democratic government tend to spend more money in the place where they live. The deputies,
                    they live in Paris. They may represent Marseille, but they basically live in Paris, so they will spend more
                    money on Paris maintenance.

                    And, of course, Paris is the symbol of France much more than Marseille or Bordeaux, or something, where the
                    United States is so much more decentralized, or even a country like Germany, for instance. It's much more
                    decentralized by definition. Berlin is one thing, but you have Hamburg, you have Stuttgart, you have
                    Frankfurt. You have Munich. Each city is a bit equivalent, in a way, with a very different personality. That's
                    not the case in France, where Paris completely dominates. Everything is done in Paris.

                    So in a way, the privilege of Paris reflect a very deep cultural tradition in France against starting from the
                    17th century, Louis XIV, and reinforced, interestingly enough, by the Revolution.

                    One country that's very similar to France in this regard is Japan. Tokyo is one of the biggest, by far the
                    biggest city in Japan, and it's really very quite centralized there. Do they have similar histories that
                    caused that centralization, or did they centralize for different reasons?

                    I suppose that it's a bit similar, although it's a different story. The shogun, traditionally, were a very
                    centralized power. And then they moved. And then when they were replaced again by the emperor, the idea that
                    there is an emperor was, I think, reinforced the thing. And yes, it's possible that it's a bit equivalent,
                    although a city like Osaka is still very large. Osaka is what, 25 million, I think? Yeah, something like that,
                    30 million people. I mean, it's not insignificant.

                    Tokyo itself is 40 million, if I remember well. But Tokyo Yokohama is close to 40 million, so it's a big city.
                    But there is more a hierarchy of city, I think, in Japan. But it's possible, too, that the power of the
                    central government in Japan is very high. Maybe similar to what it is in France, kind of a centralized power.

                    For instance, the Japanese have an industrial policy for distributing industry and subsidizing industry within
                    the country, which is very similar to France, too. France has exactly the same system. So it's possible.

                    I think that even a country like Mexico, if Mexico City is 25 million people and the next city is much
                    smaller, it's again because of centralization of power. Although Mexico is a federal republic, but still, the
                    political power is really in Mexico City. And when sometime Mexican planners are saying, "Well, we should
                    encourage the growth of smaller cities, Mexico is unmanageable," things like that, but this will never work
                    unless the change the centralization of power that's inherent, again, probably the republic. Maybe it come to
                    the history of the republic

                    I wonder how the Shinkansen in Japan impacted centralization of the country. For people listening, the
                    Shinkansen is the high speed train system, and it's been around for about 50 years in Japan. And it links a
                    bunch of different distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, and the whole purpose of it was to aid economic growth
                    and development around the country.

                    But my instinct, now ... I'm curious if you two agree with this. My instinct is that by connecting all of
                    these regions to Tokyo, it just accelerated the consolidation into the center of the country, and into Tokyo,
                    because now everyone can be linked up to headquarters of their company, and there's less regional development.
                    And I say that descriptively, not normatively. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. But does that
                    make sense to you?

                    I think that in itself, the high speed train could promote decentralization. It could. But if you combine the
                    high speed train with the demographic problem that Japan has since about 30 years now, aging population, then
                    I think that the growth of Tokyo ... Tokyo now is practically the only city which is growing in Japan, and
                    it's growing not ...

                    The population of Japan is shrinking slightly, so it's growing because young people are coming from smaller
                    city. If they look for a job, they want to look for a job in Tokyo, not in a city where you have a majority of
                    old people. And Tokyo also is much more attractive for young people because of its amenities, restaurant,
                    thing like that.

                    As soon as a city is dominated by old people, the quality of the amenities disappears. So I think that the
                    centralization now, the growth of Tokyo, is explained more by the demographic. And it's possible that the fast
                    train allow young people to go to Tokyo several time to test the water, find a job, and then go back home. And
                    then eventually, settle in Tokyo. That's possible.

                    >
                    But I think that it could go either way. For instance, when they established the TGV, which is a bit
                    equivalent of the Shinkansen, in France, a rapid train between Paris and the province, I know that in my own
                    town of Marseille, as soon as the TVG reach ... So we were at five hours from Paris instead of 12 hours, it
                    increased the real estate crisis in Marseille, increasing housing prices, and the same with Nantes and
                    Bordeaux, the other big cities.

                    So I think that the fast train could go either way. And then France could be either way. I'm not so sure that
                    will be a big influence in reinforcing, let's say, the primacy of the capital.

                    In Japan, when we were there, we went to a small town on the west coast of Japan, Toyama. The mayor was trying
                    to ... There was a fast train, from Tokyo to Toyama, it took two and a half hours. And the mayor was very
                    concerned, because all the young people were leaving Toyama and moving to live close to Tokyo, and only the
                    old people would stay there. And the city of Toyama was doing well before the fast train, and suddenly, you
                    have all the suburb of Toyama get deserted by the young people.
                  </div>

                    >
                    And so the mayor wanted to suppress the infrastructure for the outskirt of Toyama, because it was too costing
                    to provide services to the few houses who were still occupied. And he proposed to the old people to move to
                    the center of Toyama in converted school, all the stadium and everything, for lodging for the old people. And
                    giving to the old people the chance to be living in an apartment building with all the amenities, doctors,
                    nurse, hospital close by. All the service that old people need to attract those old people back to the center,
                    and eliminate all the infrastructure that was provided before for the larger area were doing well before.

                    So this is, again, the fast train was a big problem for the Toyama city, and I don't know if you'll have the
                    chance to get back the young people. The mayor was giving incentive to Microsoft people to have their office
                    in Toyama, thinking that the young people will not have to commute anymore to Tokyo.

                    But things didn't work ever, so there is a lot of problem with the young people want to have access to more
                    job and change job eventually, and if you are in a small town now, it's not so easy. Maybe with the Internet,
                    how we've ... The young people will be going back to the country. But who knows what's next?

                    Yeah, the incentives there are so interesting. A friend of mine lives in Japan and he told me about these
                    residential taxes that Japanese cities impose on you, so I'm going to get the details wrong, but basically
                    you're supposed to pay 10% of your tax to the town that you live in directly.

                    For many people that is Tokyo, but there was this rule that was passed a little while back called the Hometown
                    Tax, and basically the rule said something like, "If you send 3% of the 10% back to your hometown, then you
                    get a rebate on where you currently live." So say you grew up in Kyoto, but now you live in Tokyo. Instead of
                    paying 10% to Tokyo, you could send 3% back to Kyoto and only pay 7% to Tokyo.
                  </div>

                    And some of the smaller towns started realizing that they didn't actually define what hometown meant. There
                    was no specific definition of saying you had to be born there. It was just sort of this fuzzy term, and so
                    they started sending gifts to people who gave the 3% back to them. And some of those gifts would end up being
                    extraordinarily expensive, for instance, if you gave 3% back, they might spend up to 2% to buy you plane
                    tickets to come visit your hometown, and basically you get a free vacation.

                    And there's this whole system now of gifts that towns will give you, and people will often choose particularly
                    idyllic towns that they have basically no connection to. But they just want a free vacation, to go visit.

                    That's a difficult question. I'm sure it does work at times, but I cannot think of anything right now. Well,
                    in France we have a Minister of Culture, which a big budget. It's a very prestigious position, so André
                    Malraux, the writer, was a minister. And he established a tax, in a way, a maintenance tax on buildings. At
                    the time, the buildings of Paris were completely black because of the pollution from cars, and so all these
                    buildings , which are built in a very beautiful kind of yellowish stone, were in fact completely black.
                  </div>
                  <div><br /></div>
                  <div>

                      >Alain (00:46:48):</a
                    >
                    And so Malraux established an obligation for every owner of building to clean their façade every 10 years, I
                    think, which is quite expensive if you have a stone façade. It has to be done in a certain way. You cannot use
                    any chemical product because it will damage the stone. But the government took also the obligation to clean,
                    also, all the monuments, including Notre-Dame and all these monuments that are in France.
                  </div>
                  <div><br /></div>

                    So there is no doubt that it created a much more attractive Paris. There was a huge difference after the law
                    Malraux, but it made also housing much more expensive, because you had this large expenditure of maintenance
                    for the building. So you see, again, it's a thing which it's nice in a way, but it backfire on the people.
                    Paris is more attractive physically, but it eliminate the poorer people from Paris. And it was a government
                    decision, which I do not, by the way, necessarily criticize. I think that ...

                    But we should be aware when we do something like that, that we are making a tradeoff. And maybe for the image
                    of France and Paris, or maybe for the image that the French have their own country, it's a good thing to have
                    a very beautiful Paris with façades which are clean and nice. But it has a consequence socially, and maybe we
                    have to compensate the people who are losing by doing something in their province or something like that. I
                    mean, if we are aware of the consequence. The problem is beautifying an area without thinking of the impact it
                    will have on the people.

                    The Malraux law was not only for Paris, also the cities like Marseille. They have an obligation every 10 years
                    to clean the façade. And it's a budget that now is part of the maintenance, and I think it has, in the cities
                    in France, most of them, are so beautiful.

                    And they make a lot of effort, having flowers in the main street and on the entrance. And if you visit any
                    place in France, it's really so attractive and so much diversity from one place in France to the other, if you
                    go to Brittany, or if you go to Provence. It has so much character. It has so much beautiful.

                    It is unfortunate, though, that the building owners have to pay for it. Because it sounds like it's really an
                    externality from the drivers, so if I were the Queen of France, I think I would try to make it like a gas tax
                    or something to fund all of this.

                    Yes, I completely agree with you on that. But a gas tax will be paid by everybody, and especially now, a gas
                    tax is paid more by people who have old cars than people who have new cars, because there's a huge difference

                    owner of building who are paying." So therefore, a lot of people rent in Paris, so they feel they are not
                    affected. And in fact, they were affected. But I agree, yes, that would be the best way to do it.
                    Unfortunately, well, another thing which backfired, you're asking something which backfired ... No, you were

                    So, another thing which backfired in France, they discovered, when global warming start being a concern, that
                    a diesel car emit less carbon dioxide than the regular gasoline. So they decided to subsidize diesel, and so
                    they subsidized diesel to the point a liter of diesel used to cost, I think, half of the price of a liter of
                    gasoline because of the tax difference. And some other countries of Europe did the same thing.

                    So most manufacturer in Europe start making diesel cars, and then you realize that the diesel produce much
                    more pollution than the gasoline, and you end up with terrible air quality that was not like that before in
                    Paris and all that. So again, it's a goodwill subsidy to manipulate certain things which backfire. When you
                    introduce a subsidy in something, you have to be very, very careful about all the side effects.

                    Oh, dear. So it sounds like they just had the science wrong. They thought diesel was better, and it turned out
                    to actually be worse.

                    When Volkswagen cheated on the test, for them, they had invested so much in diesel, they didn't want ... They
                    knew that diesel was polluting, in all honesty. And when the European Union put those new law about pollution,
                    not only about carbon dioxide, but also NOx or particulates, they realized that they would have to retool
                    entirely, to move from diesel to something else.

                    There was no such thing as clean diesel. So they decided to cheat on the test, and they developed this very
                    clever software which could identify when the car was passing a test, and when it was on the road, so they
                    could cheat on the test. And then they could sell their cars passing the standards. And it was only discovered
                    in the United States by some academics who wanted to understand better all the pollution vary at different
                    speed on the road, and they realized that the tests were fake.

                    Wow, so it sounds like Volkswagen, in a certain way, was painted into a corner where they had been encouraged
                    by the government to do this diesel RMD, and develop cars that way, because it was subsidized, which is really
                    the government sort of blessing that entire direction. And then later on, the government turned around and was
                    like, "Okay, and we're going to add these other tests which actually make all of that investment that you've
                    made moot."

                    That's right, yeah. And by the way, first, it was Volkswagen who get caught. But then they discovered that
                    other manufacturer, like Renault for instance, did exactly the same thing. But they were not caught at the
                    same time. But, because again, it was a big ... I mean, I'm not so sure it was survival, but it was certainly
                    to their advantage. I mean, it would have caused a big financial upheaval if they had to suddenly convert all
                    their car from diesel to regular gasoline.

                    Yeah, and now the French government is subsidizing the electric cars, even the bicycle. If you have an old
                    bicycle now, if you want to go back to your bicycle and you need some little repair before you use your old
                    bicycle, you have a 50 Euro bonus if you go to a repair shop and the repair shop will charge you the price for
                    repairing your bike, but you will have, from the government, the 50 Euros so your price for repairing will be
                    less than it will have been normally. So there is all sort of things like this that the French love to get
                    from the government. The French have a feeling that these things are normal, everything has to be provided by
                    government.

                    But my problem with it is that as soon as you define a subsidy, you define also sometime a technology, so in a
                    way, you select a technology which is not necessarily the best when you start a new thing. For instance, you
                    know the French were probably the first to develop a quasi-Internet, run by government, what? In the '70s? The
                    Minitel. It was free. It was a government service, and it allows you from a terminal in your branch on the
                    telephone, in your house, for instance, to buy a train ticket or plane ticket or a thing like that. To check
                    the hours when films were playing in a cinema.

                    So it was a bit like the Internet, except you could not send messages to other people. You could send message
                    only to the administration and thing like that. You could probably pay your taxes that way. But it was free.
                    It was entirely subsidized by the government, so the more successful it was, the more expensive it became for
                    the tax payer. So eventually you don't make any more progress. You try to restrict the number of user, because
                    it costs so much. So it's opposite of a free enterprise, when they are successful. Then they can expend their
                    service and be cheaper.

                    Here, if it's free, then it becomes more expensive so you tend to restrict it. So eventually it disappeared,
                    and it was replaced by the Internet. But I think French there get to the Internet later, because they had this
                    Minitel in between which was, in a way, very convenient, but prevented them to shift to the Internet. I
                    remember debates with my mother about it. She was a big fan of the Minitel and she didn't want to hear about
                    computers, because she thought the Minitel was doing very well.

                    There is definitely a certain arrogance to subsidizing a particular technology, because you're really saying,
                    "We know enough. We're going to pick this winner and ignore all of the others." And the Minitel, it sounds
                    like, was actually quite useful, but with the diesel, clearly, they picked the wrong one.

                    Right, yeah. Well, you could ... We are talking about transport, so we could talk about the Concorde, too. The
                    Concorde was a government enterprise between the British and the French to subsidize transport, supersonic
                    transport, which was also a beautiful plane. I mean, it was well done. But commercially, completely unviable,
                    because the technology became effective, it manufactured the plane just at the time of the oil shock. So
                    gasoline was costing much more, and the Concorde, to fly between Paris and London and to New York, in terms of
                    gasoline I think it consumed something like five time more than the normal flight.

                    And the plane was much smaller. If you were a passenger, it was an enormous bill. So they had to subsidize
                    every passenger's ... The price on the Concorde was equivalent of a first class ticket plus 25%. There was no
                    other class. But even this first class ticket was subsidized, so they gave ... By the way, at the time, of
                    course Air France and British Airway could not even fill their plane with passengers at this price, so they
                    gave a discount to the World Bank so that we could use the Concorde. So it was very nice for us, of course,
                    and when I discovered that my champagne on the Concorde was subsidized by the French tax payer, I shifted to
                    British Airways. I thought, "Well, at least let the Brits will pay for my champagne."

                    justifying, because of the prestige of having a ... And they selected a technology at the wrong time. There is
                    another example like that, by the way. It was the slaughterhouse of Paris. Up to the '50s, '60s,
                    traditionally, the cattle were brought from the province to Paris and there were a number of slaughterhouses
                    in the northeast of Paris, where the cattle were slaughtered. A bit like the big slaughterhouse of Chicago in
                    the old days.

                    And then, the meat was distributed in Paris, but also then sent to the province by train, by refrigerated
                    train. So the government decided to have another slaughterhouse, which would consolidate all the smaller
                    slaughterhouses there in one area, and it was supposed to be all automatic. They introduced electronic in it.
                    A lot of people worked on it. It was apparently a superb system, when they just finished it. It took many
                    years and billions of dollars to finish it.

                    Suddenly the technology have changed, because refrigerated trucks became much cheaper than they were before.
                    And so there were a lot of very small slaughterhouses where the cattle were, in Normandy or wherever the
                    cattle were. And then the meat was sent already slaughtered, cut. Was sent to either Paris or wherever they
                    were going by refrigerated truck.

                    to do with it because nobody wanted to operate it. And so they decide to ... The only way ... The building

                    And then there were squatter in it, and the squatters were rock bands. You know, rock bands in Paris have the
                    problem that it makes a lot of noise, and Paris is dense. So it's difficult to play rock, to especially
                    rehearse rock music, without the neighbors complaining. So they found that moving into this enormous empty
                    structure, they could rehearse, the rock bands.

                    looking at alternatives ... Where money is no object, like the Concorde, can lead to some absurd things.

                    wholesale food market of Rungis was a success. You know, the other operation was to move Les Halles of Paris.
                    Les Halles, which was described by Zola, where you have this central food wholesale market in the middle of

                    It's interesting to think about which sorts of projects are appropriate for the government to take on and
                    which ones are not. I know you've spoken in the past about how important it is for some sort of central
                    system, most likely a government, to lay out the grid and certain types of infrastructure can be built on top.

                    What do you see as the dividing line between the types of projects that a government, and really, almost only
                    a government can do, and the sorts of things that should be left to the market and left to human ingenuity?

                    Infrastructure, I think, is certainly the main structure in our network, because if you have a network of
                    highways or trains, or ... You need to have the power of government to expropriate eminent domain. And because
                    when you acquire of right of way for a road or a train, you are supposed to pay market price for the land. But
                    it's not the market, because if somebody doesn't want to sell, this person is obliged to sell, because the
                    parcel of land is on the right of way. You don't have a choice to buy another piece of land, so it's not
                    really market.

                    So that, I think, the government has a monopoly on this possible acquisition of land. And that's why they are
                    better at developing infrastructure. But when it comes to selecting technology, I think they are not so good.
                    And that's what bother me with global warming, is that very often now governments are selecting technology
                    other than giving ...

                    One good example of government action is DARPA, in a way, or some project of DARPA, where instead of selecting
                    the technology, they define the performance. Performance is let's say, "We want a vehicle which will be self
                    driving in the desert, 100 miles, and that's the speed that is requirred." And that's the only thing they
                    define... And you have enough firms that compete ... And they give a price to the firms or researchers who
                    fulfill the requirement.

                    I think that's a good investment on the part of government. But mostly, I think that government could invest
                    not in technology, but in fundamental research, for which there is no real market. And fundamental research
                    now, we know in science, eventually we will have consequence for very, very useful and commercialized
                    technology.

                    That makes sense. So it sounds like the line here is infrastructure that requires something like eminent
                    domain, or requires coordination at a level that private company really couldn't provide. Because I think I
                    would say that internet access and something like Minitel to me seems like infrastructure, but what you're
                    saying is something like that doesn't actually require nearly as much coordination as building a train track,
                    because the train track has to cut through land that already exists whereas the internet system doesn't have
                    to do that as much.

                    Right, yeah. And if you have a server or a tower or something, you can move it wherever you want. I mean, you
                    have some requirement, it has to be a certain location, but you don't have an absolute location. Where
                    sometimes, for instance, if you have a water plant or a sewer treatment plant, there is usually an optimum
                    location for it, for environmental reasons. So then you have to use eminent domain for it. But those, of
                    course, could be after that could be operated by the private sector. But the initiative has probably to come
                    from the government.

                    I know the Japanese train system is almost entirely private, or entirely private. And I always wonder, since
                    they sort of operate like the government, and I'm sure that the Japanese government does have a lot of
                    communication with them about how things work, I've never totally understood how those public/private
                    partnership type things work. Can you speak a little bit to that, and how decisions are made by private
                    companies?

                    The water company in France has always been private since ever, for some reason. So the government of course
                    regulates them, because it's a utility and they have a natural monopoly. But they operate it privately and
                    competitively. The same with the highways. There is a network of highways in France which was entirely
                    developed privately, although the rights of way were acquired by the government and let's say, linking which
                    city to which other city was decided by government ...

                    But as soon as the design was done, it was entirely built and operated, and is still now operated, privately.
                    So they are all toll roads, by the way. All the highways in France have toll roads, and they are private toll
                    roads. And one problem has been in developing country, where the government is usually rather ineffective.
                    They are very weak, technically. The people who have a lot of technical skill very often go in the private
                    sector, not in the government.

                    So there have been a tendency at the beginning with the financing by the WorldBbank to say, "Well, why don't
                    we ask the private sector to operate like France's water supply, or develop a water supply system?" And it has
                    not been very good, because if the government is not good at supervising this, this public/private
                    partnership, then it's a complete disaster because you have a private monopoly, and it doesn't work very well.

                    So in a way, it's only country where the government is pretty competent that you can increase the efficiency
                    by introducing the private sector. If you introduce the private sector in a monopoly situation like the water
                    supply, for instance, but with a very weak government, you will end up with a pretty bad result.

                    government operate it then it's not competent. It's not very good.

                    I think it comes slowly, through democracy and information. I don't think there are steps, magic steps that
                    you can do for ... The press has a role to play. For instance, I have seen in India where there is really a
                    free press, and very kind of dynamic. The press have pretty good journalists who are really digging into a
                    problem like water supply or transport, or even building regulations. And they do a pretty good job, and
                    eventually, they have enough middle class who read the newspaper and read those technical article so that it
                    create a constituency for reform and better services. So I think that this is ...

                    But it's a long thing. It's not something you do in three years or four years. And it has, in a way, very
                    little to do with the amount of money you put in it. The World Bank has tried many time to reform governments,
                    to give incentive either by paying them more, by training, by all sort of thing, to have better government in
                    country which had weak government. And it has to come from the people.

                    It sounds like a recurring theme here, is that you can make a lot of infrastructure changes and they might
                    make a difference. But if the people don't really care for it, or if the cultural norms say that something is
                    low status, then they're not going to use it.

                    You mentioned in some middle income countries, owning a car is a big status symbol. Maybe you could make the
                    buses as nice as you want, but those people are probably going to keep driving their car because it sort of
                    heightens them and makes them feel good about themselves, and separates them from other people. So you have to
                    change the culture before you can really change the infrastructure.

                    We're coming up on our time now, and I have so many more questions, so I think we're going to have to save the
                    second half of this for a part two on the transportation topic. But this was so much fun, as always, and is
                    there anything else that you two want to add before we sign off?
